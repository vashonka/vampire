"I just wanted one pair of navy pokadot socks but had to buy a variety pack.  They are comfortable, fit well and washed nicely.  I would recommend."
"Ordered these as a cheaper alternative to my usual and am a big disappointed. They are soft, but after wearing one time there are holes at the toe seam. They are not durable at all. There is no ribbing at the ankles so they slide down a bit. They're not horrible for the price, but I wouldn't be buying again."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I have ordered these twice now. I wear these socks for work and I walk 20,000+ steps a day. Having a sock that is breathable, thin, and feels comfortable on my feet is super important. These are exactly that. It has taken multiple wears and washes to get my first hole. When I do finally get a hole, it’s always in the toe area, never the sole. They also give the appearance of a dress sock so you can wear these with ballet shoes and slacks.10/10 recommend if you are looking for a light but durable sock."
"Great socks..wash nicely, no stretching or shrinking...comfortable,  and nice fit...would purchase again.."
"Liked them for my 5 year old so much, I bought them twice. Sturdy and sized correctly. Size medium."
They are great for those tough boys! They look good and are soft and a heavier sock. Purchased for my 7 yr old grandson.
"great fit, good quality, price was right, arrived on time."
Sizing was very confusing to me-maybe Iâ€™m just dumb.Ordered for my 5 YO nephew his feet do not fit the size 1.5 sketchers shoes I bought him but these fit perfect his feet r to big for size 13 hope this helps everyone
"The socks are soft, stretchy, durable, don't fade in the wash. The only thing I don't like about them is that they have lots of piles and everything sticks to them even after washing through heavy washing machine.The adult version of these socks don't do that, we have the men's and women's versions of these exact socks and the adult ones do not have piling on the bottom and stuff sticking to them, only the children's.But we love everything else about these socks and will buy them again."
"Donâ€™t usually get overly excited on SOCKS, but what a great price for the exact product that I was looking for !Wear a womenâ€™s 7 1/2 shoe and these boys LARGE, fit perfectly."
My son loves these socks. The are very comfortable. Great fit and great value for the money.
Great socks! Last a long time! Buying more!
Very soft
Love these new socks that I purchased! First of all my shoe size is between 6.5 -7…. I ordered a small in these and they are perfect. They are well cushioned but not too thick and love the design on them. Got the gray ones with a hint of color on them. I will be getting more when I need them. I wear them around the house on my wood floors and feel I go through a lot of ankle socks.
These are almost the only socks I have. I love the overall fit and length. They are high enough that shoes do not rub on the back of my ankle. They feel very comfortable and supportive with just enough stretch. I will definitely be ordering these again in the future.
"Bought these for a trip during the summer time. They have lasted quite a while, have yet to get any wears or loose threads on them. They were thick enough and had the extra backing to not rub against my shoe. Cute and fun colors, had compliments on the bright red/orange ones. They are still soft to this day and have not shrunk on me, has some stretch still left on it.  Regarding the size, I am typically between 7.5 - 8, wide-ish and no complaints on the medium fitting me."
"This is my second purchase of these and I love them. They’re comfortable socks they’re durable they do not fade. You can walk outside with them on and they don’t get holes in them. I use them for work socks, but for the most part, they’re cute stylish they go with just about every color and they’re padded on the bottom so your feet are comfortable in your shoes, especially if you stand on your feet for a long time throughout the day ! it’s a great purchase try them out and if you don’t think you like them then don’t give them five stars. I’m going to can’t beat that. It’s always good to have socks that you love. Otherwise they just stay there looking lonely in the sock drawer saying hey, how come you don’t wear me ha ha ha anyways, it’s a great product there well-made I haven’t ever gotten any holes!"
The socks are comfortable and great buy for the price.
"At first I was worried they were too big when I first received them, but after washing they fit perfectly (I chose my size using the provided size chart). I like how they're the perfect amount of thickness, and how they have extra padding at the heel. They're also really soft and don't feel cheap or thin. I've been using them for a month or so, and were exactly what I needed for the variety of exercise I do. I'd recommend them if you're looking for a good workout sock set; they're not the most visually appealing but they absolutely get the job done."
So comfy and good quality. I also really love the little tab on the back because I always feel like my socks are falling down but this tab makes it so easy to keep them at a comfortable spot. They’re also really warm and cozy  but not too snug. Would recommend!
"I bought a pack of these 4 years ago & absolutely love them. I work out 3-5 days a week wearing these socks & just now does 1 sock have a tiny hole in it! Definitely going to order another pack because I want to start to work out more, & these are the only socks I wear. They stay in place, absorb moisture well, & are just very comfortable. Highly recommend!!"
So comfortable. Great fit. They don't slip down into my shoe even when running 5-10 km. My feet are a size 9 ladies
"I love saucony ankle socks, so when I need more, I always come back for these. They last a really long time and don't break down easily, and they don't slide off your heel in the shoe. They are also very comfortable and stretchy, and the elastic doesn't bite into your ankles like some other socks I have had! Very comfy socks, and I like the colour combos. Fit easily on the higher end of foot size."
Fit as expected. Very comfortable and wash well.
"Very happy with my purchase. Socks are comfortable, not too tight and they don’t slip down which is a huge plus. And I really like the colours."
These are thick and cushy. Seems well made and they're breathable so my feet stay dry. I'm super picky about socks but so far they fit great and stay up. They do ball up some on the outside after washing so keep that in mind. The left sock was washed and the right is unwashed for comparison. They're work socks for me so it's not that big of a deal. I just pick them off and go on.
"I recently purchased these 6-pack of quarter socks from Amazon, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. These socks are exactly what I was looking for: comfortable, durable, and affordable.Comfort: The socks have a great fit, hugging my feet just right without being too tight or too loose. The fabric is soft and breathable, making them perfect for everyday wear. Even after a long day, my feet feel comfortable and dry.Durability: After several washes, these socks have held up remarkably well. No signs of wear and tear, and they haven't lost their shape. The quality is definitely impressive, especially considering the price.Value for Money: Getting a 6-pack for this price is a fantastic deal. It’s always nice to have extra pairs on hand, and this pack offers excellent value without compromising on quality.Versatility: These quarter socks are great for various activities. I've worn them for casual outings, workouts, and even while lounging at home. They provide good support and stay in place throughout the day.Design: The socks come in a classic, clean design that goes well with different types of shoes. Whether I’m wearing sneakers, loafers, or casual shoes, they look great.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with these quarter socks. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of high-quality socks at an affordable price."
"These ankle length socks are truly xxl size and they fit my size 13 feet very well. I would guess they’re good for up to size 14 or so. They are soft, stretchy and thick on the bottom. Overall I like the quality look and color, they stay in place and they should last."
"I bought these coming from wearing Hanes X-Temp socks for years. These are about the same quality in my opinion. The price point is good. These are a bit thicker than the Hanes X-Temp.What I like:They're comfortable enough.They're slightly thicker.I think they're a bit better at preventing blisters.What I don't like:They're pretty big. I think if you can size down if you're in the middle of the listed sizes.Overall, they're pretty good. If you're looking for bargain socks, they are totally fine. About on par for the Hanes X-Temp."
"I'm a FedEx delivery driver, and am on my feet between walking and running 3 to 5 miles a day. These socks breathe well and are comfortable. They are a little big so keep that in mind when ordering."
"Have not washed/dried yet, but they feel just right out of the package. Not loose on my foot, but not compressing my foot. I had tried some from another brand and Straight out of the package. They were already slightly compressing, my foot, and the reviews on that one said there was a lot of shrinkage after a wash/dry cycle. If there is significant shrinkage and compressing on my foot, I will try and update my review. So far incredibly pleased with the fit and thickness. (Which is about middle of the road, not too thin and not overly thick)"
"I have purchased every type of Dickies socks and they all hold up. The cut is the best part, they fit so well. The ""HI-VIS"" type are different from the rest. They are thinner like athletic socks and are best for summer."
"I wear a pair of these socks to work every day in the summer with my shorts and safety shoes.  They lasted three full summers before they started showing thin spots, but there are still no holes.  They've remained absorbent and comfortable.They've been worn a full day (about 10 hours), washed, and dried about 60-70 times for each sock (one wear per week over a 20-24 week summer season, times three summers) and they've held up this long, and for the price that's impressive.They're comfortable, have good cushioning, and I liked them so well that I ordered the same socks again today.  It's a great value because these socks have outlasted their price point."
"I have a hard time finding socks that fit my very tall son, I love that these come in very large sizes. They have the right amount of elastic to hold them nicely in place without being too tight and leaving deep marks in his legs, and they are easy for him to put on which is important since he has a disability and it can take a long time and be very frustrating if they are too tight. He seems to think they are comfortable. So far they are holding up well, hopefully they are durable but he’s only worn them a couple of times."
They are  more light brown than beige .
"Socks are very comfortable. The cotton has held up very well after multiple washes (Have washed about 12 times so far). They definitely keep your feet warm, but also breathe at the same time. I can appreciate the weight and thickness of them. They do feel quality. They fit my size 14 foot very well."
I have a size 14 shoe so most standard socks are just missing the mark.I bought these for wearing in boots. They are pretty tough.Not as tough as wool socks but they are a good weight and medium thickness for the Southeastern US.The warmth is nice but not overly so. The socks pull up high and keep boot tops from rubbing your legs.Definitely would buy again and highly recommend.
"Hanes Men's Work Socks, 6-PackWhat can I say, socks are socks.I wear them till they become worn then replace them.I look for comfort, good fit, good wear.  Color is an option.I generally have concern over fit as my feet are kind of smalland I just dont fit anything off the shelf, so you can bet if Isay they fit well, I know what I am talking about.RECOMMENDEDI do not know the seller nor did I get any product for my random review.241010 0120"
I got these for work while money was a little tight and to my surprise they are fantastic. I usually wear something built more durable and long lasting (without listing brands) and in comparison I would recommend these and even consider purchasing more.
"Got these for my partner. I love that it comes in the same color, it makes it easier for me and him. We haven't had it for long but it seems durable and is quite thick, which is great for him to keep warm. It fits great and there's no problems when washing.10/10 it's worth it, if you like thick socks!"
Again purchased on a coupon deal for a Christmas present. Really liked the description of the easiness of the material that’s described. I believe my husband will enjoy the comfort and dryness material they are made of.
"Lot of features for socks, very elastic and comfortable.  Very breathable."
"If you have regular size legs these might be fine for you, but if you have ""Dad Calves"" or larger calves than a 16 year old then you probably want to buy something else."
Very comfortable socks at a decent price.
"I had bought these socks about 3 years ago. What I received are muck smaller in circumference ie very tight around my ankles lower leg! Not acceptable to me! I would like a full refund today, and would like to throw away these ""work"" socks both in black and in white!"
Very comfortable
"Perfect socks! The stay on great, excellent fit! Very cushiony socks and not too thin! I canâ€™t stop buying these socks! Breathable, soft, not too short! I definitely recommend these socks! Look no further!"
"These Hanes womenâ€™s low-cut socks are a great choice for everyday wear. They are soft, moisture-wicking, and very comfortable. Hanes is a brand I can always count on for quality, and these socks are no exception. The 10-pack offers excellent value, making them my go-to option for daily use. Simple, classic, and dependable."
"I've been using the Hanes Women's Value, Low Cut Soft Moisture-Wicking Socks for a few weeks now, and I'm really impressed. These socks have quickly become my go-to choice for daily wear.What I Liked:Comfort: These socks are incredibly soft and comfortable. The moisture-wicking fabric keeps my feet dry and fresh all day long.Stretch: The socks have just the right amount of stretch. They fit snugly without being too tight, which is perfect for my active lifestyle.Sheerness: They're not too thick or too thin â€“ just the right balance for everyday use. They work well with all types of shoes, from sneakers to flats.What I Disliked:Honestly, I havenâ€™t found anything to dislike about these socks. They meet all my expectations and more.Overall:I highly recommend the Hanes Women's Value, Low Cut Soft Moisture-Wicking Socks. Theyâ€™re comfortable, durable, and a great value for the price. Perfect for anyone looking for reliable everyday socks."
They fit well and are very comfortable.
"if you just want some new, cheaper socks, these are totally acceptable. i think itâ€™s a slick hack fo buy a ton of the same sock so you dont have to worry about matching them up.theyâ€™re comfortable, easy to wash and put away since they all look the same and are a true black, are pretty breathable and comfortable, and have a good stretch while still being form fitting (i wear a 7.5 in womenâ€™s). and theres no slip resistance so you will slip n slide on hardwood.as far as longevity, i cant imagine these holding up as long as my nike socks have. they pill (create little balls) quite a bit. the fuzz on the inside gets caught under my toes after a dayâ€™s wear (i finally put two and two together because every time i would get in the shower, iâ€™d see the black fuzz go down the drain from my feet). they also are not super thick, very mid level/average thickness so i worry theyâ€™ll wear pretty soon in the heels and toes areas.but i dont want to deter you from buying these at all because hanes is a great brand and theyre genuinely pretty good socks, hence the 4 out of 5 starts. i would order them again generally speaking, but i plan on just saving up for some quality dri fit nike socks since my last bunch lasted me 4-5 years before just starting to show wear in a couple pairs now.so overall? i would genuinely recommend these if youre on a budget and just want to get some more socks in your drawer. theyre totally fine and after a month or so of wearing, i do enjoy them for every day wear, gym wear (i take off my shoes for leg days for balance purposes and theyre good), and for walks. just keep in mind that they may or may not last more than 3 years before they start wearing out. and ultimately, i think by that time, you could reorder them or get something more quality and be fine. so you can purchase with a general sense of confidence :)"
These are nice socks. I was looking for something with a low fit. They are very comfortable.Good purchase!
"Can never go wrong with black socks, these are very comfortable and soft"
"This stretches enough to be comfortable on my wider feet, without feeling restrictive. Have held up nicely after washing multiple times."
When I first took them out of the package I was so disappointed thinking they were way too small. BUT .. they stretch to fit perfectly!!!!! And soft as anything! I thought maybe they wouldn't be so great after washing but they are - they stretch just as well as right out of the package. Highly recommend. Great socks!
These fit my size 10.5 foot and stay up at the heel inside the shoe.
Purchased for my husband. Heâ€™s satisfied.
"Slow delivery but good product. Want these style of socks with no logo, so does the job."
"Pretty good quality socks for the price, will be ordereding another batch.They're thin from the top and thicker at the bottom, feels light at the top and cushy at the bottom, they also fit nice and they don't slip off easily... absolutely love those socks!"
"Overall the product is amazing, best in price."
Comfortable and good fit
This was purchased as a gift and I could not be more pleased. The colors are vibrant and go on smooth. I love that it has vibrant colors and naturals and so many to colors. I was skeptical at first but glad I purchased this and will purchase the other colors as well. It also came with brushes that are good for the price. You wont be disappointed with this purchase!
"i never write reviews but i’ve now had this one palette for YEARS and it’s been tried and true through and through. the colors are excellent and pigmented, and the glitter shadows are glitter all the way down to the last drop. i haven’t had to purchase a high end, celebrity makeup palette since i really started getting into makeup because this one has been so reliable. i’m sure the quality of the pigments themselves aren’t near as good as any of the more expensive palettes, but for what you pay they are 100% worth. not to mention, the highlighter is INSANE! my favorite highlighter ever and no matter how much i search i can’t find one like the one in this palette. it has a soft creamy texture that makes it easy to apply and it retains its shine throughout the whole day. a lot of other highlighters are half the price of this whole palette and yet they’re basically white dust with very little sparkle to em. this SPARKLES! if you’re looking for a long-lasting, good value, easy to use palette, i highly recommend this one. 10/10"
"Quality is good! My daughter will use it for Halloween makeup and just to do her make up. Has different colors, which I like about it and brushes work great no issues at all."
"I really like this eye shadow pallet. The pigment is really good. Colors are beautiful, and lots to choose from.However, some colors tend fall easily off the lid/brush when applying and then smudge easily on your face. So, BE sure wear a good primer, and maybe apply eye shadow first vs makeup if you don't already.The brush set, SUCKS. I'm sorry, but it does. Get a well made brush set, I feel these are more like paint brushes. I tried these vs my good make up brushes and the results are way different.Otherwise, I really really like this eye shadow!One picture is the beginning on the night in costume with black wig, and the other picture is end of the night, hours later. Make up is just slightly messed up, due to it being HOT."
Love the colors and the brushes
I hope my daughters love it
This makeup pallet has such quality and my little girl loves it!! Perfect for younger girls who want to play dress up!
I bought one of these as a beginner set for my niece and liked it so much I bought one for myself. The pigment quality is outstanding. They are bright and long lasting. They look like I just applied them at the end of the day. The hot pink color is my favorite eyeshadow EVER. I have a big drawer full of very expensive department store and designer shadows but these are my go-to now. They really are fabulous! The glitter shades are a bit messy but I've never used one that wasn't. If you want to travel with this kit I would suggest you put it in a bag of some sort bc once used the powders do form a residue that could possibly flake off and stain your clothes. Other than that this is a wonderful kit that is too much fun for the price. Plus it comes with brushes! You can never have enough brushes!
"this ""fold"" of eye shadow colors (over 80) with the brushes...the daughter loves it. they are even good enough to mix for other makeup uses. I just gave it to my daughter today around 2pm and she's already (it's around 7pm) used it for around 1-1 1/2 hours... she can't say enough good things about the quality. for the price, just over $30, it beyond great (as far as she's concerned. will be, as will she, be looking to buy more products from this company, odds are this package again... she even was able to mix them to create new colors... this purchase is NOT regretted, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
