"I bought this to take photos of jewelry I sell. The diffuser doesn't work that great. Still too much glare even at different angles. So I can't use the top section to take pictures because then the glare is way too much. I take pictures of fine jewelry with gemstones and glass cabachons with art work in the bezel. The reflection of the glass at any angle is do bad it distorts the actual art work.  It is nice quality, and may work well for certain items just not what I need it for."

"I just received my Poluz 16 x 16 photo box. I have not had a chance to use it consistently or on a regular basis, so this review is based off my first impression.It seems like my package had been torn open or possibly opened before, or perhaps a return judging from the box. The blue and salmon colored backgrounds were dirty; the salmon colored one definitely has been used!The pro‚Äôs are that it‚Äôs extremely easy to use, does the job and is a good value for the money. The diffuser cloth helps with reflections from the led lights. The many different backgrounds are a huge plus, there‚Äôs a great variety. Easy set up and break down.The cons are that it arrived possibly used/2 backdrops are dirty. Because I don‚Äôt plan to use those particular back drops that much, and I want to hurry up and start using this‚ÄîI will probably just hold on to itüôÑüòë but I‚Äôd like to return or exchange for a new one. I also wish the LED lights lit up brighter, but it will do the job. I also wanted to be able to shoot objects with a consistent light source or consistent look ‚Äîso it will do that. Doesn‚Äôt come with USB power adapter.Overall, would recommend but hopefully you will get one that is new new, clean and perfect. Good choice for a grinding artist, photographer or seller that just needs to get it done."

"The Mini Photo Studio Light Box has been perfect for taking product shots. It‚Äôs easy to set up, and the built-in lights provide even, bright illumination, which really enhances photo quality. The multiple backgrounds are a nice touch for adding variety. It‚Äôs compact but gives a professional feel to my photos. Great value for a portable mini studio!"
I love my picture box! It‚Äôs taken my staging game up a notch and makes my advertising look so professional and clear.I do wish they‚Äôd sell their backgrounds Separately and maybe come up with some new colours and schemes.
"* Easy to assemble* Incredibly good lighting* Very user-friendly with the control to adjust lighting* Incredibly nice result (with the right camera equipment)* The size is right for my products (grocery products)Recommend the product for every penny, absolutely nothing to complain about.I drive with my iPhone and am happy with the results"
Came well packaged with nice storage bags and love the backgrounds. Easy to assemble and came with all working parts.
We used this for my church directory photos and it was so easy to set up and take down. Great product.
I really like the stand. It’s very easy to use and set up. It stayed put and the extras. The only thing I didn’t like are the backdrops. They are literally bedsheets with a pocket for the poles. Will be buying better backdrops.
"I liked it a lot, and I loved the quality, I know it will be a blessing and very useful for my business. 100/10"
"I was fortunate enough to get this on a flash deal and I’m so glad I did! Everything is superb quality and comes securely packed. Everything fits in the case it comes with and that makes it easy to travel! Everything has its own bag or box and that also makes everything a lot more safe and organized. The lighting quality is also really great! I would definitely recommend this to any content creator or any kind! I’ve been able to do product shoots, portrait photography, videos, and stop motion animation with this bundle!"
"i love this light kit. it’s easy to set up, the lights stay cool and consistent and it’s super easy to set up and tear down."
Great for start up booth. Have taken photo shoots & headshots with this booth. Need to iron cloths

"I was concerned about purchasing this set due to reviews about how flimsy the set was but I was pleasantly surprised.Granted, the set is of not top quality but you are not paying for it either.  People complaining about tripods falling is because they do not know how to work with tripods.  I used the set to take picture of heavy hoists and never had an issue if you know how to move around a photographic set.Pros: Easy to setup.  Nice tripod and bars.  4 sets of lights.Cons: lights too weak.  45w are not enough for us.  Quality of the white backdrop is not good as good as the one we already had.  Reflector bag came ripped but we can live with it.Overall, we are very satisfied with the product."
"Everything was complete and neatly packaged in the shipping boxes.  Yes, the backdrop stand allows the green screen to sag a bit, and the material is a bit sheer,  but we mounted the green screen to the wall and will use the stand when we need to travel with the equipment.  We purchased this for our son's birthday and he loves it.  Best part is that all this equipment, when set up, fits into the small space of his room and allows his bedroom to become a production studio.  Absolutely the perfect gift for YouTubers."
"If your getting into Photography, great set to start with"
I set up the equipment and backdrop last night and I am quite happy with it so far! It seems a little unstable for the back drop if you put all 4 bars in it but I used it with 3 bars and it's more sturdy! I am quite happy with my purchase so far. I am going to use it on a newborn photoshoot in a couple days!
"Seems to be a great product, first time buyer and beginner, easy to assemble, straightforward, came with all parts, took maybe 15 minutes to assemble."
After comparing several lighting options I selected this one for the price and hoped the quality would be good. It arrived on time and was everything I expected. Easy set up and great quality items. I was able to set up everything myself for an indoor shoot and it exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend!
"You get a lot of items for the price. I dropped a bulb and broke it right off the bat. Sigh. At least, there was still enough bulbs to fit into the two boxes I‚Äôll use most of the time.  I‚Äôm pretty happy with my purchase. So many different photography items in one box"
"Pros: Love the kit , definitely worth buying the kit for the price it is selling for. It‚Äôs definitely worth it for someone who is trying to start off in photography! Stands and poles are sturdy, light bulbs included, sand bag included, 3 soft boxes, 2 silver umbrellas, 1 gold umbrella & 2 white umbrellas, backdrop stand, 3 backdrops (white, black & green) & a case to hold everything. Unfortunately my kit was missing the clamps and the reflectors but overall for the price - it was a good purchase.Cons: light bulbs are not bright enough (a lot of comments saying they changed to LED lights bulbs which made a huge difference), wires are not long enough so you‚Äôll need multiple extension cords, the backdrops are super thin so they are see-through so I‚Äôd suggest putting the black one behind the white backdrop if you're going to use the white one or green to block out the back lighting."
"For this price, you get a lot more than what you needed and paid for! The box was super heavy, I could lift it up myself that my husband has to help me. I set everything up and see which or what kind of lighting works better for me. Light works very great for indoor. I would love to try outdoor maybe in the future. I used it to take photos of my kids and portrait for my business cards. It is very easy to use and comes with bags for every items and a big bag to put everything in."
This came sooo quickly and so far so good! Everything looks great ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"One of my lights came broken, Great setup and Still worth it, but send me a new bulb please?"
"Easy set up for beginners, or people with basic to moderate photography knowledge. Great selection of things for when you‚Äôre on a budget or in between jobs. It was perfect for my headshot session. The cloth backgrounds are the only complaint I have, they never look good to me personally. I would‚Äôve loved this set more if it had a paper background option instead. All around, really quality set!"
You get a lot of useful stuff to control the lighting for photo or even video projects. I personally switched out the CFLs for color changing LED bulbs which made the system even more versatile but did increase the cost. I highly recommend this kit for anyone getting started in photography or videography.
"These softbox lights are excellent! The quality is great, they are easy to set up, and the lighting is perfect for photography or video projects. The set includes everything you need, and the carrying bag is a nice bonus for portability."
"10/10.Only 1 light type, make sure you know that! it works perfectly for our content wall though for sure. Great, great lights. Super easy set up. really nice packaging. really nice usage."
"I received the dual kit today which I bought with a $10.50 discount.  Which means for $65.38 I got two lights with stand, the hood and the cover to make it a softbox light.I agree this is not professional equipment.  However, for $65.00 I wouldn't be able to buy one complete professional softbox.  In fact, I would probably need to spend at minimum another $100 just to get the cheapest professional gear.All that being said.  I am not a professional but an amateur and I do this mostly as a hobby.  I am very happy to have two of these lights and I am happy to say that mine came packed expertly and everything came in full working order.  I love that it all has a carrying case and that the light bulbs came inside a box with molded Styrofoam.I am very satisfied and I have to say after testing it on some self portraits today, I am very satisfied.  What I really like about this is that I can remove the cover of the softbox and almost use it as an umbrella light.I uploaded some self-portraits and a view of the setup.  The first photo with the softer tones it's the softbox with the cover and the second without the cover.  I also show the setup with the light off and on.If you are looking for a sturdy, professional equipment which will stand the test of time.  This is probably not the equipment you want.  If you are an amateur or beginning and have a limited budget then this will probably serve you well, provided you take care of it.A note of caution.  When extending the legs there is a sweet spot where the legs have the most spread.  Below or above that spot the area the legs spread is smaller and may cause the equipment to fall over.  See the images for what I mean.  The way the stand works is almost like how an umbrella opens and so you'll have to take care to make sure leave about 3 to 4 inches from the bottom of the pole to the junction of the legs (see images for visual)."
"I recently purchased two softboxes for improving my video lighting setup as a full-time remote worker. Overall, I found them to be easy to assemble and effective for the price point.The assembly process was straightforward, and I appreciated the simplicity of putting them together. They provide excellent lighting for my video calls and work well for my needs.While the included bag adds convenience for storage and transportation, I found the kickstands to be somewhat flimsy. To prevent them from easily tipping over, I would recommend weighting them down. However, despite this minor issue, they haven’t fallen over on their own, which is reassuring.In conclusion, these softboxes have successfully fulfilled their purpose for me, and I would consider purchasing them again. Despite the slight inconvenience with the kickstands, they offer good value for the price and I recommend them for anyone looking to enhance their WFH video lighting setup."
"Overall this is an amazing set of lights. The quality of photos and videos is much better. Perception of depth is good as well once you start using these lights.Setup: All the items comes very well boxed and packaged by the manufacturer. The setup process was fairly easy and took less than 10 minutes to unpack and setup for the first useQuality: The box comes with a pair of bulbs, nicely boxed in. Once set up the light was adequate enough for some great shots. This is very good for a home studio or vlogging setup.Stand: The stand itself was a bit tricky to assemble for the first time. However, once I got used to the first one setting up the second one was a breeze. The only issue I saw was that above 5 feet, the stand being top heavy becomes a bit unstable. i had to adjust the legs again to give the unit some stability. Once you are aware of this, you will be able to take care of ensuring the legs are supporting the unit well and stable.The wires are also heavy and when the stand is farther way from a power source, extending the wires can make the stand unstable as well. This is the same for most other softbox kits as well. So not restricted to the Neewer ones alone.Highly recommend this gear for amateur or professional setup."
"Far from “premium quality”, but they work fine and I’m sure they will last a long time if they aren’t abused or put up/down all of the time."
Good cost affordable solution for office lighting.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



It shipped really fast. It was easy to assemble, took me less than 3 minutes to get it working.  This was a micro milestone for my small business. My product photo quality has been drastically improved. Getting professional product photos is everything nowadays for online retail. If you are starting an online retail business or needing professional photos, i’d highly recommend getting one of these."
"First off, everything arrived in good condition and I set them up very easily on my own. I'm a webcam model so I needed some good lighting for my videos and streaming online at a good price. I had looked around on amazon.com and amazon.ca for a while for something available that suited my needs. I ended up going for this one and was worried the lighting may not be warm enough but I have just tried them and filmed a short 30 sec video to test them out and WOW!!! They are pretty amazing. The room I am in is small and has no window and a very dim ceiling light and yet I look so clear and well lit. If you wanted it to be a bit brighter then I would suggest a using a window, or just some extra lights would do the trick but I like the amount of light they provide and for my needs they are perfect!"
"There are no instructions to put this together, although not hard, it is possible to be a little bit confusing.So far the lights are going great!  I am a amateur and just starting out in taking pictures and making youtube videos so these lights work great for me so far. I was worried even though all the online reviews and videos show that it goes very bright even in basements and it does a fairly good job. I live in a condo and all the lights emit a bright orange colour so all my videos and pictures are always orange when I take them. But with this I noticed an immediate difference and no longer is there any orange in my pictures or vids.Overall, I thought this was a decent deal and a good product so far."
I used it for a couple shoots and it works pretty good. not a crazy brightness but it does the job. however if you are taking pictures of a group of people it's harder to bring the lights close enough to illuminate the subject and not have them in the frame. For a one subject shoot it's perfect for a beginner. I recommend this product for beginners. Pretty good price for what you get.
Didn't have to wait long for it to arrive . Other reviews talked about not having instructions to put it together but it was super easy to do. Had it assembled very quickly. The stands are a little flimsy but if you are careful not to bump into it there should be no problem. Lights are huge (and bright). I am very pleased with the quality for the price and would recommend this product.
"I gotta say, for how much I spent, it's appreciated whenever I buy appliances that require light bulbs come packaged WITH lightbulbs!The softboxes provide even and diffused light, ensuring professional-quality results for both photography and video shoots. With 3 color background screens included, this kit offers versatility for various shooting scenarios, allowing for creativity and flexibility.The backdrop stands and tripod stands are robustly constructed, providing stability during shoots. Additionally, the setup is straightforward, saving time and effort, and with easy-to-carry tote bags included, I can setup and disassemble in less than 10 minutes.Considering the comprehensive kit with backdrop stands, softboxes, tripod stands, and color background screens, this product offers exceptional value for both amateur and professional photographers and videographers."
"This set has everything you need for a setup to take pictures or videos! The stands adjust easily and to many different positions. It all feels well built and like it will hold up to use for a long time. I love the options for the lighting to get different effects. It stores easily in the storage bag. There is plenty of room for everything, so I don‚Äôt have to fight to fit it in the bag. This is a great set and definitely worth the price! To buy everything separately, it would cost A LOT more!"
"I have had my camera for a year now and I have wanted to see if k can buy something like this, when it came it had everything, nothing broken or missing and it all worked perfectly. It‚Äôs great for starters or anyone who loves photography and wants to do photo shootsI have done only one photo shoot and it was before I bough this, I was nervous but getting paid good money and the person wasn‚Äôt very happy since I didn‚Äôt bring equipment like lights, background, tripods, etc‚Ä¶So with the money she gave me I bough this, thinking it wasn‚Äôt gonna work out it came in and I posted it online and everyone is now interested in photo shoots with payNot only that, you can also use this as an advantage for other types of stuff like videos, movies, auditions, etc‚Ä¶The instruction manuals are very clear and shows you what the box is supposed to bring, the cool thing is that you can put EVERYTHING in one bag, it will be heavy but at least you can carry it around and not have it hang out in the way.I have a friend who has been a photographer for many years and this is the same setup she bought the first year she started and to this day she hasn‚Äôt changed from it100% Worth It!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I liked the configuration of this set. I can't wait to make creative videos at home. There are very powerful lamps, remote controls, there are several changeable backgrounds, all tripod mounts are of good quality, thank you."
I really like this kit. The entire kit is lightweight. I am able to set it up under 10 minutes. I did not know that there were going to be three backdrops which is so cool. The lights aren‚Äôt the best but they do just great for the quality of photoshoot I wanted. I also like how there are options for different kind of shoots.
"Haven‚Äôt used yet, but set it up, and that was easy"
"I needed some black background for video and white for photography, these are lightweight yet sturdy, I may use the lights for backlighting but not as main lights,  I love that everything comes in a bag and some things are separated into their own bags inside the main bag, would have liked for the actual backdrops to be a little bigger but it's decent enough for my current needs."
"At first, when I opened the box, I was afraid there were no instructions. But they were at the bottom. Very clear pictures of how to assemble. Which was needed because since this is such a comprehensive kit, there are lots of different poles to connect to the lighting and some to hang the green screen on. The green screen was quite wrinkly, and I needed to wash and dry it to get the wrinkles out before being able to use it. It was surprisingly great value for how much it cost. They are all very sturdy and definitely is a great starter kit for podcasting."
"The frame was sturdy but I could not figure out how to put it together.  The boxing was not good.  Wrapped around middle was a box in an oversized box.  I supposed it broke or was opened in transit by postal for inspection.  One light did not work.  Check lighting recommendations on YouTube by coaches... One suggested a light set with 40 watts and around$100,... then read the reviews of those light fixtures.  I did not keep this, but returned it."
Easy to assemble and portable! The material wasn‚Äôt flimsy and it‚Äôs easy to store. The clamps were a life saver to keep the sheets from swaying. Also great length coverage! The gold was an 8 feet by 8 feet
"Awesome stand, light weight, easy to assemble and move around. üëå and"
"Giving this a 5 star for the easy set up.  I think with the little black sandbags given it is more for indoor use.  I used this stand outside to take school pictures for two days.  Both days were not that windy however the first day we got just a little breeze every now and then. The stand FELL OVER multiple times with the little breezes of wind. Nothing gusty! Light gently breezes really. Very frustrating.  Second day as you can see in my picture here I used my friends much bigger and heavier sandbags.  They worked much better! I still like this set up and the title does say studio, so for indoor you should have no problems with it falling over at all. I just wanted to let you know if you use it outdoors make sure you get yourself some larger heavier sandbags to use. I do really like it though."
"I‚Äôm a photographer who lives somewhere that experiences winter 9 months of the year. I needed a way to continue my business without the great outdoors on extremely cold days. This backdrop helped me so much with that! Easy to set up. Quality is okay. Sheet is fairly thin, think cheap bedsheet. Fairly stable and it comes with weighted bags to help support it if you feel it‚Äôs not sturdy enough. Here‚Äôs are some of my first shoots I did after purchasing. (Valentines minis)"
"easy to assemble, sturdy, and you can adjust the height and width. Simple and just what you need!!"
"Overall, a backdrop stand is a wise investment for anyone involved in photography or event planning. It combines functionality with ease of use, allowing both seasoned professionals and novices to elevate their projects. While it has minor stability issues outdoors, the benefits vastly outweigh this concern. I highly recommend adding a backdrop stand to your toolkit it's a game changer for creating stunning visual scenes. Whether for personal pleasure or professional service, you won't regret having this versatile piece of equipment on hand."
"Worked great- disassembled easily and comes with a storage bag, it was great for my purposes at a good price."
"I bought this backdrop stand to use as a stand for my projector to cut out patterns. While it holds the projector, and can support that weight, It is definitely not super sturdy without the sandbags. And unfortunately one of my sand bags has major holes in boths sides making it a major mess and difficult to repair. I'm using tape for now as I need to get to sewing. I would say the stitching on the bags leaves something to be desired. Hence my lower star review.  I'll update my review after I've used it a few times."
"I needed a way to show some large artwork and the Emart Photo Backdrop worked perfectly. Mind you, this was indoors. It came with sandbags (but no sand) that I yet have to test outdoors. It's not a heavy construction, which makes it light to carry, but it remains to be seen how it will fare outdoors. However, it was simple to assemble and looks professional. This product also comes with sandbags, but some other products don't, which is great. It also has some extra caps (to secure the cross bar) in case we lose the original ones. This product is worth it."
"After reading some of the Reviews I was hoping for the best, and although there were some that were slightly Negative, all of my thoughts on this are now Positive.I was actually pretty happy with just the one light after I set it up, but when I set up the other, I was more than happy!Here's what I found when I got them both going...REMOTE:  You CAN use ONE remote for both and they will STILL work independently of each other. So, one remote can make the opposite, make one gradually change from Low Brightness to High Brightness, and using that same remote you can then aim at the other and change that one from High Brightness to Low Brightness, if you wanted.So, the Brightness of each is controlled easily however you want to use them, On, off, color-shift, or brightness.The REMOTE is the cheapest made part in this set-up, it is VERY lightweight and it's very cheaply made, and very thin. I am only going to be using one at a time anyway, so if one breaks, I can use the other. Not just that, but they come with new bulbs, see more below.I had read that this was not the case, but, I tested it more than a few times, it does work. I do not know why some people said that it didn't.This is a BIGGY for me, I do product style photography and I placed an object on 'center stage' and watched as the shadows grew and shrank as I played with the remote's Brightness.Before I got this I had to use paper towels for a soft filter, I would also use the supplied light filters, but using them alone is usually not enough to get the amount of light one might need.(I am not referring to color filters, that is different)This is set-up as a professional lighting system, it just works!SET-UP:  It all went together REALLY easy, and FAST too!These are not the best made light stands etc., that there is out there, but they are made well, and there's not much to screw up on these, and if you did break something, I am pretty sure it can be fixed easily, or, there may be parts out there that would fit, these appear to me to be very standard/generic stands, and of course, the light socket is standard stuff.MATERIAL:  The soft box itself is made well enough, if you take care of it, there's no reason that you would need to replace it, there is no stretching of it when erecting the set-up, so no stress, no problems.The same goes for what they call the white ""nylon cover"", it creates a very soft shadow when used, and although you are 'supposed to' remove it when placing back into the bag, you don't necessarily have to, and if you did every time, I can't see where that will ever wear out either. It's made well enough and it should serve you for many years to come.STAND:  The stand itself is sturdy enough, I don't foresee any problems at all, moving it up and down doesn't make it wear really, so this also should last for many, many sessions.Tightening and loosening the knobs are the only place that I can see that could create a problem when used over and over, it is the only place that might wear throughout time. Again though, these should be standard replacement parts from reputable online or brick and mortar stores. These are not the best, but for what you pay, they are worth every bit of it.If one broke during a shoot, just use gaffers tape until you get a new part.LIGHT:  Now, for the light itself, that is where my confidence dwindles, not yet, I just received it, but that will more than likely be where your first problem will arise. I have zero knowledge of this type of bulb, although it accepts the standard sizes bulbs used in your home, the dimming and color-shift parts of the bulb is what sets it apart from the rest.These are not super expensive, but they aren't that cheap either. They are sold by themselves, or in pairs  on Amazon and elsewhere, so finding them is not hard, or, that expensive.I believe that when you buy a new bulb (from what I saw on Amazon) you will also get a new remote, so that would mean that to get all of the bulb's features, you will need to buy one either exactly the same, or a similar one that would have its own remote, by a different brand.You could use ANY light bulb in this if you had to, you can use the on-off (only) switch on the electrical cord between the lamp and the wall plug. That would just be for an emergency type scenario.Buy a back-up set of lights, that would be my suggestion.One more thing on the lamp itself, they are 'soft lamps', not harsh, which is good most of the time. If you do end up needing a harsher light, it will not be what you want. As it happens, only yesterday on my first try I found that I needed a more harsh shadow, so I ended up using my old smaller LED lights.I'm sure that somewhere there are some lamps that are harsh, but these are not them.DOUBTS:  I did have doubts, but as of now, I am extremely impressed with this set-up, and if it continues to work like it is now I am a really happy customers, of course, time is the big factor here, time will tell.Aside from that, buy this, and if it works like mine, you will not be sorry."
got this to do monthly milestone photos for my daughter. I have had no previous experience with lights like the but it was so so easy to set up and take down. the light is so bright and has a few color settings.
"The Orjim Softbox Photography Lighting Kit is a solid choice for anyone starting out in photography or looking for an affordable lighting solution. The 16” x 16” softboxes are lightweight, easy to set up, and provide nice, diffused lighting for portraits and product photography.My only wish is that they were a bit brighter for larger setups or when shooting in low-light conditions. That said, they work well for smaller projects and are a great value for the price. Overall, I’m happy with the purchase and would recommend it for light-duty photography needs."
It's worth to buy this product.  The light is bright and has different modes. I found its extremely useful for taking pictures and videos.  The price is not expensive comparing to its service.
"These lights are amazing, they make my skin look so good. I always get insecure of my skin on videos, but these are fantastic. So worth the money. Buy them !! I got the premium ones."
The lights are easy to set up and have different modes of operation.They work great and improves the picture quality.Would buy again
"I use these everytime i do a photoshoot! Really easy to setup and use. Super bright, adjustable. Just plain great ❤️"
"The light works okay, but when you want to release the canopy, it is very difficult.  I am mechanically inclined, but cannot see how to release it.  I was able to magically get one box to release, but cannot release the second one.  There are NO INSTRUCTIONS at all for this product."
"I had originally gone with a cheaper set from another seller but that set of lights had a really bad strong metal smell that was giving me a headache. So I returned them and went with these lights instead. Let me just say, no metal smell. (Thank goodness)Overall, these lights have been everything I needed. The hexagon shape from the light reflectors give a more natural ""lighting"" to your photos and videos. Bright and clear on camera, easy to set up, seems more durable that the last set I tried out. Only time will tell with the longevity of these lights but for the most part, it seems like they will last if you take care of them. Also, they come with a storage bag to put everything up nice and neat when your done!Absolutely perfect for anyone who's trying to get that ""perfect lighting setup"" without breaking the bank!"
"Ordered this product and it was delivered next day. East set up. Came with instruction manual. Everything is in working condition including bulbs. Light weight. The only small complaint I had was the stains on one of the head covers. Not visible when light is used. Still, this will get the job done for a quick shoot. Word of advise… get some sand bags to weigh down the stands."
Works good for the purpose I bought them.
