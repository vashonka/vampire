Arrived as described.  Good product.  I’d buy it again.
This larger sized game catches everyone’s attention and add a little extra fun to the game.  Chips and fabric are great quality.
The pieces and carpet itself are smaller than in the picture (pencil for reference). A bit of the thread started to become separated but with scissors it was fine. This is a fun item but for $25 it is not worth it.
"Combining dodgeball with a card game is a brilliant idea, and it’s a lot of fun to play with friends and family. The rules are easy to understand, and the game is highly engaging. Highly recommend for game nights."
Exploding kittens makes the best games! This one is super active and so much fun!
"Fun active game. Our children love the action of throwing the soft burritos. Even when thrown what would seem hard, still doesn't cause any physical discomfort. With adults its the same and you can make it a drinking game to add to the adult fun if you choose to. Great for family/friends game night."
"I didn’t know I’d be scrubbing blood out of the living room carpet on Christmas Day at 10:30p.m., but there I was, having to decide whether I pull out cleaning solution or if I just call it a night and go to bed. It’s all still a bit of a blur, but for proper context, allow me to start from the beginning.My teenage sister loves family board games, and Exploding Kittens is a favorite of hers. She’s mentioned a few times this year that she really, really wanted to try Throw Throw Burrito. Being the amazing older sister that I am, I added this to my Amazon cart and had it shipped to me to wrap for her to open Christmas morning. Did I do my research? No, this is where I made a grave mistake, but more on that later. When my sister tore the paper on Christmas morning to find this long-awaited game, thrilled shouts rang out around the room from fellow family members who looked forward to playing. The pride of a great gift given washed over me in this moment, and I took another sip of hot coffee, happy with the successful purchase. Looking back to that moment, I now see just how naive I was.After Christmas dinner had been eaten and the rest of dessert polished off, 6 of us gathered in the living room and sat down in a big circle on the floor to play Throw Throw Burrito. As I was reading the instructions, I grew concerned. Even though the name is “Throw Throw Burrito,” somehow I thought it would be more like “Toss Toss Burrito.” I swallowed my concern and we dealt everyone in. The game starts and we’re getting the hang of it and it’s a little aggressive...and then someone called a duel. I don’t remember who or how I ended up standing back-to-back with my younger brother who is a head taller and twice my size, but next thing I knew someone yelled “3...2...1... Burrito!” and I was no longer in the living room. Adrenaline surged through my veins and I was on a battlefield. I tried to dodge a burrito and chuck one all at the same time, and we both missed. Glass bulbs clanged on the Christmas tree, other players shouted from the sidelines, and I scrambled to find a burrito on the floor before my brother could get the other and hit me with it. Only thing is—I couldn’t find it. It was lost to me forever, so I had one option: run. I ran faster than I’ve ever run in my adult life as this grown, built-like-bull beast of a man chased me around the living room, nearly causing an earthquake to rupture across the American Midwest. I had nowhere to turn but to keep running around the room before he could hit me. This is where things start to get fuzzy, because my heart is racing and I’m running for my EVER. LOVING. LIFE. Suddenly, my foot slides against a game card and I fly, falling face-down into the carpet. I lie there for a second trying to process all that just transpired when I feel the harrowing finality of a burrito hitting me in the back. The competitive screams turn to silence, and someone says, “Uh, you ok?”I carefully pick myself—and my pride—up off the floor. We all make our way back into the circle, the game we once played long gone, scattered in a disarray across the room. Some announced how this was the most fun they’d ever had during a card game, and still reconciling in my mind what just occurred, I let them know that no one could ever convince me to play this awful game again.My sister rolled her eyes and we straightened the cards best we could to get back to the round at hand. I feel my foot throbbing and I look down, only to see blood running down the side of it. I’m not sure at what point I was injured during my burrito civil war, but there was a gash on my foot. “I’m bleeding!” I exclaim, and my fellow players just start laughing. We finished the game around 10:30 in the evening, and I left to properly bandage my foot. I come back and as we’re putting the game away I see a blood stain in the white carpet where I had fallen just minutes prior. The big question now was, do I scrub the blood out of my mother’s white carpet, or just call it a night? Who knew this is how the Christmas of 2020 would draw to a close?All that being said, buyer beware: this is no game of “Toss Toss Burrito.” This, indeed, is “Throw Throw Burrito,” and may bring out a new side you’ve never seen before of the people you play with. And, bad mood and wounded pride aside, it was actually pretty fun. We played it again last night and while bulbs clanged against the Christmas tree again, no one was majorly injured. The burritos are already cracked and one is missing a chunk, so I don’t think they’ll last very long, but Throw Throw Burrito is quite the entertaining game nonetheless.All I can say now, fellow potential purchaser, is good luck."
Very fun and chaotic for the whole family.
Really nothing wrong with a game that involves dueling burritos. Just fun and easy to understand.
"The game is fun, it is fast-paced, and it was a really good therapy tool for my kid with selective mutism as it encourages verbal interaction in a fun setting. Younger kids can play alongside older kids and adults. Great game!"
"We're hosting an extended family game night next week and I wanted something new & different to play that everyone would enjoy. Our family loves rummy, PIT! and other card games so I figured I'd give 'Throw Throw Burrito' a try, even though we've never played or purchased 'Exploding Kittens' or any other of their games. And also even though someone in my family tends to injure themselves every single time we all get together.Yesterday when this arrived, my husband and I sat down to learn how to play so that we can teach everyone else on game night. It is easy to learn and appropriate for all ages. It was great fun playing this, even with just two people, and it'd be a lot more fun with a bigger group.So I matched the 'Burrito War' cards which means everyone grabs for a burrito and throw it at another player. I whipped a burrito at my husband's chest except it accidentally hit him in the face because 1) I have terrible (or great?) aim and 2) we were sitting at very close range to each other.Consequently, he informed me that 'we' are not allowed to play this game anymore. When he said 'we' I knew he meant me. I am not allowed to play because I cannot be trusted to not hit him in the face with a squishy burrito. He hid the box but I know where and I am totally breaking this out on family game night!"
"My son is 9 and this is the game he always wants to play on game night.  It's an easy game to learn and lots of kids/people can play at the same time.  Only thing is, play somewhere where you won't be afraid something may be knocked over by a flying burrito!  Good game for birthday parties too."
"This is basically the card game Spoons, but more extravagant and crazy and we love it! Takes a while to inflate and deflate and the burritos are pretty big, but we'll worth it! Easy for young children to learn and play."
This was a housewarming gift and will bring hours of fun! Good quality and an easy fit for its carrying case.
"The blocks are a nice size, very smooth and lightweight. Love the bag, dice and score board that were included. Not disappointed."
"The oversized blocks make it more fun than the original game, but it still fits on a table. The blocks easily fit back in the package for easy portability. We take it camping and itâ€™s always a hit for those around us."
"We had a great time with this, hours of entertainment"
Not sure what the dice is for but they are made well and fun for parties.
"I was looking for an outdoor ""Jenga"" style block tower that was good for family fun with kids. This is a fun set and priced well.Background: We already have the small indoor Jenga that my kids love but with it being summer and us wanting to spend more time outdoors, I wanted to get a larger set. I first started looking at the Jenga GIANT but couldn't believe how expensive they were, then found similar listings and settled on the Megwoz Giant Tumbler Tower.How big is it: It is comparable in size to the Jenga GIANT but about 1/3rd the price. It's about 2 feet tall when set up, reaches up to 4 feet tall depending on how good you are. If you want to expand the set, you can buy another set as it doesn't look like they sell an expansion kit.How durable is it: One difference to Jenga GIANT is the wood type. Jenga GIANT is made of a more durable hardwood while this set is made of pine wood. However, I've got other outdoor pine wood games like a Kubb game that holds up to more abuse, so pine wood will hold up fine for a low impact tower tumble game.My wife and I play with our 6 year olds and they have a blast. I recommend finding a crate or small table that you can set up so it's about 1-2 feet off the ground (especially for the adults who can't bend as low as kids). You'll thank me after bending and squatting down over and over. Easily hours of fun for adults, kids or mixed.Setup is easy, stack and play. They include a pair of dice in case you want to change it up and make it more challenging. Instead of stacking one at a time, you have to stack the number you roll.When putting them away, the bag is a snug but will fit everything, so here's a tip. Put down 10 pieces per row, you will have to line them up so the short width is facing down (you won't be able to fit 10 per row and will run out of room if you place any other side down). See one of my pics of it packed away for an example. They'll be a little bit of room on the top row, so don't panic and think you're missing something. There's 56 pieces to stack up, which is 19 rows (18 rows of 3 across and a bottom row with 2 pieces apart)."
I bought this to use for a work event and it was perfect! Well made and love the carrying case!
"These looked huge in the pictures, so we got them. They were much smaller than we thought. BUT they were the stated size in the descriptions so still 5 stars. Most of the ones sold on Amazon are between 6"" and 7"" long. See if you can find ones that are >12"" long. We played with this truly giant logs at a campsite once, and it's been nearly impossible to find them."
Canâ€™t go wrong with this game. So much fun for all bought for a company event. Everyone had a blast playing it.
Product is fun and perfect
"Good product you couldnâ€™t build it for this price itâ€™s a fun activity for families, groups and even at work"
Bought for our Christmas entertainment gift for a family gathering.
"Great size, comes with a case, very secure"
"9 year old and 5 year old both use this MULTIPLE times a day! Santa hit a home run! (Still toys unopened in favor of this.)1 arrow did break, but was easily glued. Clean break, no shattered pieces.One bow has half working lights, but 9 doesn't like them anyway."
Great set especially for the price. Targets not real tall but great for kids.
"It was fun getting it set up and playing, love that it lights up and the light nerf guns with suction cup bullets. However its starting to break, we had it a little bit before Christmas. Like the little piece that helps guide the arrow broke off, the arm to the bow wont fold close anymore."
I got these for my nephews and godson and they were a major hit this holiday!! GREAT QUALITY and super easy to set up and store! One of my better finds/ buys!
"This was a gift for my grandson, when he open it he was so happy. This is a great gift to give any boy. Even his Mom started playing with him."
Okay product. Not the best quality and breaks easy. That being said kids loved it . Colors are as they look in pictures
"Gave this to my boyfriends nephew and he loved it, it’s a great set for the price"
Son-in-Law and Grandson is loving this. It comes with 2 bows and 2 foam darts guns and a target. Easy set-up and hours of fun for 1 or 2 people.
"Grandchildren love it, works well, pretty good quality."
"3 out of the 20 bullets wouldn’t stick to the target board at all.2 out of the 20 arrows have very weak suction to the board.The target was easy to assemble.The guns were not very easy for kids to load without touching the suction cup, but it’s doable.Bows are not too tight or too lose, give enough force to shoot but not difficult for kids to use.Overall, it’s very fun for the kids and also us adults too.Good toys of toy quality."
Love the game and how it was tweaked to match the giant size. There’s only 3 pieces instead of four. It definitely does not affect the fun. Probably makes it quicker to win to play more games. It’s plastic so it’s easy to clean. And won’t hurt it if it gets wet. The pieces are not the quickest to put together but are sturdy and lightweight.Overall I am very happy with the money I spent.
Great game! So easy to play
I purchased these for our two granddaughters. They are very cool. The pieces are oversized and detailed. They granddaughters were very excited.
"Overall, this is very fun! It is pretty easy to set up basically you lay the blanket part flat on your floor and snap together the large game pieces. For people that are used to playing the original board game, this one is slightly different. There are three pieces for each player instead of four. There are also a few differences between the rules and gameplay. However, you can always institute house rules and play it just like you do the board game. This is what we usually do so my pre-schooler don't have to try to figure out the differences between the two games.  My elementary-aged kid loves the different shortcut rules on this game board!Since the board is so large, it provides a little bit more movement since often you have to get up to walk around to the other side of the board to move pieces. This is a definite plus for children with a lot of energy!The sturdiness of this is quite questionable, which is a little disappointing considering that this is a child's game. The map part which is the game board is pretty thin and puckers pretty easily if children were to crawl a cross it often it could easily tear or rip.  A minus for children with a lot of energy.  It's thinner than a typical reusable tablecloth. However, it's thicker than the ones you get at a dollar store. I am very nervous when my dog tries to walk across it, Which if we were to play in the middle of the living room floor often cannot be avoided. We have rug on our floor which means the surface underneath it is not solid which would make it even easier for holes to be punctured or dog nails to go through it. I wish the game board was a little more sturdy. Also, when I was putting together the pieces, it was hard to get a few of the pieces to snap completely together. This left us small gap at the top of each game piece. We were still able to use each; however, it did detract from the overall quality.Overall, I""m happy and this provides some family fun that gives us a bit more movement than a table top game.  I wish the quality was higher."
My 5 and 8 year old sons loves playing this game. Seems like they loved it more than the original board game because this one is more interactive.. so instead of sitting around a game they’re actually able to stand up and move around. I would definitely recommend this!!
"I love monopoly! I bought the giant game edition because I wanted the 4 giant token pieces (car, hat, shoe and dog) for scavenger hunt purposes. I am on a conference committee and the destination for the annual conference was Atlantic City, NJ.  What better game to play then monopoly.  I was able to make poster size property pieces and incorporate the 4 giant token pieces around the conference center. We created monopoly trivia questions that sent attendees on a scavenger hunt to find the property, utility or token piece.  It went over well, mission accomplished."
"This was ordered because we loved playing the original Sorry game back in the day. It looks just like the original game, only much larger. The plastic game ""board"" is more like a thick plastic sheet you put on the floor and ready to use. The spinner is easily popped together. Now for the game pieces.... UGHHHH! The game pieces are a great size, easy to grab and move. Unfortunately they don't come assembled and where it seems it should be easy to pop 2 pieces of plastic together per pawn, the plastic is warped and holes don't align and they literally took forever to put together, over half hr just to pop these together. The whole game is brightly colored and a fun idea, but the game pieces need better construction and durability. Fun for people of all ages and not a bad price point."
Awesome for outdoor functions!! Great value for the money!! Very easy to learn and play!! Kids absolutely love it!!
"The game is large, the kids were a little cramped if they ended up beside each other but the gameplay is fun. Was about 20 minutes total."
The parts were difficult to put together but once done all was fine
We had a blast playing this during the summer break. It is fun for ages 6 and up.
"The Original The Floor is Lava! Game by Endless Games is a hit with both kids and adults! It’s interactive, energetic, and encourages creativity as players jump from tile to tile to avoid the “lava.” The setup is simple, and it’s perfect for family game nights, parties, or just a fun activity to get everyone moving.The game promotes teamwork, coordination, and a lot of laughter. The tiles are sturdy and vibrant, making them easy to use and durable for repeated play. Whether for indoors or outdoors, this game is an absolute blast. Highly recommend for hours of fun and excitement!"
This game is perfect for kids! Any age kid honestly! My daughter loves playing with her friends!!!
While game was in effect one of players little 2-3 years old brother  joined in the fun- uninvited and happily 95.5% of the stepped on the correct colors. Total fun!!
"While the game itself seems very fun for a 6 year old, the stepping pieces aren't big enough for larger feet and they are a very flimsy flannel.  I'm not sure how to make them stronger because laminating would make them too slippery?  It seems like the game should just have pieces make of sturdier thicker flannel that is larger."
"My daughter is obsessed with “the floor is lava” and I had no idea they actually made a game for it. Love it, would recommend"
"The game looked like it had been returned, nothing in bags and one of the cards was missing.  My grandson loved the game so I didn’t want to take from him to return it. Loved the game but a little disappointed that it did not appear new."
"I was impressed with how quickly the game I bought for my daughter's birthday was delivered! It arrived sooner than expected, in perfect condition, and made her very happy on her special day. The speed of delivery made all the difference. Very satisfied with the shopping experience!"
Lovely game for Christmas

I knew the moment I saw my buddy pull this game out at a cookout that I would love it, and I was not disappointed when I actually got to play. I love ping pong and other non-traditional games so this fit perfectly into my lane.I appreciate that it is a self-contained game, as well. The paddles, balls and even the net fit inside the board so that it is super portable. I will now take this with us if I even think anyone will be willing to play.We took this to a local lake beach and had everyone (not exaggerating) asking us about what this game was. We even had some other attendees ask if they could play while me and my friends were taking a break. This game is such a good ice breaker at outdoor events. It gives the people that don't want to play something to watch\talk about too! We have a church event coming up and I can't wait to bring Paddlesmash out and get people playing.Our friend group is starting to introduce our kids into the mix by pairing them with an adult partner. We have 8 year olds and up getting started and it's only making the game more approachable. The biggest hurdle for the kids is paddle control and net awareness. They see us playing at a higher level and really want to get in on the action.Paddlesmash has a lifetime warranty that can be activated as soon as you open it up, and it's super easy to do. The paddles are pretty sturdy, but they can break if you play as extremely as we do. This is easily overcome by the warranty.I'm hooked on this game for life. My only problem now is finding people that want to play as much as I do!"
Really fun game... easy to play and you can do it in a small space... Highly recommend!

Paddle Smash…thank you.. you’ve done it.. I have been searching my whole life for a game this fun and I don’t even play pickle ball.1st The design is amazing.  Easy 1 minute setup and everything fits inside the compact hardshell case.  Even if you only have time to play 1 game.. the quick set up is worth it!!2nd The game is so much fun!  The paddles give you more reach and the net prevents dirty low hits making it 100x better than spikeball. It’s the perfect balance of skill and hustle.  Once you get the hang of it you can make some awesome saves and spikes that get the people going!!3rd Value.  Only $200 for this much fun and lifetime warranty is worth every penny.  You might struggle to buy 4 really good pickle ball paddles for under 200$.4th customer support.  When I broke a paddle after playing hard for weeks I sent one email and they sent a new one right away no questions asked (other than my shipping address lol).  Their customer support is responsive and very top notch!If you’re on the edge just buy it!  You won’t regret it and it may change your life.  I get invited to everything now because I have paddle smash! It always stays in the truck."
"this is such a fun game. my family loves it! it is easy to take places, because of the case it comes in. the way it folds up is so clever! i recommend this!!!"
"I was hesitant at first to spend almost $200 on a ""toy"" to take to the beach for my family - ranging in age from 14 to 68 years old.  I considered it for a week or so before deciding to take a chance and order it.  I'm so glad that I did.  Please take the instructions to heart - it WILL take around 10 to 15 minutes before you will get the hang of how it works, but once you do - it's so much fun!  My first reaction when it arrived was how heavy it was - sturdy for sure.  It sets up quickly and easily.  Then - just be patient with yourself and keep practicing - don't give up until you've given it at least 30 minutes to sink in.  My kids are grown with older kids of their own, and when we left the beach, both my son and daughter wanted to take it home with them.  My daughter ended up with it, but decided her brother should also have one, so she had one sent to him!  I think that says a lot about how much fun and interaction you can have with this set.  It really isn't a toy - it's extremely well made and durable.  My family recommends it and now we can't wait to take it back to the beach next year - I can already imagine how tough the competition is going to be with them having an entire year to practice!  If you're on the fence - go for it!"
Super fun game and easy to travel with! It takes some practice so you have to be willing to be patient and get the hang of it but we’re enjoying it.
This game is not family friendly.  We are all huge pickleball players and none of us could play this game.We tried to play with some 12 yr olds who play many other sports and they couldn’t play it either.The paddles are cheap and one was chipped. You have to watch a video for instructions on how to play only the video is really just an advertisement and very confusing.  We returned this game.

I debated a long time over this purchase. I have been on a hunt for an active game that my four kids (ages 10-15, with 3 boys and only 1 girl) could play and would enjoy enough to keep at it to get truly good. I have tried so many outdoor/basement games and the boys usually enjoy them but the girl never gets hooked and this breaks up the four players needed (spikeball, fooseball, air hockey, cross net etc). I finally gave this a try as it seemed like something even I would actually enjoy playing with my kids as well. (And there are 2 and 3 player versions so you don’t HAVE to have four players always). We have had the game 1.5 weeks and already they have spent endless hours playing this! I couldn’t be more thrilled!It took us longer than 5 min to get the hang of it (and I honestly questioned my decision to get this game after the first evening that we tried it). But everyone was quite motivated to stick with it. And it did begin to click just like they promised. And then it just becomes addicting!We have only played this in our basement so far, as it has been super hot outside. But I can’t wait for cooler weather as I think it will be even more fun outside! Though honestly, it has been great getting the hang of it inside.I am so glad that I took a chance on this game and that I didn’t let the price tag stop me. It seems very well made. And I love how portable it is! Five stars!"
Well made!  So much fun!  Highly recommend!
"Lots of fun for four or even two players. Think of bump, set, spike! Net, base, and paddles are all high quality. We've got three teenage boys. This is our new favorite game!"
Terrific fun and very entertaining.  Not as easy as it looks - needs practice but well worth it. Stores nicely.
I do like this game but this product was questionable because the piping for the stand shows signs of stress each and every time we set it up or change the game. I did see one that was $40 more I feel like I should have got it because the stand was made of metal this was low grade plastic but the appearance was very attractive for the kids it was easy to set up but I don't expect this to last more than a few months. Value for money was okay
The axes stick nicely and it is very sturdy
This is really awesome but unfortunately the connectors came broken. They are not a more pliable plastic and  it could have been prevented had it been packaged into another box with some bubbles.
"It looks great, and set up was easy and fun. However make sure you have a bag or plastic tote to keep it in while not in use. It came with a bag for the darts and axes, but nothing for the target, and the cardboard box it came in will not do the trick."
