"I'm really pleased with this 2-pack of headlamps. They are surprisingly bright and provide excellent visibility in the dark. Whether I'm hiking, camping, or working around the house at night, these headlamps illuminate the area well. The light is clear and adjustable, allowing me to focus it exactly where I need it. They are also comfortable to wear; the headbands are adjustable and don't feel too tight or uncomfortable after extended use. The design is straightforward and easy to operate, with simple buttons for switching between light modes. I appreciate that they come in a pack of two, which is convenient for keeping one as a spare or sharing with a friend or family member. The battery life is decent, lasting several hours on a single set of batteries. Overall, these headlamps exceed my expectations for their brightness and comfort, making them a great value for anyone needing reliable hands-free lighting."
This light is a lifesaver at night time. The light is bright and super functional with all its options. The battery lasts a long time before needing to be charged.
"The white light is great. Comfortable to wear and plenty bright, seems easy enough to use. Didn't push it on battery life yet, but seems worthwhile.I was excited for the red light while camping, though, and that turned out to be a disappointment. A friend had a headlamp with a red beam that clearly illuminated a patch three meters out, which is plenty to see the ground while walking from tents to bathroom. This one either lost focus or just wasn't bright enough even 2 meters out, so really couldn't use it for walking around in the dark at all. This was the same for both lights, which was disappointing. Wish they'd chosen a brighter LED."
works well get 2 for the price of 1
"Not the brightest, but good enough for around camp or to throw in your pack in case you need it."
The light doesn't tilt/adjust.Lightweight. Elastic adjusts well.
I got these for my kids & I to go on night hikes outdoors. They work great! We usually hike btwn 1-3 hours & these remain bright for the entire time. I‚Äôm glad I purchased them!
"Purchased these for gifts for the hunters in our family. These are powerful, bright, easy to adjust and operate! It‚Äôs a valued ‚ÄúSafety‚Äù gift for a hunter walking through the woods at dusk or night."
"Cheap feeling but it does what it is supposed to. So, 5 stars in my opinion."
Doesn't flex/rotate head but ok as backups/spares
2 pcs in one bulk pack without battries
"I wanted my middle school students to get a feel for what it was like to start a fire without modern tools, and this was a great tool for them to use. The success rate was about 20-30% (it was a moist day), but all the groups had a lot of fun, have a tactile memory of the effort required, and practiced team work in doing this. I will order again for next year."
This item COMES ASSEMBLED!  I found the You Tube video reference really helpful.  It is exactly as advertised.  I am thoroughly satisfied.  What super fun!
"This is a bow and drill for starting a fire, so of course it is going to suck. I find these sorts of kids incredibly difficult for getting an amber, but I needed this to practice for a competition that had a fire-starting component"
Learning to make fire need patience but worth it
"I understand the concept, I bought this for my son to learn and mess with different methods of fire making. This! Kit is guud‚Äö√Ñ√π but lacks clear instruction if you didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t already understand the concept of the bow drill I can see it being hard to mess with"
After a little trial and error my son and I got in a rhythm and started a fire! It was really cool!
"I got a couple of these to introduce my young sons (ages 5 and 7) to the concept of friction fire.  I really like that the bow is attached to the spindle, so it removes the frustration of having the spindle fly away from the bow like a regular bow drill.  I think this is a great teaching tool for those unfamiliar with friction fire as it eases the learning process, especially for younger users.  We got to practice our form, and learn the concept, which was the goal.  While they weren't able to get an ember during their first attempts they did learn some things, and most importantly, they didn't get frustrated and had FUN!  We will continue to refine our techniques with this kit until they are able to get an ember and start a fire, and then we will progress to a regular field crafted kit.  Overall, I think this is great way to teach newcomers, and it is also a great way to share and spend time with your kids."
"I ordered this to see how good of a product it was. This was sent in a very timely manner and arrived very quickly, with great packaging. It was very easy to use with the spindle on top of the handle which eliminates the need for a rock or harder piece of wood on top. The paracord around it makes it easier to spin fast, which inturn uses less energy to make an ember. It takes less than a few minutes to get the fire started even for a novice or beginner. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s designed in a way, and easy enough for a child to use properly. Will be purchasing again, and would recommended to anyone."
"I picked up this survival shovel mainly to keep in my truck for emergencies, but it‚Äôs already proving to be useful around the house for small projects. The compact design makes it easy to store, and the blade is tough enough to handle digging through dirt, mud, and even snow.The pick feature is a nice touch when I need to break through tougher ground. It folds down easily and comes with a handy carrying case, making it perfect for camping or off-road trips.Some people said it's too heavy for a backpack, but I'd disagree.Pros:- Compact and easy to store under my back seat- Sturdy steel construction- Includes a pick for tougher tasks / breaking up soil- Comes with a carrying case that seems robustCons:- A bit small for larger projects"
This is a great emergency shovel to have in both your bug out bag üéí and the trunk of your car üöó. This shovel also has a few other hidden tools inside the handles that can come in handy üòâ and it comes apart at the handles for compact storage. Seems to be just the right size to handle anything from mud and dirt to snow as well as cutting and sawing. This is a great survival multi tool. Thanks Rhino USA. I love it.  Tony H.
I originally purchased this for a snowmobile trip but this little shovel has proved itself useful many times over the past year. It packs compact and is light enough to throw in a backpack. This is one of those items that you will use more than you realize. Would recommend this to others.
"It's fine as a light use camp shovel. It folds and unfolds okay. I haven't used it for anything other than digging up difficult to remove tent stakes or covering and separating campfire coals and light digging at campsite. I agree with the customers who are disappointed that it's not made in the USA and think the advertising is deceiving, but I already knew that before I bought it because I actually read the reviews beforehand. It would probably cost at least twice the Amazon price to be made in the USA these inflated days so I understand why it's not. I purchased it in hopes that it would last for my intended use and because the company appears to care enough to donate to reputable charities. I'm not sure how much of the purchase goes to charity, but that's okay since I was purchasing a product, not donating to the charities. So far I'm satisfied with the quality of the product and will update if that changes."
"Wow! Really nice well versed camping/survival tool. Sharp edges, sturdy extension pcs. The cool hidden gadgets is an extra OO7 feature haha. Definitely worth the price. This for sure is everything and more than I expected."
"I bought this because I needed a small shovel to scoop dog poo but I feel a lil bad cause this is a nice hand shovel. Good materials, easy to figure out, comes with a warranty and a bag (which I won‚Äôt use for a poo shovel but I‚Äôm keeping it anyway cause it‚Äôs a nice nylon storage bag).Whoever said in reviews that the advert was deceptive re: made in the USA, I beg to differ. Unless something says those words, assume it‚Äôs not. This company was extremely blunt and considering it doesn‚Äôt cost $50, wherever /whoever made it did a fine job.I think I‚Äôll get the fancier multitool one for my outdoorsy brother. He‚Äôd love it and he‚Äôs a snob for quality. 10/10 would shovel poo with again"
"I‚Äôm digging in my basement crawl space in a confined area. It‚Äôs rugged, yet light. I got the straight handle so I can jab into clay soil and roots then pry up with it. I‚Äôm amazed how strong it is. Love the cover so I can throw it in the back of my seat in my truck. Must be made of some type of aircraft aluminum, I don‚Äôt know, but the blade is thick. Better than the one I humped all over the deserts. Be a great gift for a son, or daughter‚Ä¶"
"This small but heavy duty, what we used to call, an Army Shovel, came in very handy and much needed to dig the ground underneath my mobile home. I was getting sewer stoppages for a long time and the quotes to fix my sewer pipe under there was astronomical. With my new, handi-dandi army shovel, I was able to dig it up, under there, and do the repair myself, for a FRACTION of the price. No other shovel I had could do the job. Even cutting the handle down short couldn‚Äôt get it. With the army shovel you can change the angle of the shovel in close quarters. And it has a small pick (ground-scratcher) as well, making it easier to break up the hard ground for easier dirt removal.I highly recommend this JEWEL for jobs such as mine, and would also be very handy to have available on camping trips and such. And the price is reasonable!"
Bought this to carry in an emergency bag I keep in my truck. Folds into a compact size but when assembled seems to be a well built sturdy shovel.
Perfect fit in  small bag but can go up 3 feet sturdy and light
I got this for my husband as a stocking stuff since he‚Äôs always going hunting or adventure seeking. It‚Äôs compact and can fit in any backpack or vehicle. It has so many great items and enough space to add a few more things if you want more variety. It‚Äôs definitely a must buy if you go off roading or hiking often.
"Wow, this has everything.  I love it. I'm keeping it in my car for emergencies."
Got it for my son for Christmas on sale for $25! It‚Äôs very cool I think he will love it!
Jam packed full of the essentials. Thought it would be bigger but it gets the job done
All the supplies shown where in the bag ! Definitely good for traveling
"This kit is exactly as portrayed by the Amazon listing.  In fact, I used the listing to aid me in identifying some of the items.As I live in Colorado, I primarily bought this to keep in the SUV, just in case.  When travelling in the mountains, it is surprisingly easy for a routine drive to become a survival situation.  This kit will help out immensely in that situation."
"This item was purchased as a GIFT, and the recipient absolutely LOVED it!!! Thanx for this opportunity!!!"
"The running vest is an excellent choice for any avid runner. It offers a fantastic fit that conforms comfortably to your body, minimizing any bounce or chafing during your runs. The storage options are impressive, with multiple pockets and compartments that securely hold essentials like your phone, energy gels, and keys, without adding bulk. Additionally, the vest is remarkably lightweight, making it easy to wear without feeling cumbersome. Overall, it‚Äôs a top-notch piece of gear that combines functionality with comfort."
"I'm 66 years old and had Neck Microfracture surgery so some chest or fanny pack bags cause me neck pain.This bag is comfortable and allows me to carry more gear. It's also ""lefty"" friendly.I have tried different firearms in it and they all fit great. I even tried a Government model 1911(5 inch barrel) that's pretty darn heavy. The 1911 is more comfortable in this chest pack than it is carrying it on my hip.This pack seems well made and a good value for the price. I'm seriously considering buying another to have for a spare."
"I bought this to start running and I love it. It‚Äôs great quality, looks fantastic, super stable when running. The elastic back straps keep it close to chest so it‚Äôs not bouncing a whole lot. It fits great out of the package but it‚Äôs also adjustable. Overall worth the money spent."
Got this for a gift and he likes it ! The size is good! The stretch is good and very handy ‚Ä¶ the storage room on it is great!
It‚Äôs very cozy it‚Äôs something small so it won‚Äôt take up room it‚Äôs light weight and has many adjustments so you can fit it to your body type and looks cool while using and can fit with many outfits overall happy with my purchase
"I like this product and would highly recommend it to those who hike, run, and/or use a CCW.The backing to the front is comfortable and has a soft comfortable backing to it. It‚Äôs mesh and has some lining on the side that I thought would irritate but it‚Äôs not an issue. This makes it user friendly when doing different activities.The zippers are good. There‚Äôs a waterproof pouch that you can store things that would otherwise function if not submerged or covered in water.The bigger pocket allows a strap and for a CCW. There‚Äôs even a convenient strap for quick draw.The front again has some capacity for other pieces of furniture that you want like a clip on mag light or something. The flag patch is removable.The back has a mesh pocket that‚Äôs see through. And the straps and buckles are pretty good as far as fit and appearance. It‚Äôs hardly noticeable wearing this thing. The value for the money is great and again I highly recommend this product. Can‚Äôt wait to see what they might update on it or other colors."
"Positives: This chest pack holds my wallet, phone, keys and all my other EDC items along with a full sized carry pistol. Its pockets and slots hold everything securely, and with little to no movement inside. The hardware works as intended and with no issues with the zippers or the side clips.Negatives: I use this chest pack for running and walking outdoors, and with only a few months of moderate use, the right side,  shoulder strap is starting to tear at the seam between the elastic material and nylon strap, with the stitching coming undone also, as shown in the picture with Red arrows.The clasps for the shoulder strap loosen and need readjustment every so often, also I have the shoulder straps tightened as far I could possibly could, and still can‚Äôt manage get the shoulder straps at the right adjustment so the chest pack isn‚Äôt sagging nor loose and flopping around while running, although I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a personable problem or product flaw yet."
"It is easy to adjust the straps to fit over what it needs to. Fits over my jacket, but I don't tighten it too much when I do. Holds quite a bit of stuff, without to holster being used. I think it is comfortable, and the fabric is soft."
"Awesome compact design that allows for a quick split on some kindling.  I've owned and used this for the past year and so far the blade has held strong and sharp. The edge seems to hold, but I am also only chopping small soft wood like pines. The small size allows for a quick swing. For the price and brand name this is hard to beat great value and addition to my camping bag"
"I purchased one of these used for around $25. Came with a few dings on the handle but hey it‚Äôs a tool doesn‚Äôt bother me. Great addition to my bug out bag, thin, lightweight, compact and definitely sharp. Even for the normal sale price I‚Äôd call it a good value."
This is good got backpacking and lightweight
"I‚Äôm making a get home bag to leave in the car. Since stuff might get stolen, I‚Äôm not leaving real good expensive stuff in the bag. I have better hatchets. Much better. This guy will suffice for any short term emergency and eliminates the need for any good knife in the bag. This hatchet and a mora will do the trick.This is a relatively thin stamped steel. Full tang, adequate grip. Baton small branches and twigs for tinder.Good sheath with belt loops. Not too heavy for a backpack. Good choice for a limited purpose.Also good for a new scout."
"Right size, Comfortable, Very sturdy. I like Gerber stuff."
"Light, sturdy and sharp. Great for your pack so you can break down wood for kindling and such."
This is a remarkable hatchet. Gerber always delivers. Would highly recommend for camping or your bug out bag.
Gray productos Greate quality 100%
Great product for my newest hobby where I needed a handy sized and lighter axe for my woodworking projects and the nice little safety cover is great for taking it in my backpack when I am out in the woods
I bought it for my husband. He likes to use them during cold weather. It is not too hot and warm with a perfect temperature. Rechargeable batteries is much convenient. The size is perfect to carry anywhere.

I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve gone through  a lot of different gloves, mitts, and combinations over the years and still needed to use those disposable hand warmers which weren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t that warm. These will eliminate the need for those!I like that they have 3 settings, the battery life has been great so far (I used them on medium heat on two hunts for a total of 5 hrs and still had some charge left) I like that they snap together so it will be harder to misplace (as I tend to do). They are compact enough to fit in my mittens. But work best in a pocket where you can curl your hand around them as the heat is only on one side unless you snap together for 360 degree heat.What I like a little less is the thickness of them (but I supposed it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s what is needs to be to maintain the charge for so long)I also wish they were pliable- they are hard plastic and the heated side is curved to fit in your palm so it may become a pain to use in ski gloves while using poles. I like to keep a warmer in my glommit top over my fingers so I as not to impede my grip on my firearm or access the trigger.But overall I like the reliable heat these provide and the money I will save on the disposable warmers.Great value!"
These work great on a cold day.  I keep them in my pocket and turn them when I get cold.
".  It's nice that if your hands are freezing, you can use a higher setting, and once they've warmed up, the setting can be lowered.  Anything but the lowest setting gets too hot, but they lasted a good while and provided comfort."
"A great item to have in my pockets when I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m fishing in the winter time, very easy to use and long lasting"
I cannot handle the cold and this has saved my ‚Äö√Ñ√∫always freezing‚Äö√Ñ√π hands. I can keep them in my jacket pockets and I can get through the winters a little easier knowing they are warm and reliable.
"I ordered these ( 2 pair ) Wednesday mid morning and received them Thursday mid morning. Charged them up and used them for the first time last night at My Oldest Grandson's High School  Rugby  Match here in Nc. It was 38 ¬¨‚àû with a feel like temp of 33¬¨‚àû . These hot little suckers worked GREAT ‚Äö√Ñ¬∫√î‚àè√® I Let my Youngest son and youngest grandson use a pair and they loved them as well. No more disposable hand warmers for this family  .They heat up FAST, fit perfectly in my hands and are also cool looking as well.. I've just used them the one time and for the price,  I can say I'm ECSTATIC about this product so far...we have 4 grandchildren that play Football, Baseball, Rugby and soccer,  so will use them often. I'll also use them when I'm out fishing on cold days.. Go ahead and buy a pair or two, you WON'T  be disappointed ‚Äö√Ñ¬∫√î‚àè√®Ô£ø√º√¥√á"
"I'm a ski instructor and my hands get extremely cold. I was flying through the one use hand warmers. I also didn't like how much waste I was creating with the one use ones. These warmers are absolutely amazing! They get very hot. I only ever had them turned on to the lowest setting. They last a long time and are super easy to charge. As soon as you hit that on button, you can start feeling them warm up. Love how hot they get and how fast they warm up. I absolutely recommend!"
This unit does not have a solar panel like the lawn lights that get cloudy and quit working after awhile. Thus is a high quality.material. By virtue of the enclosed battery the unit has some good heft to it.Cordless charging is fast. It can be charged prior to camping or an approaching storm just like you would any device. It comes with a USB-C charging cord. When the power is out or you are camping the solar charger works great. High quality unit at this price.
"I went with the larger capacity as I use it for backpacking. It fully charges my phone several times on a 3-4 day trip. The flashlight is also very bright and works well. Solar capability is not any better than any other charging system, but it still works well enough. I'm not really a fan of the built in cables, but I just pack my own and plug it into the side. Easy enough"
"Purchased two power banks for use while touring Europe this fall, and we were very impressed with the performance of the power banks.  What was surprising about this product was how well it stood up every day in keeping our phones fully charged, we never ran out of power.  We were using our phones constantly throughout the day and night while touring, geocaching and taking thousands of photos.  The power bank comes with the 4 built-in cables, but we never used them, instead we opted for 3- and 6-foot fast charging Type C cords that ran from our backpacks to our phones while moving.  We also liked the wireless charger, which had no problem charging our S24 Ultras with Armor Box covers.  The only drawbacks if any, the power bank is very heavy and a bit bulky and does exceed the approved TSA battery capacity limit, but we had no problem going through TSA security checks."
"It still works great! Like most solar chargers though it takes a few hours to fully charge when using direct sunlight. I brought mine on my trip to Turkey for a week. I used it to charge my phone the entire week I was there. I believe in the description it says it can charge a phone up to 8 times, but mine only charged it about three times all the way, which worked for me perfectly. I plugged it in to recharge the solar charger every night though. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s slightly heavy lol but I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m ok with it. I LOVE all the adapters and stuff it has. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s so easy to use. It has a nice feel to it as well. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s also pretty tough. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve dropped it a couple times and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s withstood the potential damage. The size is as described."
"I like that once it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s charged , it lasts long charging your phone. However for solar charging, it takes time to charge the pack."
"This is great. It charges quickly when plugged in, less quickly by solar panel. It's a good size to take camping, hiking, or rafting/boating, and not too heavy. It charges up my cell phone or kindle pretty quickly.I think it's best to start a trip fully charged and just top up by solar power, as it gets quite hot if you leave it in the sun long enough to charge it fully using solar power.The clip on the side is not so useful to hook it to a pack while hiking, and is plastic. One on the top and the bottom to secure it and it's orientation to the sun would be much better and more secure. Just dangling from one hook doesn't work."
I recommend this product to everyone. Great use in an emergency and everyday use. Great product for the price. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s holds a charge and doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t and takes about an hour to charge. Can charge multiple devices at once. Has multiple charging ports and adapters.
Not as good as expected
"Heavy, Not good quality cading, Works ok ok, Solar charging is useless."
