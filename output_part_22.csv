White mountain is a good brand for a shoe or a boot. I found the sizing to be spot on. I am an 8 1/2 wide and that is exactly what I ordered and it fit comfortably. This is a good walking boot as well as fashionable. Functional and fashionable definitely would order again.
"Cliffs always makes good quality boots. This has a non skid sole, lightweight, comfortable and is warm. Absolutely love this. Only downfall is it doesn't have zippers but this is no big deal. I'm a zipper girl lol."
These boots are very cute but a bit hard to pull on. Always need to loosen up the laces.
"These are even nicer than the photos. The material feels nice and sturdy, as do the soles. The furry cuff can fold up for a taller shaft, which is nice. The sweater collar is soft. After wearing the boots for only a few minutes, my feet were toasty. The fit is a wee bit large; I ordered a 10 and they fit like a 10.5, very generous. It's good because that gives me room for thick socks. I haven't worn them outside yet or for an extended period of time, but they feel comfortable. I'll try to update in a couple weeks after I've worn them in a bit. Overall, I really like these! I think they'll be great.EDIT I ended up returning them. They were just a bit too big and it made me feel self-conscious, like my feet looked like clown shoes. It was disappointing because they're beautiful boots. I also realized that I really like having a side zip, and these have none."
"You wouldn't think for this affordable price that these would last this long, but I bought them for a 10 day trip to Ireland, and I put A LOT of steps on these, from mud, to puddles, to cobblestones, everything. They were also really comfortable - not too hot, but cosy. Easy to wear in all weather while we were there, and great multi-purpose boots now that I'm home."
Really cute and warm! Was hard to put on at first because its slip on basically but once you loosen it up its good to go!
"I received these new Terrex at 6 am today and at 8 am went to a 5 miles trail, really comfortable, water proof, looks good and fit good ,"
"Adidas are the only brand I buy online because I know I won't have any fit problems. I wear a normal Size 10 and these fit as expected. They look cool and they are comfortable. Great traction and no issues so far. I will update this review should I have any issues when I put miles on these.Update 1: This is my second pair of Adidas Terrex shoes. My other pair are Terrex Skychaser LT GTXs. These AX4 are a little bit different. The toe box is a little bit more narrow. Not a problem for me, but keep this in mind if you have wide feet. Also, the sole and heel of the AX4 is much more firm. These are not squishy when you walk or run, but the sole is very supportive."
Love the look and feel of the shoes. I wear a 13 in all my other shoes. These definitely don’t fit the same. Had to return and order a 14. They fit perfect.
"My husband moves furniture as a job so he needs comfortable shoes, and he really likes these. The treads are wearing down pretty quickly because they are being used for intense work. They fit well and don't cause his feet to hurt. He has not complained about his back hurting nearly as much since he started wearing these."
"I bought the olive Terrex AX4 hiking shoes without Gore-Tex fabric online accidentally while not paying complete attention. I love my black Terrex AX3 shoes with Gore-Tex and I thought something in a different color would be good. The AX3’s with G-T are a little better hiking shoe than the AX4 generation. The 3’s have better rubber outer toe support/protection and are a little more supportive shoe with better tread. The tread on the 3’s is also more knobby, but it doesn’t wear down as fast and has great traction on slippery surfaces. With the Gore-Tex fabric it’s also more durable in areas the shoe breaths. The AX4 without G-T looks like it has lower quality construction on some parts to me. The tread on the bottom is good, it’s the same harder Continental rubber from the AX3 generation. The lugs on the shoe are flatter though and I think they’ll wear down quicker making some surfaces slippery.  On the AX4 they have more fabric on the toe and less rubber which I think will lead to more stubbed toes and shoe scuffing/damage. Additionally without G-T the meshy fabric on the shoe where it breaths looks cheap and I think it will snag and damage easily if you’re somewhat hard on shoes or use them in the woods. The mesh reminds me of a lower quality mesh fabric on Nike or Adidas walking/running shoes you see at department stores. In some photos online the AX4 has images of white speckles on the bottom rubber/tread area of the shoes. I think the white specks are just poor editing. When looking closely though, I did notice very little speckles of black rubber or rubber dust in the gray rubber on the shoe. If you look closely, the gray has texture on it. I think that comes from the shoe going into a mould or something that makes contact with it to make that texture pattern. I think the black is rubber dust or debris not completely cleaned out of some moulds or whatever makes contact when the gray rubber when it’s textured and formed. I can also see little glue fibers in some spots where the shoe was glued to the tread. They also must wipe the shoe down if it gets over glued or before it gets shipped away. 1 shoe had little fibers on it like a throw away cloth or paper towel had wiped 1 shoe. I’m still going to wear these shoes, but they’re not something I’d wear hiking or in the woods. I’d wear them running errands or hanging out with friends. My suggestion is if you want a great hiking shoe get the AX3 with Gortex. I imagine they’ll be discontinued at some point for the newer models coming. I wear the AX3’s for both work and everyday. They truly hold up to whatever I can put them through. I think the AX4 especially without Gore-Tex needs improvements to be considered a hiking shoe."
"I own several pairs of these shoes, in both low and high top. They are light weight, comfortable, durable, and excellent for everyday wear or outdoor activities. I wear mine for hiking, rappelling, canyoneering, caving, etc. I also wore them as duty boots for regular patrol and SAR missions. They fit true to size. The soles stick to pretty much any surface, even when wet. They will not stick to wet mossy surfaces though, but what shoe does? The ones with Gortex dry super-fast."
On the first wear it felt tight. As I walked they loosened up and they feel great. My new fav. I personally love the style and they are a perfect all around shoe for me. I walk and these are excellent.
"he loves them, had to go1/2 size bigger for comfort but otherwise a nice seemingly sturdy shoe."
Comfy and looks stylish
Love these boot. I used them on my motorcycle rides in cold weather. Nice quality product. Waterproof & keep your feet warm. Don't buy if your feet are wide. Fits snug probably D or M.
Your review process is way to early. I haven't tried them out yet. The look is good and the fit in fine. Check back in three months or so.
I got these boots to use outside on my farm. I needed something that could hold up to daily use and also be warm as our temperatures can get into the 20s or less. I am pleased with these boots. They are comfortable and keep my feet warm. Especially for the price you pay.They are a little on the heavy side but I think that’s just because they hold up well. Worth the buy.
"These kept my husband feet absolutely dry and he said “if I didn’t have these boots you got me I would be hating life right now!” As we walked through melting mush.I will say they DO NOT WORK WELL IN ICE. Slippery as all get out on the ice. But in the snow, which is what they are designed for, they are perfect!!!! Great boots and the price is perfect.Recommend purchasing"
"Okay, snow boots should last in SO Cal.Very comfortable. Only wore them when it rained.I think I bought them in December.I noticed this morning as I was cleaning them that the left boot has a hole wearing through the rubber. Cheap manufacturing. Very bummed. I really liked these. Zippers are a bitch. They make me late for events."
"These boots are very comfortable, my feet stays warm and dry , my only grieve is the zipper keeps going down but other then that these boots are very comfortable. Revised after wearing these boots for a month . Like I said the boots fit like a glove an the zipper comes down often but if you put your pants legs over the zipper they stay up I don’t know if this will help other out but for me the zippers stays up . I’m still wearing the boots an yes they are very water proof . My feet stays warm an dry an I recommend these boots to anyone . They are awesome an I would purchase these boots again ."
"Husband says that these boots are heavy, but they provide a lot of stability for his ankles. They kept his feet very warm, but almost too warm, because they made his feet sweat, lol). He asked me to order him a 2nd pair though, so he really likes them!"
"I bought these boots for working outside in NE Ohio. We get a good bit of lake effect snow and I needed a warm pair of boots. The 3m thinsulate keeps your feet well warm. I have worn the in 0 degrees Fahrenheit and have not had any issues.My two downsides to the boots are that the zipper will slowly work its way down as you walk and the boots are actually too warm at times. If you wear these over say 20 degrees Fahrenheit, your feet may sweat and make them colder"
This was excellent when testing it outside. I stayed nice and warm and had no problems whatsoever.
"I (5'9"" woman with average sized head) bought two of these two years ago, and am now buying a third so that my two kids and I all have one. My 7yo and 10yo boys have heads the same size as mine (they inherited giant heads from their dad, lol), and this balaclava works great for both of them and for myself. It's not terribly thick, but if it were it wouldn't fit under a helmet well, and it's thick enough to keep us warm! We've used them 3-5 times a year for the past two years (we don't generally use them unless the temps dip down in to the teens or lower, not counting wind-chill), and I've put them through the dryer numerous times and the washer several times, and these have held up well. The face-covering portion is just right--not too tight and not too loose. For adults with huge heads, though, this probably won't be ideal--it's too small to be comfortable for my husband (he wears size 8 in baseball hats, for reference)."
"This balaclava ski mask has quickly become a must-have in my winter gear collection. Whether I’m hitting the slopes, riding my motorcycle, or just braving a cold day, this mask delivers in every way.Warm and Cozy: The material is soft and insulating, keeping my face, neck, and head warm even in freezing temperatures. It’s perfect for those chilly mornings when the wind is biting, providing full coverage without being bulky.Breathable and Comfortable: Despite its warmth, the mask is surprisingly breathable. I never feel suffocated or overheated, even during intense activities like skiing or snowboarding. The fabric wicks away moisture, keeping me dry and comfortable throughout the day.Versatile Fit: The design is flexible and fits comfortably under my helmet, making it ideal for motorcycle riding as well. It stretches to accommodate different head sizes, so both men and women can wear it without any issues.Durable and High-Quality: The stitching is strong and well-finished, ensuring this mask will last through many winters. It’s been through multiple washes and still looks and feels brand new.Multi-Purpose Use: I love how versatile this mask is. Whether I’m skiing, snowboarding, biking, or just taking a walk on a cold day, this balaclava provides the protection and warmth I need. It’s also great for layering under other gear.If you’re looking for a reliable and comfortable winter face mask, this balaclava is a fantastic choice. It’s become an essential part of my cold-weather wardrobe, and I highly recommend it for anyone who spends time outdoors in the winter."
"I had been using a wool balaclava for years; they were the ones with open eye sockets, nose and mouth orifices. They were heavy, constrictive and overall, they were not as comfortable as I wanted. I discovered this pair which not only had better visibility, breathability, multiple ways of wearing it and much more comfortable as well as keeping my face warm. Also, my hearing is not impaired which is ofter an overlooked feature but which may well prove to be an indispensable safety feature. With a good pair of goggles, I am now fully protected from harsh wind, snow and ice while outside. These are perfect for my needs and I expect you will feel the same. Oh yes, they are well made and I expect them to wear very well."
Does the job and not scratchy
"I’ve been using it during my morning cycling sessions, and it’s been fantastic for keeping the chill at bay. The protection it offers from the wind and the October cold, around 40°F, is impressive. It keeps my face, neck, and head warm, which makes a big difference on those brisk early rides. The material feels soft against the skin, and the snug fit provides comfort without being too tight or restricting.Wearing it under a helmet is no problem at all; it fits perfectly without adding bulk or making the helmet feel uncomfortable. One of the best features is its versatility – I can easily slip the face mask down when I just want to use it as a hat, which is really convenient for times when I need to cool down a bit. Overall, it’s an excellent choice for anyone needing reliable cold-weather protection for outdoor activities like cycling, skiing, snowboarding."
"Glasses still fog up really bad unless your glasses are over the mask and the mask is rubbing your eyeballs. Also the neck cover needs to be longer, it constantly gets pulled out of my collar with the turn of my neck. It’s warm and is comfortable if you can get past the little things. Don’t have to worry about foggy glasses if you don’t wear them lol"
This works great and fits great also would definitely recommend very fast shipping would buy again
"I bought this as I work outside on rooftops all day and started getting wind burn in fall / when the snow started to fly. Immediately I noticed dispute the material being thin, it kept me warm and kept the wind off my face well. Would recommend as it feels high quality and works well."
It fits
Thank you
A must have product for very cold climate areas. The material is very soft and provides good warmth cover. Will recommend for all hikers and bikers
"I really like this package deal because it include all important and basic supplies I need for emergency.I never thought of shove, tent, camp light and knife with variety tool I might need.The price was perfect because prime deal and quick shipping!The bag was nice size and small. I like the color and type of quality . It believe this bag would last alittle bit longer compare to plastic box.Nice quick zipper and extra pocket inside."
All the essentials. Not too big but full of what you need.
"I knew what I was getting into, with the price I knew quality wasn’t gonna be amazing. And yes, as the reviews say, it is tiny and jam-packed with stuff. The tools are also tiny and if you want full sized tools, this ain’t it, chief. But there’s a lot of pretty decent stuff here. But some of the stuff just doesn’t work, or is just useless and probably could buy a better replacement separately if you need, probably cheap.For example, the compasses are sorta junk, the standalone one is finicky but can get an accurate read, wouldn’t rely on it and would suggest buying a separate one.Especially the “compass” in the handle of one of the tools, totally junk. Same style as the one in my power bank I bought from tiktok. Just floats around in there and doesn’t actually work at all.The folding knife I was actually pretty impressed with. It doesn’t have a good lock so it can technically fold back in during use but I haven’t had that. The blade is pretty dang sharp, sharper than my own pocket knife I carry. Enough that I gave my self a small cut trying to see its sharpness. Very lightweight but transportable because of the skeletonI won’t entertain the idea of the spoon, fishing line, or glow sticks, like I’d ever actually use them. I’m sure they’d work in a pinch but not why I bought this.Haven’t put batteries in the lamp or flashlight, but I assume they should work, if not I’ll change the review.I also didn’t take the tent, blankets, or the poncho out cause I didn’t feel like folding them back up again.The “medkit” is pretty basic. Wouldn’t use it on its own. Other than to help with the cut I got from the blade lol. But I’ll likely order some more and see if I can’t just fit it inside the bag. If not I’ll bite the bullet and buy a full medkit. Cause if this were a video game it would only restore like 5hp. There’s some bandages and I think a bit of gause, but it’s mostly i think betadine and alcohol wipes, and bandaids. I think some aspirin pills or something possibly. Aka, this would be good for school nurses. *ER* Nurse, well, not on any day.The survival bracelet is ok. Whistle works as expected but the compass again is junk and doesn’t work. The bracelet isn’t adjustable from what I can tell, and since I have skinny wrists it was pretty loose on me. I haven’t tested the fire starter inside the bracelet, or the other standalone fire starter. Was about to but came to my senses that I was inside, and I didn’t want to light my carpet on fire… So, I’ll have to bring it outside when it’s not raining. Again, I’ll update the review if either one don’t workPhone case worked and you actually can use the screen which I thought was neat. Didn’t really buy this for that at all but, seeing as it works, it might come in handy one day.I forgot about the “saber card” I think it was called. Still have no idea what the heII that is lol. I suppose the tools on it might work but I really wouldn’t likely use. Still baffles me and cracks me up that they put a mini ruler on it for whatever reason. But if you ever need to measure something 3 inches…uh…on second thought keep it to yourselfI highly doubt you’ll ever need as many q-tips out there in the wilderness as there is. Unless you’re cleaning a rifle or something, but you’d probably want a different kit for that.I’m going off of memory here so I’ll probably miss something but I wouldn’t recommend buying this pack for any one thing in particular, just for the convienience of everything all in one bag, and having it all shipped for a flat fee and you can decide what you need and don’t.Oh right, the wire saw. I probably won’t even open that but I doubt it’s that good.To be honest, the best part of this is the kid in me opening it all up, cause there’s a LOT of stuff. Pretty fun even though some of it was junk. But some stuff I hope to never need. But having survival stuff like this gives me some comfort in preparation. But I also wouldn’t recommend this being your “bug-out bag.” Or just your only survival equipment in general. But rather, because of its size it could maybe be a simple portable version you take out with you. Or like I will do, because of the strap on system, have it as bag attachment to a bigger rucksack with a more complete bag. Imma be honest though, the whole thing all in one bag is pretty beefy, I don’t know how many pounds but in my hands felt pretty heavy. That’s why I think having it on a rucksack might be better than carrying it around with you"
"Hands down one of the best purchases from Amazon. Everything is high quality, all useful items. Everything is packed well, with individual carrying cases for the majority of the items. Looking forward to using this. I recommend you get one for each person in your camp. I did."
"This was great. Me, my dad, and brother had a great time outdoors hiking a mountain nearby. This bag is small and looks like it doesn’t hold much, that’s why I was happy and surprised with all the items that came in it. They really thought of everything. Fishing supplies, small knife and axe, saws, emergency tent, emergency blanket, thorough fist aid kit, and other things. It’s pretty light even with some of the heavier items like the small axe/hammer. The knives are actually sharp too so they do their job. I definitely recommend."
Smaller than I thought for some reason and yet very practical and useful.
"Unfortunately, I went ahead and bought this, and I truthfully don’t care if anybody believes me or not, but I am just slightly disappointed. I’m usually pretty chill about everything I buy even when some things have a few issues or flaws. I never really write reviews either but this time I thought, “what the heck.”After reading all of these reviews mentioning how small this item, much smaller then they thought, I was prepared—or so I thought. It still kind of shocks you just how small it really is lol everything is basically miniature and only a few items are of decent quality i.e. the pen and the paracord, multi-functional wrist band. That being said, it’s still a cool little bag of goodies for the right person, but to be honest, to bring everybody into the light here, the perfect candidate to gift this to is your 10-12 year old son or nephew for his annual Boy Scout camping trip. Hayden, Bryce and Aiden will absolutely love it. Take that however you may, just know I don’t mean it’s only pertinent to a 10-12 year old boy but it’s really just for some buying perspective and may help you know what you’re looking for…everybody’s opinion is different, so, I digress.So, I’ll say the quality of this set is borderline fisher•price/playskool if you ask me.. erector set to be as fair as I can. Now, as a 33 year old adult male, I was feeling quite silly taking everything out—almost reminding me as if I were an 11 year old boy performing a cringeworthy, family arranged play around a campfire at the annual up-north Kumbaya soirée with uncle chubbs, cousin Bert and the whole gang, whilst the theme of the play being an educational demonstration of the key tactics of survival. Only not good. Not good at all. (cousin Bert starts the slow clap…) Berrrrt…Bert! Shhhhhh!!!!! Not yet. Smh. Bert.My point is that if you are looking for a nice, real survival kit, and you’re over, okay, let’s say the age of 15 to be as fair as possible, this is not for you.Everything is much smaller than you will expect, even after knowing this bit of info. Again, opinions differ, so, if this is just something you want to have in case of a minor emergency, anything can really be useful in that situation, even this fanny-pack of “survival” tools.I love you all, so, jot that down."
Not too bad but the lantern is pocket sized and made of the cheapest materials but still very bright.
"I feel like I‚Äôm always in the go. My mornings generally consist of drinking a coffee made from my keurig machine, but on those days that I have more time, I prefer drinking something a bit more customized. I don‚Äôt want a coffee maker because of how much storage and counter space it takes, and my last French press shattered in the dish washer. So this Stanley pour over made out of stainless steel is really appealing to me. Its sized perfectly for the cup, our even using it over tumblers/mugs. It‚Äôs a great product that will last years to come. And yes, it makes a good cup of coffee (without the need for filters)."
"I love every Stanley product I own. I usually use disposable pour over filters, but I wanted to try this. The quality is amazing. This is perfectly priced.  Super easy to clean! Can make a big cup of coffee or a small one. Holds a ton of water. And is super easy to use!"
"I‚Äôve never purchased a Stanley item before. I heard of them because of the target Black Friday last year where people went crazy over the tumblrs. I think carrying something so big is obnoxious and I avoided this brand for a long time because of the stigma. I was looking for a coffee maker that made a single cup and I didn‚Äôt have to use pods or electricity for some coffee at my work desk. I should have known to look for camping stuff! This is perfect for me. I‚Äôm a bit of a coffee snob and aside from the waste of plastic I was not a fan of the freeze dried coffee flavor from pods. You get great flavor from this although it only needs to brew for 4 min. I get bougie ground coffee and never had a problem with the grinds seeping through. I also always put flower petals in the top for extra flavor- and it does a great job at seeping them into the coffee but never see them in my cup. Oh- and I read the Stanley promise, I love that you can call them for replaced parts instead of purchasing the whole set which makes me feel comfortable about my purchase. I have mugs at home but I was nervous about buying the pour over separately in case it‚Äôs not compatible with any of the mugs I own. It seems like it totally would be, but the set is aesthetically pleasing. I also HATE stainless steel items because I can taste the metal. I think coffee is a strong flavor to begin with, but luckily I don‚Äôt taste metal at all with Stanley :)"
"I purchased this for a camping trip. It was easy to clean and stored well in a small space. The coffee mug has a nice lid but I wish it had a magnetic slider to close it so bugs can‚Äôt get in my mug.It takes a few minutes to trickle down from the filter into the mug, but that was expected.Overall, I give it 5 stars. Money well spent."
"Pros-it‚Äôs fun to use and the brew is tasty. Fairly easy to make a cup in a few minutes. Looks great on any counter was one of the appeals that drew me in. Good size for a limited space/storage situation with the 2 piece design. Use the built in filter or paper filter - even at home the paper filter is best solution for me.Cons-2 piece setup doesn‚Äôt attach, do don‚Äôt knock the top over! No issues so far just fyi. Again, the included metal filter works fine, but in a camper (limited water) to rinse and clean after each brew (will not let any grinds go down the RV sink) I immediately bought a large pack of cheap paper filters and they work great- zero mess but does add to the waste can. And a biggie here. I love the mug but the base is too big for for a couple of my vehicle‚Äôs so have hold onto it. I use hot just boiled water but the brew isn‚Äôt that hot when finished? Which actually I use the lowest heat setting on the Kureig anyway but this is only sort of warm??Last con-uses more coffee per brew vs. my reusable k-cup. Toting a lot of coffee for the Stanley is a consideration when packing for travel in a small space. So‚ÄîI‚Äôll keep it for the house- it‚Äôs cool and fun to use at home with a good tasting brew. (I use retail Maxwell or Folgers medium ground) it‚Äôs economical and good enough coffee for me!However, I‚Äôll buy a slim Kureig‚Äôs for the Sprinter so I can reuse my old refillable k-cup and have the handy attached water tank as well."
"The quality expected from Stanley. Makes a good cup of coffee, running water to help rinse out the strainer is helpful.  I would like an engineer genius to figure out how to make this identical item, but nested to store smaller and pack easier. Great for camping with facilities and storage spaces, but not as convenient for backpacking trips. The good cup of coffee in the morning gets it 5 stars, and I would take it backpacking, but I'm looking for something more convient to stuff in a backpack."
"As always Stanley makes high quality products, and this is no exception! Very easy to use and also very easy to clean! Brews up coffee or tea in just a min or two and very low profile so easy to pack for your trip or outing! Will buy again if this one ever gets worn out ü´∂"
"While I don‚Äôt drink coffee my wife can‚Äôt start her day without it.  This was the perfect solution for when we go rustic camping for her to get her coffee in the AM.  It‚Äôs easy enough to use just heat up some water out your grounds in the top piece, set the top piece on top of the cup and pour your water over the grounds.  The coffee drips down into the cup which she says is the perfect size cup of coffee for her in the morning. The product works great and while it want the cheapest my wife thinks it wads a great purchase."
"I recently added the Stanley The Camp Pour Over Coffee Set to my collection of coffee gadgets, and I must say, it has been an absolute game-changer for my morning routine. This pour over coffee set has truly exceeded my expectations in every aspect.The first thing that struck me was the amazing quality of this product. The stainless steel construction gives it a sturdy and durable feel, ensuring it will withstand the test of time. It's clear that Stanley has poured attention to detail into crafting a product that exudes excellence.Using it couldn't be simpler. Whether you're a coffee connoisseur or a beginner, the intuitive design makes it a breeze to create a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. The step-by-step process is straightforward, and I found myself effortlessly brewing a rich and flavorful cup every time. It's as easy as adding your coffee grounds, pouring hot water, and watching the magic unfold.One of the standout features of this coffee set is its promise of longevity. With proper care, I have no doubt that this pour over set will last forever. The quality materials used in its construction give me the confidence that I'll be enjoying my favorite brews from this set for years to come. It's an investment that's definitely worth making for any coffee enthusiast.A notable bonus is the versatility of the Stanley Camp Pour Over Coffee Set. Not only does it fit perfectly on various Stanley mugs and bottles, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it also fits seamlessly with my existing mugs and bottles. This adaptability adds an extra layer of convenience, making it an ideal companion for outdoor adventures, road trips, or simply enjoying a cozy morning at home."
"The battery pack is light weight. It does appear charging in Sun light with green light and blue lights on. Solar panel charging is slow as expected with Photovoltaic cells. It helps on camping trips and emergency situations. The flashlight is not bright, may be less than 100-150 lumens at most like a cell phone. I didn‚Äôt test the full capacity of the battery pack though. It appears robust enough, time will tell about the performance and reliability."
"I love this solar power pack. I bought it for hurricane season but soon learned so many times I use it. Great for camping, hiking, really any outdoor activity. Love the light and SOS feature. Very durable, easy to use. As expected solar charging is slower but gets the job done, especially during power outages. Clips right on to my backpack and is rain resistant."
"I bought this solar phone charger a few days before Hurricane Milton, thinking I was being super prepared for the biggest hurricane to hit the Tampa area. I knew we‚Äôd be without power for a while, and I thought this would be a lifesaver. Well, I was right about losing power, but this charger totally let me down! It barely held 2 out of 4 capacity and didn‚Äôt keep my phone charged when I needed it most. It was pretty scary being without reliable power, and this charger just wasn‚Äôt up to the task. Definitely looking forward to returning it for something more trustworthy!"
"This power bank is ideal for outdoor adventures, offering multiple full charges for devices and the ability to charge two devices at once. The solar panel provides a small boost in sunlight, best suited for emergencies rather than full recharges. Its rugged, splash-proof design includes a built-in flashlight and compass giving it even more functionality. Overall, it‚Äôs a reliable power bank for long trips but isn‚Äôt ideal if you‚Äôre relying solely on solar charging."
"I like this product a lot, but today the flashlight just randomly stopped working! It worked three days ago, and I‚Äôve used this item very minimally. I can‚Äôt get to the manufacturers website to get support. Huge bummer. Of course I did all the appropriate troubleshooting, and the battery appears to be charged fully. However, the light is not turning on at all. You might consider looking elsewhere for a better product."
"This portable at least 2x lighter than my old portable but performs the same if not better. Takes a few hours to charge but once it charges fully, it lasts me around 4-5 charges on iphone 12 pro max. Great product can't complain."
What that means is. Husband goes to training quite frequently. He is always needing battery packs for it. They are always super annoying to keep charged and make sure they are good to go. This pack was a life saver for his past training he used it for over a week and worked the entire time!
"Whenever I stop being grumpy, I'll purchase another one of these because it's really a great little charger. I bought this for a camping trip and used it maybe three times to charge my phone. LOVED IT. It fast charges my phone and it's solar powered, the flashlight was cool but the compass didn't work at all.So also.. my husband hung it up on a small d-ring we had on our boat and we forgot it there, just taking in beams of light as we drove across the lake. We hit maybe two waves and the only thing left was the cute little clip it came with.. so clearly the plastic on the actual device was less strong than the clip itself. Not saying that there's a manufacture issue for that specific of an issue because I doubt they account for being shaken violently while being tethered to a speeding boat, but hey.. there's always room for improvements haha you just never know. Maybe next time I come back to purchase it'll be renamed ""boat ready, can be shaken in 40mph winds"""

"I really liked this portable camping hammock! Itâ€™s lightweight and easy to pack, making it perfect for outdoor trips. Setting it up was a breeze, and it felt sturdy once hung between trees. The material is comfortable and breathable, so I stayed cool even in warmer weather.Itâ€™s also spacious enough to relax in comfortably, but compact enough to carry around without taking up too much room in my gear. The only thing I would improve is the strapsâ€”they could be a bit longer for more versatility. Overall, itâ€™s a fantastic hammock for camping!"

"I'd always wanted to buy a hammock but never did because of the high price of the ones I saw. To be honest I wasn't expecting too much of this item because it was so cheap. But, I was pleasantly surprised. It's an excellent hammock. Very sturdy and well made and extremely comfortable."
"Love it, easy to set up and very comfortable. Folds up in its own neat, small bag. I Keep it in the RV and use it when camping. I should have bought 2 of them."
Perfect for any yard or camping trip also hand for kids in bunk bed they love it or under the table in the fort cause the straps are long so versatile
"I'm really impressed with this hammock for the price! It packs away small, light enough for camping and beach trips. You can set it up by yourself in only a few minutes, the straps are sturdy and don't slip, and they are also bark safe which is important. It's not the most comfortable hammock, the design means you are basically swallowed in as soon as your weight is in there. It can be better sitting sideways and changing the weight distribution than laying lengthways. You almost need a support bar or something to hold it open like a more traditional style hammock."
