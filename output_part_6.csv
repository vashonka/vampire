it‚Äôs gift for friend she likes it
Takes amazing photos and captures the perfect moments ‚ù§Ô∏è
Did not receive a minimal packet of films as described
You Can got a lot of fun with this camera
"I purchased this camera for my daughter's photo guest book (later this year). I like the square look of the pictures, it is easy to use. I haven't tried the selfie option yet but will prior to the event."
"It's my birthday! It's my birthday!! No for real, it's my birthday and this camera is my present. I've always had a hankering to get a Polaroid camera so I saw this FujiFilm one and thought..must have! I am so glad I did because it's so fun! Now if your looking for high def pics, not for you, and you must not remember the 70s. This is a great little camera and the pictures are just big enough to see and small enough to collect in a small album or post on the fridge like I did with my Luna photo in this review. Go for it! You won't be disappointed! Oh and I highly recommend the rainbow film."
"Loved how easy this was to use and the size of the images. I think these are much nicer and more versatile than the normal instax mini sizing. We‚Äôve had a lot of fun with this camera and I think it makes a super fun gift as well.The pictures sometimes can turn out dark if it‚Äôs too bright so I think it‚Äôs best used in the evening / nighttime where the flash really works well at spotlighting subjects. I also bought the recommended case and the case is really bad so would not recommend that. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great camera and I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase!"
My girlfriend uses this all the time and loves it
"It has a lovely classic design, and several features that lets you compose different type of photos. A big advantage this camera has is that because it has memory and is digital, you can take shots and practice your shoots without worrying about running out of Instax film (and money). I love that you can use the instax mini app to print photos from your phone in mini instax film, it has been very handy. You can also customize your prints a bit and change the colors the zoom in/out so that it prints just like you want.A ""downside"" of being digital is that the photos are really good, which takes away some of the ""rustic feel"" that regular instax cameras have. This camera has a filter that imitates that feel a little bit, but it's not a perfect copy. This can be an upside if you want great and clear instax photos, or a downside if the experience you want is those rough colors from regular instax cameras.I recommend this product a lot though, it was praised nonstop by models and photographers when I took it to an event earlier this year. I think the price is an investment for the quality, features, convenience, and not spending money on film when practicing your shoots. 10/10"
"I love this camera! It’s so vintage looking and I’m glad I got the brown instead of the black color. It’s easy to use, it’s light weight and I love that you can choose which pictures to print since the film isn’t cheap. I also like the fact that once you print a picture, you can transfer it to your phone. It’s also cool that the camera also works as an instant printer from your phone so you don’t have to carry a separate instant printer with you. So far I love everything about this camera. My only complaint is that with the camera being expensive, I do wish it came with a lens cap."
Love all the features to print from my phone and the remote shoot etc. and the old time look is very cool
"It is so perfect and fun to use. You can connect it to your phone to use it as a preview and use it as a shutter button if placing the camera at a distance. You can edit and crop the photo directly on the camera. Printing made so easy and greatest of all, you can save so many films by picking the perfect photo!"
"It looks like a really nice camera from unboxing it. I turned it on and it had very low battery as expected you should charge it prior to first use. The LCD screen doesn't have the best display, however I wasn’t expecting much from that and it still serves its purpose as it should. Overall this looks like a really good camera and if I come across any issues I’ll be sure to update!"
"I really like the ability to see the pictures before you print them on this polaroid camera. The quality is very good for a polaroid camera. You can also print the same picture multiple times and adjust lighting and different types of lenses. This makes it so much better then the other polaroid cameras I have seen.However:1. when it is very bright outside, even while adjusting brightness settings, it's hard to get a perfect photo. It doesn't do a poor job, but it's quality is much lower in super high brightness.2. When you are in a darker setting, even when you turn off flash it still flashes. The setting doesn't need to be super dark and it happens more often then I would like.Overall, I think it's a really good option for a polaroid camera and much better then cameras that just print immediately and not a ton more expensive then the ones that produce much worse results, but there is some work to be done to improve the camera."
"Love my Instax Mini Evo! I added this camera to journal my other hobby. A quick picture of my work and it goes to my journal! Function is pure and simple as the old Instagram, but the best feauture is that the Mini Evo brings the classic to modern times. This is a hybrid camera that is both digital and analog. The value is saving money on film with being able to select your prints with the use of an internal memory and function with SD card slot.  But wait! There’s more! Bluetooth function lets you send your pictures from your phone to the camera and vice versa! All of this is excellent for me and has inspired me to jump to a new hobby"
Having a lot of fun with this camera. Very satisfying to print your pictures right away!
"The Fujifilm Instax Mini EVO Instant Camera is a delightful blend of nostalgia and modern innovation. Here's why I love it:Pros:- Innovative LCD screen for previewing and editing.- Produces sharp, vibrant prints with ease.- Offers digital capture alongside traditional instant printing.- User-friendly design for seamless operation.- Compact and portable for on-the-go use.Cons:- Print cost can add up over time.- Editing options on the LCD screen are somewhat limited.Overall, the Fujifilm Instax Mini EVO Instant Camera is a fantastic blend of modern technology and instant gratification, perfect for capturing and sharing memories in a fun and creative way."
"I've encountered several furniture assembly kits, and have to say I have NEVER been as pleased and gratified with the ease of assembly, clear instructions, and quality of a product as I am with my ODK Computer Desk.  The parts were clearly marked, of good quality, and I was easily able to assemble the desk with no problem.  Plus, it looks terrific.  I really appreciate the care ODK took to ensure their product was of good quality and provided all instructions and materials to make the assembly a breeze - all at a price within my budget!"
"Might be a little short for taller people, but it fits my needs. Fairly easy to put together and it looks great. Fits my laptop and second screen and still has enough room for water bottle, note taking, and a few other knicknacks."
I bought this desk as a back up desk/sewing table for my daughter. Great size and very sturdy. Had a little trouble putting it together as the instructions weren't great but we got it figured out.
The desk was packaged very well and fairly simple to put together with no missing parts. The drawers are cloth on the sides but still sturdy. The desk is very stable and could hold a larger tv/monitor on it easily. This was the perfect addition to finish off my guest room. The only thing I didn't care for is the extra holes on the front and it's not necessarily a huge deal but if it came with white caps or plugs to put over the screws or in the extra holes it'd be a tad more visually appealing. (Maybe I can find some) That tiny thing would not deter me from recommending this desk at all!!!
"I'm impressed. For a piece of furniture from a box, this surprised me, in a good way. The directions were perfect. Easy to understand and the diagrams well drawn. Very user friendly. It's so obvious that this company went the extra mile to make it easier for the consumer to assemble their product! The finished product impresses me too.  Nice and Sturdy! The drawers are cloth with a fabric covered cardboard insert for stability and the drawer fronts are made of thick material, ( probably not solid wood, but what ever wood substitute is used these days), and a handle for each drawer front. The drawers open and close well and softly. When you close the drawer fully, you hear and feel it fit perfectly shut in place. The price is reasonable! I'm highly impressed and plan to buy from this company again!"
"I was happy that this desk is actually exactly as pictured in the product photographs. It was well packaged from the manufacturer. Assembly is easy.Finishes came slightly damaged/scuffed in some places. Some metal parts transitioned from glossy and smooth to coarse and powdery feeling on the ends. Some frame members were not cut square, but it was not noticeable in the assembled product. The holes for the shelves were not drilled on center with one another, so there is an ever so slight lean in three of them. Ultimately, these are things that maybe only I would notice as I'm a quality assurance inspector for a living.Update:Seller is actively committed to customer service and quality products. They reached out to me after I left the review above. While I didn't need anything, I appreciate that they care."
The screws for installing the center leg post were too short. I had to buy longer ones. Some of the parts were mislabeled. There need to be plugs for the screw holes that are not used on the front legs.
"Good looking table, and easy to set up. Seems sturdy when set up as well. For the price, I think its a great product."
stylish and simple.  narrow to fit the space.
"Easy to put together, nice size and sturdy."
"I really like this deck; great size and height for the area I needed it. Only thing I don't like is the drawers are like, totes?? Not made of the same material as the rest of the desk. I wish they were. Still like it though."
Assembled very easy. Quite sturdy!I am not using the 'X' support bars as I'm using it for a nail table but it seems strong enough without. Very nice quality over all :) happy with my purchase for sure.  Just didnt realize that the drawers are fabric. Its ok though theyre good quality. Thanks!
"I do like this desk. Looks good, sturdy, easy to put together."
"I was looking for a desk for my craft room, that would be sturdy and small enough that it would not take up a lot of space.I ran across this desk. While a little apprehensive about the ""cloth drawers"", I decided to give it a try. I am far from being disappointed! This is one bargain buy! The desk frame is metal, yes, the drawers are cloth, but the heavy cardboard bottom not only gives the drawer its shape, but is quite sturdy. While it probably won't hold a 5 or 10 lb item, it certainly does the job for the average office items. It's lightweight enough that if you need to move it, you can easily pick it up and relocate.  It comes very well packaged, although I had the small computer stand board arrive broken. I have contacted the seller for a replacement. All hardware is included, along with tools to assemble.  The overall desk is sturdy and is well made. The instruction booklet is one of the better written set of instructions I've ever had. There were only a couple of points that I was confused on orientation, but looking ahead in the assembly guide, I was able to choose the correct assembly. This desk comes with 2 size options. The one I chose was the 61"", but this is also available in a 53"" version. There are 4 color options as well, black, oak grey, white, and vintage. The vintage is only available as a 53"".  Overall, this is a great buy, easy to put together, looks great, sturdy, and the price is easy on the budget.I'm considering replacing my present computer desk with one of these. LOVE IT!"
"After browsing for days I finally landed on this puppy and glad I did. I ordered the 61 inch, which has the perfect amount of space for multiple monitors and grad school work. Came quicker than expected, was super easy to assemble (zero alignment issues), and came with extra hardware. This desk is a great value for the price, especially because I bought it on sale for ~$120. Comes with 2 huge shelves, 3 spacious drawers, 3 triple prong outlets, 2 USB outlets, tons of leg room and is sturdy without being too heavy or bulky. Would recommend!"
"This desk was delivered very quickly in less than two days. It was carefully packaged, as the larger wooden parts arrived without any damage, despite my own mishap of letting the box fall over after moving into the house. The instructions were very easy and came with its own set of tools and the best part was it came with an allen key with a large black handle instead of those uncomfortable basic metal keys that strain my hand, making assembly even easier that even my three year was able to assist. Desk was well designed for anyone with a large computer setup or in my case, this was for my son that has a Chromebook hooked to a docking station, but needs extra desk space for reading and homework, and Lego building. I loved that there were minimal parts to assemble. My son loves his new desk, and soft drawers were a big selling point for me as he is constantly slamming drawers shut so now he can do so with minimal noise.  The only issue I had, otherwise I would have rated this five stars was that the fabric drawers had a slight chemical small, but I am used to that from other Amazon purchases so a couple sprays of febreeze and gain and the smell dissipated overnight. Overall very happy with my purchase."
"I recently set up the AODK 61-Inch L Desk, and it’s been perfect as a dual-purpose desk for both gaming and work. The spacious design easily fits my monitor, gaming setup, and work laptop with room to spare. The built-in drawers are a great addition, helping keep everything organized. One standout feature is the power extension setup on the desk—it’s so convenient for plugging in my phone, headset, and laptop without needing extra cords hanging around.The only minor drawback is that the desktop can smudge, especially with fingerprints, but using a microfiber towel makes it easy to keep it clean. I wasn’t comfortable with it at first until i got an office chair that changes heights cause the desk is an inch or two too tall but it’s comfy and looks great. Overall, this desk has been a fantastic upgrade for my setup! BTW the drawers are felt :) they still work tho they sometimes droop when you open them too far out if they are heavy."
"I actually love this desk. It was fairly easy to put together. It works great in my office with my desktop computer and 2 printers. It's sturdy and pretty nice. I thought it was going to be cheaply made at first but I love it. The drawers are not what I expected, but even they are working out good."
"For the cost this desk is a great value. There are a lot of parts to assemble. Looks great, sturdy and fit my office exactly as measured"
"Okay, so, it took 3 hours to set this up with 2 people. It was easy enough to assemble I suppose, but the figures/images are mirrored (at least for the right-side, not sure about left side instructions)  and the instructions don't make much intuitive sense (diagrams are confusing). Originally I wanted a right-sided desk. So we followed the right sided desk instructions. However, It ended up as a left sided desk.  Thankfully it still fit in my space,  we just had to put it against a different wall. But like,  the instructions were utterly terrible. We eventually held the right sided instructions up in the mirror and it appeared correct that way,  lol... but we didn't read the instructions through a mirror until we were on like, step 9 (out of 13). HOWEVER, the desk works and looks GREAT... if you can figure out how to assemble it correctly. There was some extra hardware included."
"This desk is great, very easy to assemble. It fits perfectly where I needed it.  Sturdy and great quality for a low cost."
"I ordered this at 47"" Vintage finish, on sale for $59, and I didn't notice until after that it was only 19"" deep(front to back). That's my mistake for not checking. The product looks amazing. Arrived in perfect shape despite a hole in the box (probably my delivery driver). The table top has a nice smooth finish, all the parts were ready to go and easy to assemble, even if you're alone, although a second person helps a lot though. I decided to keep it because it's a great-looking and space-saving surface to use even if I don't use it for a computer desk. I'm still ambivalent on that, because of one thing-the top piece is rather flexible, even with the included brace underneath of it. All the legs and the brace are hollow aluminum, I believe, as I dented some of them just tightening up screws. It keeps the item very light-weight though, probably less than 20lbs. If I was the seller I would look at a stiffer cross-brace underneath the top. I may add a solid board, personally. Regardless, it's a good desk and a nice fit for a slim area. I would personally recommend this as the L-shape addition or multi-use desk, feels a bit too slim for heavy pc gaming/equipment. Would probably be great for a laptop though, or a one-monitor setup with the tower on the edge over a leg5 stars because despite being kind of flimsy even with the brace, and legs are a bit too easy to bend, desk has a great price (on sale $30 off at least), great appearance, and comes in multiple sizes for different usages."
We bought this desk to have in our spare room. It worked great for my son who stayed with us for a month.  He used it every day to have his laptop and 2nd monitor set up on.  The hook was handy to hold his headset.  It's sturdy enough for daily use but don't put anything too heavy on it.  It suits our needs perfectly.
"A pretty good desk for about 30$, simple to assemble. Nothing fancy but works well enough"
"I love this table every easy to install.. it’s not heavy but very sturdy, well worth the money. I love that it’s real wood"
Perfect size for my home office. Can fit my monitor and keyboard easily. Good size for small places. Easy to put together. Great buy for the price.
"Let me share a little cautionary tale with you. When I got this computer desk, I was so eager to set it up that I decided to take a little shortcut. The instructions called for attaching these beams that cross between the legs, but I thought, “Pfft, how important could those be?” Spoiler alert: They’re *really* important.I happily ignored them, thinking I’d save a few minutes. Big mistake. Huge. Fast forward to me trying to type, and suddenly it felt like I was on a boat in the middle of a storm. The desk started wobbling with every keystroke, and let’s just say, it made writing an email feel like a high-stakes balancing act.So, take it from me—those beams are there for a reason. Don’t skip them unless you’re looking to turn your workday into a shaky adventure. Once I grudgingly went back and attached them, the desk turned into the solid, reliable piece of furniture it was always meant to be.Overall, this desk is great—plenty of space, nice design, and when assembled *correctly*, it’s sturdy as a rock. Just don’t be like me and try to cut corners. Trust the process, and you’ll end up with a fantastic desk that doesn’t double as a seesaw."
Very nice and basic desk that is extremely easy to put together.
"Delivery was good, item assembly was good, height, width and length were good. However, my 14 y.o. son leans on everything. He's 110 lbs. and while getting up from the table it cracked close to the right edged corner near the attaching screw points.So now we don't darn place anything like my children gaming computers/ laptops on the top of the other two tables I had bought for this purpose. I think we'll will stick with solid wood or possible thicker acrylic made tables. I gave it 3 stars simple because of the points mentioned above."
As expected
Took a bit longer to assemble but worth it! Definitely good value for the money.

"This desk great! The directions were extremely easy to follow and made for a very easy assemble. I needed a desk for my work from home job and my puzzle hobby, and this is just what I need. Not wide enough for larger puzzles, but I knew that before purchasing. I recommend to anyone looking for an affordable, well made desk."
"Update: Customer service reached out to me and was eager to work with me to fix my issues. They were extremely helpful and I am now totally satisfied with the resolution options provided and the steps they have been willing to undertake in order to fix the issues. This, in my opinion, has totally been worth adding a couple stars back to their rating based on how professionally they handled the situation.The desk is actually pretty sturdy considering its smaller size. The storage for this size desk is impressive and setup wasn't difficult at all. However, there are certainly some negatives worth discussing. Firstly, the instructions for building the desk are sufficient but would definitely benefit from a bit more clarity, both in terms of pictures shown as well as descriptions provided. The built-in power outlet is a nice feature but the outlets are just a bit too close together so if plugging in any plug which is just a bit wider than normal, then the outlet next to it will be obstructed. The largest upset for me with this whole desk setup has been the quality. For a brand new desk, I expect the components to be free of cracks, scratches, dirt, and poor quality. When removing the different pieces from the packaging, one piece has a crack in it and a couple pieces appear to be ""stained"" with dirt which I have been unable to successfully clean. Being brand new, these quality issues simply aren't acceptable. I understand that this is more of a ""budget"" desk, but quality is still lacking a bit for a supposedly unused item. Lastly. the corner of the desk by my left elbow (inner part of the L-shape extension) does not have a clean transition with the veneer which causes a sharp corner. The desk has potential and I think deserves a bit higher than 2-stars, however 3-stars just seems to high considering these quality issues for a brand new product. It sucks to get a new item that starts off damaged from day 1 :("
"This looks really good in my room. I am an online college student. When I say these directions were well thought out, these directions made it so easy to put together. It was a picture guide with both options to build available. There were letters on the materials and a bag of screws and tools with numbers on them to use for what step you were working on. As long as you put the coinciding piece of the desk with the numbered nail or screw, that was it!! I didn‚Äôt need something big, but I appreciate the extra ‚ÄúL‚Äù space on the side for a book or somewhere to sit my extra stuff. The corners of the top of the desk are a little sharp so I would suggest the little corner pieces of plastic that come with the desk to save your arms from getting scratched. I‚Äôve done that already but hadn‚Äôt thrown the box away yet so I put them on there. I was pleasantly surprised at just how practical it is. It‚Äôs really cute and the price point was nice as well. My new desk is really nice. I like it a lot."
"This desk is solid and the perfect size for where I put it in my home. The drawers hold plenty of paperwork and desktop accessories that I don't want out all the time, and the two shelves I use for candles (not burning them there), a pen cup, etc. The power connector on top is out of the way and with 3 plugs and 2 USB ports perfectly fits my needs and convenience."
"This desk is a good size and pretty sturdy. Took two people to set it up and the directions are just ok. The main desk panel came stained and it literally will not come off. Didn‚Äôt see it till we got to the end unfortunately and not worth dismantling, but that and the chipped drawer bring the rating way down. This was cheaper but not cheap cheap. I expected better."
"I've used high-end electric desks at work, and since you typically get what you pay for, I was a bit wary of buying one for home that was so relatively inexpensive. But overall the reviews were positive enough (especially regarding customer service) and there were some good tips regarding assembly, so I figured it was worth the risk.Both boxes arrived with the contents in perfect condition: the boxes used very thick, heavy cardboard, and the corner protectors on the desktop were made of a very dense rubber. I've unpacked a lot of furniture (assembling desks for classrooms and computer labs), and the packaging for this desk puts many so-called ""commercial"" products to shame. Any damage that might occur would be due to careless shipping and handling - not how the factory packed it.Assembling the desk was straightforward enough, although I've put together enough of this sort of furniture over the years that there weren't any surprises. Just take your time, follow the steps, and you'll be fine. This can be assembled by one person, but a second set of hands will make things easier.All of the pre-drilled holes lined up where they were supposed to. One assembly tip: line up one of the end holes in a leg with its corresponding hole in the desktop, and drop a thin nail into the hole to give it something to pivot around. Then with that hole aligned, line up each of the other holes, again dropping a thin nail into each one until they're all aligned. Then drive the screws, replacing each nail, one at a time. No guesswork, no misaligned screws, no do-overs.The only two pilot holes I had to add were for the center crossbar, so you will need a drill and a small bit (a hand drill or pin vise would work for this). For driving all of the screws I used a hand screwdriver, so I wouldn't run the risk of stripping out the particle board.Everything went together very nicely. There were no stripped threads or alignment issues. Overall, I felt the quality of the desk and and the fit and finish of the parts were excellent and exceeded my expectations.The motor operates pretty quietly, and raises and lowers the desk just fine, even with a bunch of stuff piled on top of it (I don't plan on testing what its limits are - it holds what I need). I had an error message pop up on the controller once when I attempted to recall a saved height, but unplugging the desk from power and reconnecting it resolved that. No issues since.The desk is solid and stable. At its higher settings it will sway a little bit when leaned on, but that's just physics at work - if you need something that's really solid at full height, get something with four legs instead of two.The only (minor) gripe that I have is that the cords could be a bit longer: the one for the control panel so you could reposition it if you needed to; and the power cord which barely reaches the width of the desk.I'm very pleased with this purchase. It met my budget, and exceeded my expectations. It's a good-looking, solid, quality desk. Hopefully it'll hold up over time - but so far, so good!"
"Desk was on sale and bought the Maple 55 inch.Ships in two shipments, the top and the motorized bottom.Not too bad to put together. Instructions are clear, however it does say to adjust the crossbar early on in instructions. But you aren't going to be able to do that until you are mounting to the top so you can line the holes up. So I would just ignore that step or make it a little wider to give you some working room.Once it comes time to mount the top  do one screw top/bottom on one side. Then loosen the crossbar and transmission rod and extend until until you lined up the other side with the holes.  Once all screwed in tighten the rod and crossbar.One thing I think would have helped was a guide on where the center of the crossbar extension was so you could extend it in a balanced way. I just eyeballed it. Most the weight is going to go to the legs anyway so not concerned.As far as predrilled holes go, they lined up perfectly on left/right side. There is no predrilled holes for the crossbar however you don't need a drill the wood is soft enough to just screw into with a bit of force.Theres also no predrilled hole for the back of the up/down switch but again not a problem. Theres plenty of holes to position the switch where you want (though it must be on the right side of the desk near the motor since the cords aren't that long).One other nitpick is the bracket that holds the power adapter doesn't lock into place. It just slides around freely. Being nitpicky though its not a functional problem.All pieces were there. The top looks really nice but it isn't heavy enough to be solid maple. But all put together the desk has good weight and very sturdy. Motor works well, I actually didn't even buy it for being a standing desk so thats a bonus. It was a good price even if it didn't have that feature.Pros:-sturdy and good weight to it-motor is enough to do the job.-not bad to put together. No frustrating moments. Takes about an hour. Only need a sturdy philips screwdriver no drill needed.-top is one solid piece-its deep! Most cheaper desks are 20-24 inches. 28 inches is a very noticeable difference.-good price-the desk gets very tall, I was surprised. I am 6'2 and it got more than tall enough for me.Cons-couple of nitpicks about instructionsWell see how long it lasts but so far am satisfied."
"This desk is a great value. I purchase two because we replaced our at home work station with these desk.It is great to alternate between sitting and standing. The motor is pretty quiet and the movement is very smooth going up and down.I have a laptop, monitor, some notebooks, and some charging dock on my desk and there is still plenty of space and the motor handles the weight well. The desk feels sturdy even when I lean my arms on the desk while in the standing position."
"I bought this few weeks ago and it's working great. The instrcutions to assemble this desk is very easy to follow. Nice and sturdy desk. I would recommend this product. In fact, I recommended to one of my friend and he also bought it. Good one for that discounted price."

Good product
"I checked reviews before buying this desk, because it is a lot cheaper than I can get locally and I wondered about the quality. I agree with reviewers who like it. It was pretty easy to assemble, and the instructions are a lot better than I'd get from Ikea. I didn't attach the hooks because I don't need them.I suggest testing the mechanism before you install the baffle plates and turn the desk the right way up. I didn't, and had to turn it over again and remove the baffle plates to fix the mechanism, because I had not pushed the rod properly into the motor and only one leg was moving.All in all, a nice looking and well built riser desk at a good price."
"Does it have all the bells and whistles? No, but it has much more than some at half the price. In addition to those little touches like the side hook and collapsible organizer, everything else from packaging to the quality of material and even assembly were easy and stress free. The legs of the table are a thin metal making them lightweight and more modern, the tabletop is clearly cheaper material with a painted varnish in the gray that I chose, but it still feels nice and sturdy, as individual pieces and once they're all put together.The box came and actually showed the best way to unpack, inside it was packed well to the point where even though I used the box cutter to open it, I did not have to worry about scratching the table surface. I unpacked everything, the instructions were there And we're very straightforward. The pictures said everything it had the list of things that we needed laid out, And because of the easy way everything was laid out and explained, I had this put together in 35 minutes (though probably would have been 25 had on it been constantly distracted by my nosy dog lol).I had to pick this up and move it to the room it was going in (in part because there's no room to build it in that room), but the desk was lightweight but still sturdy and fit perfectly in the space I needed. I haven't piled anything heavy on the desk yet, so I can't speak to durability and the promised weight of what I believe was 110lb that it's supposed to be able to hold, but it feels really solid and it looks really nice in the space I chose. I don't know if I'll ever actually end up testing out the weight considering what I plan on using this desk for, but I think it's worth the price for sure, I think I paid $50 and it's a much better quality than some stuff I bought here on Amazon for $20-$40 more. There's definitely nicer things on Amazon, but between how sleek and modern it looks, the price and, depending on what you're using it for, I think this is well worth the choice."

This desk offers a perfect blend of aesthetics, functionality, and convenience, making it an ideal choice for both gaming and professional work.Assembly:The assembly process was a breeze, taking me approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete.

I appreciated the inclusion of one extra piece for each screw and an additional foot pad, showcasing the manufacturer's attention to detail.Design:The vintage design of the desk caught my eye, and I must say it looks even better in person. The color options available are a nice touch, allowing customers to choose a style that suits their preferences. The desk is spacious, providing plenty of room for a dual-monitor setup, and it exudes a sturdy and reliable build.Functionality:One standout feature is the convenient storage bag on the side, offering a handy solution for keeping essentials within arm's reach. The addition of a headphone hook is a thoughtful touch, keeping my workspace organized and clutter-free.

For under $100 this desk is pretty good. It’s great if you need to save space but want a nice small desk for two monitors. I purchased the 48 inch version and the two monitors in the photo are both 27” curved so they are a bit large for this desk. The desk is sturdy and was super quick to install.If you’re going to use two monitors on this desk I would recommend getting two 24” displays. If you get two 27” displays like I did make sure to use a monitor stand that can bring the monitors close together or put one vertically otherwise one monitor will slightly be off the desk. However if you don’t mind the look of one monitor going past the desk length then it’s great.
"I bought this desk for my living room so I had a place to keep my laptop and a few notebooks.  It's the perfect size, looks really nice and minimalist, and is great for everyday use.  The side pouch holds a large notebook, my big happy planner, and usually a stack of mail very easily.  The top of the desk has my pencil holder, laptop, and a desk lamp and still has room for my notebook and my cup of coffee.  The assembly is very quick and easy as well.  Definitely recommend!"
"Sturdy desk. It was easy to put together and I have used it many times over the nearly 2 years that I have had this desk. Worth the money and a solid desk. Its not heavy, so its perfect to move around as needed for my laptop. Love!"
"Perfect for my combo office-guest room. Very open design so, though it’s a big desk, it doesn’t look overwhelming in a room that also has a full-sized bed, a file cabinet, and a bookshelf. I love the marbled look of the top. It has a mat finish with just a little texture to it, so it’s not shiny or slippery, but is still smooth enough to use as a writing surface. Super easy to put together solo. It came with 2 allen wrenches (brilliant if you’re working with a partner on assembly) and extra parts. You’ll see in the pic that I put the hook on to face under the desk and use it to keep my surge protector/power strip and cords off the floor. And bonus, it got here about a week sooner than I expected! (3d vs 7-10 that was estimated.) I’m totally satisfied with this purchase."
"I was very pleasantly surprised how good quality this desk! Super easy to put together, strong structure, and nice looking! Would recommend as the perfect desk for small areas! Love the size organizer, which you can put on either side!"
"great to work, eat  or read table for all. It this one purchased for top  elderly as a table for her recliner.Simple assembly even for me as 81 yr old."
"I bought this desk to match the rest of my room with the gold and white. Very hard to find a decent desk with those colours in this price range.It was easy to install and the table top is more solid than I was expecting, but the legs are very thin compared to the photo online. Only downside."
