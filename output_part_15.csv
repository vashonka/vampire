"This is basically the card game Spoons, but more extravagant and crazy and we love it! Takes a while to inflate and deflate and the burritos are pretty big, but we'll worth it! Easy for young children to learn and play."
"This board game is alot of fun, all parts came intact and it's very vibrant!"
My son is turning 8 and we tried playing Monopoly for a few hours before he completely lost interest. I bought this game in hopes of a lighter experience and it was everything I remembered. It took about an hour and a half to get through to the end but it was eventful and kept his attention. I like the updated career cards. We have already played it twice!
"I bought this game for my daughter for her birthday and our family had a fun time playing together. There are some rules I don't remember having when I played this back in the 90's, and those changes actually make the game more fun.  We enjoyed the updates and got a lot of good laughs out of how ""Life"" turned out for each of us.I do wish it had a couple more cars, so that more people could play. We are a family of 5, so we opted to have one family member just do the ""bank"" job while we played together, but it would be even better if I could purchase extra cars and ""people"" for the game."
Tried to duplicate the old game of life. It’s a good game with modern twist but wish it was just like the original I remember!
Was really impressed with the packaging. Game arrived in perfect condition. This is a favorite game and we love to gift it to friends.
Love it
"the game is easy for the kids to pickup and learn, best part is all the features allow for quick setup and allow them to learn about the purpose of life. It allows us to have lots of family time and with the roles they can explore different career paths. One of the more purposeful games that never gets old. Also a great gift for anybody 5 or above."
Easy to play
"Just what my nephew wanted. He loves it. Fast delivery, product is great too. Thank you"
"The right amount of learning curve to just have fun and not get bored or frustrated.  The art is beautiful, and it was interesting reading information on all of the parks."
"I LOVE this game.  It is well made, fun and different than your typical board game.  I even learned a few things about our national parks.  The game tokens are nicely made and worth the money.  It took a little time to run through all the rules, which my teenage niece read through them for us, but once that is done, it's fun and challenging!"
"Received Trekking The National Parks board game as a Christmas gift from my husband, and it has been a lot of fun.As National Park lovers, this board game has quickly become a favorite in our household. The combination of fast-paced gameplay, strategic elements, and the educational aspect of learning about national parks resonates well with us, as we are real-life park fans ourselves. Also, cool to see the inspiration behind the game.We've played it with adult family members (ages 20 to 54) and it has been a blast. The game is easy to learn, ensuring everyone can dive into the adventure without unnecessary complexities. The fact that it's suitable for kids aged 10 and up makes it a versatile choice for family game nights.What's truly impressive is that despite its simplicity, the game doesn't lose its charm. We haven't grown tired of it, and each playthrough offers a unique experience as we explore different national parks.Highly recommended for those who enjoy a quick, engaging, and educational board game experience. It has been a great addition to the game collection and a good substitute for Catan if you like that game and want to switch things up!"
"This game is fun for adults and kids.  It does take about an hour to play, it depends on the strategy you use.  It was given as a gift, and was enjoyed by everyone.  I would recommend this game, and would buy it again as a gift or for myself."
My wife likes it but there is just too many way to gain points and it's kinda annoying at the end who won but overall game design is great and fun to learn about all national parks.
"I gave this to my parents because they love traveling to national parks. They love it! It's so fun, we love that there are so many ways you can try to play it, like methods to win - you can focus on beads, parks, campsites, blocking people XD The best way is typically a mix of all the things, you have to really multitask and be flexible based on what everyone else is doing.It's a high quality game, fun and beautiful board and cards and pieces, and I love the information! The cards have details about the different parks. It really makes you want to go visit them! Gives my parents ideas for which they want to see next, or again! So fun to play it with them, really good for people who are outdoorsy and enjoy going to places like that."
This was fun to play and learned a lot along the trails.
Love this game! Fun for the whole family and very high quality workmanship.
"Nice quality board and accessories, and an engaging, educational array of national park information on the cards.  Our first game took longer than usual as we were learning.  We plan to watch the video on game play to make sure we have interpreted the instructions correctly, but it's a good game.  I think many board games are too expensive though, including this one, but the quality is there."
"This game is really fun for 2 people (probably for more as well but so far just me and my partner). It's easy to get a hold of the rules and it's fun competition. The game ends quite quickly when people collect 5 National parks, so to make it more fun me and my partner remove this rule and play until all stones are collected."
Fantastic service and great product.
My kids all love Pictionary and it‚Äôs such a great family time game! Easy enough for my 12 yo to know what most of the items are and fun for the adults too!
Fun classic for the family. Can be tough to find a pop topic card relevant enough for younger players but still great fun.
"I love the game, but find the boards that come with it too tiny - would prefer a bigger board and an easel, as it used to be"
"Like many reviews say, the game is great, easy and fun to play for my 10 and 7 year olds, but the markers are an absolute mess. We had wet baby wipes with us and we still all ended up with dark stains in our hands that won‚Äôt go away after washing and scrubbing. I‚Äôm just hoping it won‚Äôt transfer to the bedsheets at the night due to body heat. I‚Äôm getting regular whit board markers with a dry eraser next time we play. Or paper and pencil. Whichever."
This is a great game
"Made of good quality, and a fun game"
Loved this game as a kid had friends over they were reluctant at first then had so much fun the insist on us bringing it to our next dinner!
"Great game. Quality of markers and board are not great.Like many reviews say, the game is great, easy and fun to play with kids, but the markers are an absolute mess. We had wet baby wipes with us and we still all ended up with dark stains in our hands that won‚Äôt go away after washing and scrubbing.  I‚Äôm getting regular whit board markers with a dry eraser next time we play. Or paper and pencil. The marker is tough to come off skin."
Bought it as a game to play with my elderly grandpa and we have so much fun.
Good quality
"I'd forgotten how much fun this game is. We played with an 8 year old, 11 year old, 41 year old and a 68 year old and everyone had a great time! üòÅ The reusable cards and markers are a good idea, but very clumsy to actually use, particularly cleaning them each time. Many of the clues are unnecessarily abstract, but we just skipped those."
ALL IS GOOD
I shopped  around and this was well priced! Came in less than 24 hours!!
"Very quick to learn and quick to play, but takes some serious observation of what you can do and what your opponents have done to develop a (flexible) winning strategy. Good for both beginners and experienced gamers, and shouldn't take more than 30-40 minutes to play.I recommend getting sleeves for the cards (2.5""x3.5"" ""poker"" sized) because they will get used a lot. I'm not a big fan of the chips, but most people seem to like them and they are certainly much better than the cardboard chits you would have expected to get with most boardgames.The artwork is nice, but the theme feels pasted on. They could have made this with no artwork at all and it would have played exactly the same (and been just as much fun).The mechanics are relatively simple: you have a tableau of cards laid out, 4 each from 3 different decks. The cards from the I deck are the cheapest to buy and the least valuable, worth 0 or 1 point for victory; the cards from the II deck cost more and are worth 1-3 points; and the cards from the III deck are the most expensive to buy and the most valuable, worth 3-5 points each. Cards you purchase are played face up in front of you and give you a permanent discount thereafter, so purchasing a white diamond card (for example) gives you a permanent discount of 1 white for all future purchases. The price of a card is in the lower left, and cards are purchased with any combination of the right color cards and gem tokens. Thus, if a card costs 5 green to purchase, you could purchase it with 5 green tokens, the discount from 5 previously purchased green cards, 3 tokens and the discount from 2 previously purchased cards, etc. A gold joker token is ""wild"" and can be used in place of any color in the price on a one-to-one basis, so in the above example you could buy the card with 2 green gem tokens, discount from 2 previously purchased green cards, and a gold joker token.Purchased cards are replaced immediately from the appropriate deck, and gem tokens used to purchase a card are returned immediately to the supply/bank.If you purchase cards of the appropriate colors, either 4 each of 2 specific colors or 3 each of 3 specific colors, you get a ""visit"" from a ""noble."" This simply means you collect the appropriate noble tile. Nobles are worth 3 points each.On each turn, you take one of three actions: purchase a card that is face up or that you have previously reserved; reserve a card to your hand so that only you may purchase it on a later turn; or collect gem tokens. You may only reserve a card up to a total of 3 in hand, and the only way to clear a reserved card out of your hand is to purchase it on a later turn. If there are any gold jokers available, you get one when you reserve a card; this is the only way to get a gold joker token. To collect gem tokens, you may take 2 of a same color if at least 2 of that color would be left in the supply after you take yours (at least 4 present before you take your 2), or you can take 1 each of 3 different colors. If you have more than 10 tokens (gems and jokers) at the end of your turn, you must immediately discard down to 10 total. (There are a few edge cases to read up on, but that's the basic gameplay.)The game is played until at least 1 player reaches 15 points. When that happens, the current round is finished out so that everyone has had an equal number of turns, then the player with the most points wins. In a tie, whomever purchased the fewest cards wins the tiebreaker.The strategy lies in planning out how to get the cards and/or tokens you need for future purchases, identifying the cards your opponent is hoping to purchase, and controlling the very limited supply of tokens and visible cards by buying/collecting/reserving what your opponent wants or needs. You cannot directly attack an opponent; once a card is purchased, she has it permanently; once she collects gem tokens, she has them until she chooses to spend them. It is all a matter of forward thinking, preparing for your future card purchases and impeding or obstructing your opponent's intended future card purchases.The deck III cards have a uniform distribution of costs and values among the 5 card colors; the deck II and I cards do not.It's simple to understand, quick to set up, quick to play, fun to look at, fun to handle the tokens (chips), and most importantly, fun to play. The only random element is shuffling the 3 decks and the nobles before set up; it's basically all decisions after that.Bottom line: does it play well? Yes it does. Can you teach and play quickly? Yes you can. Will it still be as fun on the 50th play? Yes it will (is). Does it give good value for your entertainment dollar? Yes it does. Some people have called it a ""filler"" game, which is a special term among gamers meaning you can set up and play fairly quickly, without major strategy time/planning required, and still have fun. I also like to describe it as a ""gateway"" game, which means it can draw people who who usually don't think of themselves as gamers into the scene. It hits that sweet spot of affordable, quick, fun, non-cutthroat, with meaningful decisions, for many people.Edit: I personally don't like the tokens. They are better than the cardboard you would usually expect in a boardgame, but I find it's a little more fun for us to use ""pirate"" coins Pirate Dubloons, Set of 5 Replica Coins for the gold joker tokens, and acrylic ""pirate"" gems Jumbo Adhesive Jewels (100 pc) for the gem tokens. I am not 100% satisfied with the acrylic gems for this purpose, but the coins are perfect."
"splendor is a fun easy to learn family game.  The game time is about 30 to 45 minutes.  This is an engine builder game where each player increases their wealth in a strategy to purchase cards that win the game.  Everything about this game is high-quality, including the game board the texture feel and density of the tokens the cards have amazing art and durable, as well as the box and storage compartments that come with it.  We played this game with people ranging from nine years old to 50 years old and all have an equal chance of winning played right.  The game is easy to set up. The instructions are clearly labeled and easy to follow."
"We know this game is very highly recommended game in the world, still this is very fantastic game more than we thought.It needs strategy but not so difficult - so we think we can enjoy this game for a long time.We also ordered 2 more games, and all products came to us without any harms.Thank you!"
"My kids love this game and I don't hate playing it with them! Game takes about half hour, pieces are good quality. It says for ages 10 and up but my smart 7 year old plays perfectly well and wins also. Great game, enjoyed by all."
"This game is so fun and simple to learn and play. It can be set up in about a minute or less and has everything you need to play. A 2 player game can go as quick as 10-15 minutes. For 3 and 4 player games I would add at least 5-7 minutes per player. The game is easy to play but there's enough strategy to make it very interesting. You need to pay attention to what the other players are buying and what they possess, as all items and values must be shown at all times. There's no interaction between players, but you can try to reserve or buy cards that will restrict other players' options.There are 5 different gem tokens that are used, which have printed graphics on a thick plastic chip, and a 6th, a ""joker"" that is a wildcard that can substitute for the other 5 colors of gems. On your turn you can select a certain number of gems to take, reserve a card from the table to buy later (which also gives you 1 joker token), or buy a card using the gems in your possession. The cards give you bonuses to your gem counts, so if you buy a card with a ruby bonus, you can add that to your total of ruby gem tokens you have. This makes buying future cards that require rubies easier to buy. Some of the cards have prestige (victory) points, which are needed to win the game. There are also 3 nobles who will visit you if you have the required gem bonuses in your collection, which will give you more prestige points. When a player reaches 15 prestige points, the current round is completed so that every player gets an equal number of turns. At the end of this final round, the player with the most prestige points wins.The plastic insert keeps everything in it's place and neatly stored. The 3 levels of development cards and the tokens have their own slots to help with organization and setup. There are suggested rules for 2 players and 3-4 players. The art is on each piece is excellent, and helps with the theme. The box, cards, gem tokens, and noble tiles are all high quality. The noble tiles are printed on thick cardboard and the development cards aren't very textured but not flimsy.This game can also appeal to non-gamers due to the simple rules and quick play time."
"Great game, Quick to learn, sturdy component construction."
"This is the best game we've found in years. We've given it to several other families and they all love it too. It's just really flexible and accessible.It's easy and fairly quick to set up. Each game is not super long. It works well with 2, 3 or 4 players. It's not overly complicated so it's fun for casual game players but it has enough strategy to keep more focused people entertained."
"We love this game. The playing tokens have some weight to them, they're nice."
"arrived good condition, but it is the old version, not 2024 version.  ordered as gift in South Africa"
"Terrible quality of materials, the cards and chips are made of cheap and thin paper.But it's enough to play neatly"
"We love this game!  The game takes about 30 minutes to play, which is perfect for maintaining interest. It is a game of luck and strategy. Our grandchildren (aged 9 to 11) can play - and win - so it can be enjoyed by the whole family. It is easy to play but once you have played it a few times, you begin to develop diabolical strategies to beat your opponents.  Beware, as it can become addictive and it can leave you seething with resentment when your opponent snatches victory just as you thought you had it in the bag!"
"At first I was scared if it would be a good product or duplicate but then I ordered and now I m well satisfied and its really so much fun to play with frnds,and it can be played up to 4 from two to players!totally recommend it"
Great game and well made for the price. Fun for family and teens! Easily stored.
We did played this for family game night with a group of friends and boy did it become competitive!  And hilarious!  Also played it with coworkers during our annual onsite meeting.  Great game to get people involved!
Very fun game! Definitely need to be somewhat sober to play otherwise it gets confusing!Easy to understand the rules tho!
This was a hit at game night! Instructions were quick and we were able to play immediately. Games go pretty fast. Using two teams was perfect. One team does the challenge while the other team listens for rules being broken. It was just as fun being the listening team. The phrases in game play ranged from easy to impossible so there was a good blend. Lots of laughs throughout!
"Such a fun game.  Played it for our girl’s night, eight of us.  Had a blast."
Lots of good laughs
We LOVE this game!! We played it for the first time on Thanksgiving and it was so much fun!! We are all very competitive and this game got pretty intense so it was perfect for us!! The instructions were clear and we were able to get to playing pretty quickly. I highly recommend this game for any family looking for a good laugh!!
We had fun playing this game!!
Delivered efficiently and in good condition.
It’s a great and funny game. I love it and best for family gatherings
"This game is SO MUCH FUN.  Family favorite by far.  Only down side is you run out of your guessing cards very quickly then it just becomes repetitive which can take the fun out of it.  So far I  can’t find any refills for the game, but it’s not hard to make up your own words either."
"Got the game, it was previously opened though. Hope all the pieces are here"
"We bought it for our granddaughter and it's been non-stop giggles ever since. The way it mimics your voice in that silly high-pitched tone is just hilarious, and the dancing? Forget about it. It's got some seriously groovy moves. The built-in songs are a cute touch, though I admit we mostly use the recording feature to make it repeat our own silly phrases. The LED lights add a fun, party vibe, especially in the dark. It's a bit loud, but hey, that's part of the charm!Honestly, this thing is worth every penny for the entertainment value alone. It's sturdy, the battery life is decent, and it's held up well to some enthusiastic toddler play. If you're looking for a fun, interactive toy that'll keep your little one (and let's be honest, the adults too) entertained, look no further than this dancing, talking cactus. It's a guaranteed hit!"
"This is a really fun toy for my 6 month old, it is a cute green color, the music quality on it is really good, easy to use, and it stands up on its own pretty well. Would make a great gift."
"What a great toy.  It listens and repeats whatever you're saying.  Kids will love it!  Heck, I love it.  It's easy to use & operate.  Great value.  Great for kids under 3 years old!!"
"Anyone else find it hilarious that the pre-programmed songs are obviously all stolen? Like it plays current and past pop hits, and some are remixed, but you can tell what the original is haha also, I will not be leaving my child unattended with this‚Äîit‚Äôs jerky and the fabric twists weird when it‚Äôs in use, so probably some hazards there. Otherwise, fun/gimicky toy to play with."
But the sound is very bad quality and it speaks spanish???
"This is good for young children. It helps the learn and hear themselves talk. They are fascinated by it. My son talks to it every second, my daughter follows too. Good buy. No regrets"
She loves it now and laughs. It is way too loud and annoying
"It worked for a couple hours and then stopped. With brand new batteries. It would turn on but I couldn‚Äôt even get it to play the music it came with. It could barely pick up my voice when it did work, unless I was practically yelling 6 inches from it. I regret buying it. It wasn‚Äôt working nearly as well as videos portrayed it to, even when it was actually ‚Äúworking‚Äù.Update: After I had posted my original review, the seller reached out to me and offered to replace it. I figured why not? I‚Äôd give it one more chance, and if the second one didn‚Äôt work I was completely done. Well, they replaced it and it showed up pretty quickly. The new one works perfectly! The kids absolutely love this thing. I would say it‚Äôs definitely worth it when it works properly!"
And SO darn annoying lol. Good thing it was a gift and I don't have to live with it. Works very well and picks up everything and repeats so careful if you're a grandma with a trucker mouth. Grandson loved it!
"My daughter loved it when she opened it up for Christmas but after 1 week it stopped working.Thank you for sending a new one, it's perfect no issues. Excellent customer service."
Was a hit at the Birthday Party all the kids/adults loved it. But annoying after a while.
I find the music too loud and it cannot be adjusted.
