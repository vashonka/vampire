"I bought this for my class. A RV works wonderful because the TVs that come with the camper the volumes are very loud and when you’re running your generator, it’s kind of hard to hear it a little bit but when I bought the sound bar because I can’t hear very well This is actually fantastic. I’m gonna buy one for my house too now worth the money. Very easy to hook up to your TV comes with instructions I would recommend"
"Plug in the HDMI and power cables into the back of the bar, place it close to your tv (mine’s a Fire tv) then plug the HDMI into the back of the tv and the power into the plug then just turn on the tv!  That was it!  My Fire tv remote controls the power and volume.  Easy Peazy!  The tv sounds fine without it for me but the soundbar makes it sound even better!"
"This soundbar offers excellent value for its price. The materials and build quality are solid, and the connectivity is straightforward. The volume control on the front works effectively, and it’s surprisingly loud given its compact size. If you're looking for an affordable speaker for everyday tasks, this is a great option.Best For:- YouTube- Podcasts- Conference calls (speaker only)- Similar activitiesNot Recommended For:- Music- Movies- Immersive gamingWhile this speaker is decent overall, the primary factor in my rating is audio quality, as it is, after all, a speaker.  The sound is clear and loud, making it suitable for filling a room or listening to spoken content.  However, when it comes to enjoying a movie, music, or immersive gaming, you’ll notice it lacks depth in both the upper and lower ranges.  I own several speakers across various price points, and while I’d use this one for meetings, YouTube, or podcasts, it doesn’t deliver the rich audio experience you might want for other activities."
"Easy set-up, great sound, multiple connections--great and easy sound in an attractive case!!"
The sound quality is quite good. Speakers work great. Sound separated well. It was easy to set up. Seems well built.
We like the sound of this sound bar. It’s better than the TV sound alone. We may get one for the TV in the bedroom. Easy to set up.
"Easy setup, good size. 10/10Sound Quality 5/10, you get what you paid for.It's not something I would get for myself.Check other brands."
The sound quality is superb. Left and right speakers work great. Almost like surround sound. It was very easy to set up. Hopefully it will last for a long time.
At low volumes it is not that great. It goes in and out with volume pitches. But at high volumes it sounds great
"It was very easy to wall mount these speakers as they are light weight. Multiple connection options is convenient for connecting multiple devices. When you want to play music from your phone all you need is to do is to switch the device. The remote looks and feels cheap, but it gets the job done. The color perfectly blends with the TV."
I bought this when I upgraded to bigger smart tv.  The sound quality is excellent.  Before this product I had to turn on subtitles when I watched movies on Tv as the sound quality was not good.  But with this product the sound is so clear and crisp I don’t need to turn on sound titles.  Also very good to hear music.The only problem I have with Sonos is their app which is horrible.
"This is my 3rd Beam Gen 2 soundbar each now connected to Samsung flat screen tv's.  In order to setup I called Samsung customer service who took the time to help me thru getting my Samsung tv to recognize the new Sonos Beam soundbar along with the tv remote. I had downloaded to my iPhone the Sonos app but for those who are new to Sonos you will need to download the app. The app is the bridge to hearing  the sound from the Samsung tv coming thru the Beam Gen 2 soundbar.  The Sonos is where the soundbar is registered, recognized, and completes the connection to hear the sound coming out of the soundbar. Just as a side note, the Sonos Beam Gen 2 does not come with a remote but does have a short length audio wire should it be needed, I did not have need of.  I do recommend as a gift to yourself or for a person who would appreciate having a quality soundbar.  If possible purchase on sale."
Solid design.  Doesn’t take a lot of room.  Sounds much bigger than it looks.  From my research getting the mini subwoofer will take this little guy to another level.  I’m going to be purchasing it soon
"This product relies completely on an app you must load. There is no remote, nor is there any real way to control it without first connecting to an app. My phone was able to find the device, but then it required connection to a wifi signal. That is where the wheels came off. Apparently it can only connect to a 2.4GHz signal. My typical signal is 5Ghz. I did turn on a 2.4 just so I could connect but it still would not in the app. My network showed the device, but the app kept failing. No app, no functionality. calling support landed me a 35min wait and online help showed basically there is nothing you can do. So this item is immediately being returned.I can't stress enough how stupid this design is. If you have a product that relies 100% on the app, then the app better work. I will never waste time with a sonos system again. If I could give this zero stars, I would. I wasted two hours trying to get this to work and get someone on the phone."
I normally don’t write reviews unless the product goes way beyond expectations. This is one truly amazing sound bar. Easy to set up and crisp sound. The sound is a bit mind blowing in the fact it produces sounds that appear to be coming from different parts of the room. Movies such as Dune sound so good it’s like watching a different movie. Games such as Halo are mesmerizing but you have to do a little setup with your Xbox…no fault of Sonos. I do not recommend the bar if you are limited to only an optical cable. To get the full benefits of the bar I strongly recommend a TV with ARC / eARC. Great for smaller rooms and 55 inch and under TV.  Bottom line this sound bar sounds better than many home theater systems.
"We bought a Beam (gen 2) soundbar and an Era 300 on sale recently.  While the instructions are clear, he This would be 5 stars except the APP is glitchy and not as intuitively user friendly ( unless you're a software engineer!).  During initial setup the AP stopped with error message ""unable to register product.""  After 3 attempts (two hours) it stayed with the message.  FORTUNATELY , we had a friend of our neighbors who worked for Sonos and he was great at walking through it - finally had to do factory reset on both units and then was able to proceed.  Did advanced tuning for each room - and the sound quality of these units is unbelievably good.  We had a small portable Bose speaker - this is a long overdue step up!  Once set up you wont regret it!  Just be patient......"
Phenomenal sound absolutely love it
"Tried a Bose it stopped working after a few days ,returned it and got the Sonos for my LG TV ,was advised by Bose thy have a problem connecting to LG TV's"
"I’m really impressed with the Sonos Beam Gen 2. It’s compact and fits seamlessly with my room setup without taking up much space.Setup was incredibly easy. The Sonos app guided me through every step, so I had it up and running in minutes. The sound quality is where it truly shines, though! Even without upfiring speakers, the Dolby Atmos makes it feel like sound is coming from all around, and dialogue is crystal clear. It’s perfect for movie nights.I also appreciate the connectivity options. HDMI eARC means I get the best audio quality, and it integrates effortlessly with my other Sonos speakers, so expanding my setup down the road will be a breeze. Plus, having Alexa and Google Assistant built-in adds a ton of convenience—I can control the soundbar with just my voice!Overall, the Beam Gen 2 is a fantastic addition to my home entertainment. If you’re looking for an upgrade that’s powerful but compact, I highly recommend it."
"Sound for TV and music is great, recommend adding the small sub to complete the set up. Big difference in experience watching TV Shows and Movies"
"I bought this as a quirky activity to do after work, and it’s turned out to be a great way to unwind. The theme is goofy, and I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did, but here I am, recommending it! The pieces fit really well, and the quality is top-notch—no puzzle dust, which is a huge plus for me. It’s not overly challenging, but just enough to keep me entertained while giving my brain a break. This puzzle is a keeper!"
"Working it little by little… funny fact, all the dogs are pooping and there are actually poops in the puzzle.L O L."
This is the best funny gift for avid puzzleperson. Can hardly wait  to see them open on Chistmas!
This puzzle is a great way to pass time. The companies customer service is 10 stars. When we first started on it we discovered that one of the border pieces wasn’t there. I called them and without question they sent another one and we were able to complete it. It took 10 days to finish.
Great for a white elephant gift. We couldnt stop laughing at all of the dogs

"This puzzle was fun because it is very different from other puzzles. It will challenge you ,all the pieces are the same shape ,but the pieces are thick and cut perfect with no catches on them. The colors are vivid which helps with separating puzzle pieces and helps with the difficulty of putting it together."
Bought this for my sister for Christmas. We are always plating jokes on each other. I can't wait to give it to her. I know she will love it.
"We always do a puzzle together over Christmas as a family, and this year was especially fun with this one! The quality of the puzzle was good."
Lots of fun doing this one
I loved the puzzle that I bought for my son
"Prompt, good communication, good price."
"I love the concept, but the image quality is poor. The bottom section of the puzzle is pretty clear, but the top section is fuzzy and pixelated. The pieces are quite poorly made, many of the pieces seem to be the same shape and fit into other similar pieces, the only way to double check for pieces of the same color is to flip them on the back and see if they printing on the back lines up. Way overpriced for the quality (I see a similar/same pooping dogs puzzle listed on Amazon for half the price and the print on the box looks the same), which is more reasonable considering the poor quality of the print and fit of the pieces."
Not only is the puzzle itself beautiful but the pieces are sturdy and thick fit together easily and cleanly and have a beautiful Sheen to them. The puzzle has imprinted numerical codes on the back so you can put it together in sections if you choose. All together this was one of prettiest puzzles I have ordered and probably will hang it on the wall eventually. The stained glass effect is quite impressive. This is a great puzzle for such a low price!
"Challenging, sturdy puzzle. Took me 6 days to complete. A relaxing project to do before bed. Comes with a poster which is helpful. Variety of colors. All the pieces were included. Cardboard is thin but sturdy- ends don‚Äôt fray and I was able to pick up the whole puzzle as you see in picture 1. Worth the money."
"I love working 1000 piece puzzles and this one was a doozie!  It does have the quadrant markings in the back of each piece, but i don't use those. The colors are beautiful and it's just hard enough to make your brain work a bit more than usual. Very pretty, high quality pieces and packaging."
i will stick to 500 piece.  But I like the fact that they have letters on the back to help.  It‚Äôs taking me a while to put it together.  This is a beautiful puzzle.
"A good challenge, but a relaxing way to spend rainy evenings. Excellent quality."
I loved the alphabet system on the back for each section made putting together a bit easier.  I have framed it an it is a beautiful piece over my bed.  I wish I could find more like this for the price!
Fun project but disappointed that 2 pieces are missing
The quality of the pieces is incredible. It's gorgeous!
"Bought quite a few puzzles lately and enjoying them all. This one is quite beautiful! Not super hard, but not boringly easy either."
It was afun puzzle to put together. No missing pieces.  This year 3 of 8 puzzles by Buffalo games has been missing pieces.
Buffalo Games makes the best puzzles that I've ever done. They come in so many cool designs and are really sturdy. They make a huge range from very easy puzzles and very hard puzzles. Never buying puzzles from another brand again.
"It was fun to build and the scene is interesting and different. The image is very clean and the pieces fit very well and hold together. I started at the top and worked down this time. When I finished the stars, sky, trees and mountains I thought that was probably the 'hard part'. Oh no. For me the lower half of the picture was much more work. I didn't mind, but was a bit of a surprised. I thought I'd be able to knock that part off quickly. ;-)"
Love doing this puzzle. Lots of beautiful colors
"This was my first puzzle in decades.  It was VERY challenging because it was 1000 pieces, but it looks absolutely amazing with great colors and clarity.  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!  My wife and I look forward to doing more puzzles like this together"
"This was a beautiful puzzle! the pieces fit together great, and were of good quality, but one piece was missing completely and 3 others did not fit. They were the correct color like they should go in those places but the shape is not correct."
Love the Gorgeous picture. So nice to put together.
I have 5 edges pieces missing
"This was a very enjoyable puzzle! I was able to complete it without looking at the picture because there were so many unique objects, and the pieces fit well and were not identical in shape or color. It was very satisfying to put together the pretty scene."
"This puzzle is very challenging, but I am gradually getting it done. Due to repeated shapes, some pieces will fit together where they do not belong. There is also much similarity in the colors which makes it difficult to distinguish correct placement without carefully examining the picture.  If you enjoy a challenge, this puzzle is for you.."
"This puzzle was fun to do. My wife and I put several pieces in the wrong place, and they looked correct. It wasn't until we had a couple of pieces that would not fit in the area that we were working. making us reexamine our work. We have never had a puzzle that allowed us to get so far with an incorrect piece in place. If you like a good challenge this puzzle is for you."
"10/10, gorgeous. Extremely challenging. Took us (two mid-20 year olds) two months to complete after we purchased when we got COVID. I loved the challenge lol, but I also had multiple “WHAT do you mean you DONT GO THERE?” And “how does this piece POSSIBLY fit in this puzzle?!”Highly recommend, but probably not if you want something easy. Also, can confirm it’s easily chewed up by animals… pieces still fit tho >_>"
"Was a nice jigsaw, very nice colors and good quality pieces"
"All pieces were included.  No noticeable dust.  I was very pleased with this puzzle.  I hadn't worked a puzzle in many years and enjoyed assembling this one.  It became much easier to assemble when I asked my kids for a puzzle table which they gifted to me.  Having the table made a huge difference.  The colors are vibrant just as pictured.  I took my time working this, not every day.  I simply enjoyed doing it."
I love puzzles and they are good for seniors also. Love it doing it.
This  puzzle delivered to me 9 Feb. is missing 1 puzzle piece and 2 pieces do not quite fit.  Disappointed to not be able to finish it.
This was a gd puzzle although the greenery was challenging as the artist used the same colours and brush strokes in many areas.  The print was clear. Another quality Buffalo Games jigsaw.
Puzzle difficulty. I can say 13 and up. The quality and the color palette is amazing. Unfortunately for some reason it was missing a piece
This was challenging puzzle and so beautiful. pieces we thin but fit together well. Would make a nice puzzle as a gift for an adult used to challenging puzzles.
The colors are very beautiful and realistic. It’s a good family time pas time. The quality is really nice as well.
"I have done MANY puzzles but this puzzle was ABSOLUTELY the most challenging.  It drove me bunkers and I LOVE IT! lol. If you want a challenge, this is the puzzle for you!"
"My husband and I do a lot of 1000 piece puzzles and are pretty good at them. There’s a lot of texture on many pieces, this puzzle kept us busy and provided a challenge! Took way longer than most puzzles we’ve done together but was beautiful when finished."
It was a challenge with the landscape of this scene.
This is not a simple just put in together puzzle. There is a challenge to it together. The picture has enough elements to it so it is not crazy.  The picture is beautiful and the pieces are sturdy.  It is a great puzzle.
"Great puzzle,  difficult enough to be challenging."
This is a beautiful puzzle. A bit difficult in some places. The pieces fit perfectly.
"Although this puzzle's picture was nice, the print was not as clear as the other Buffalo Games puzzles. It was quite grainy possibly due to the canvas lines of the image. These canvas lines are helpful if you are a first timer as they tell you which direction the piece goes. But if you are a seasoned puzzler, it spoils the enjoyment of putting the puzzle together."
I loved doing this 1000 piece puzzle. It was challenging and passed the time away.I am a Senior and puzzles have really helped me stay busy during our Winter months.
