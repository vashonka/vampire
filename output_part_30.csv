Love my Beautiful picture frame. It uploads very quickly and easy to upload photos.
This is my first device like this. It has all the basic functions you would expect. Easy to use app to upload. Videos buffer slightly that is the only real issue.
"Good value but as a purist the angle of view is a little restrictive so strategically position to view.  Didn't come with appropriate power plug but did have appropriate voltage transformer.  Amazon nor seller warned nor had algorithm to warn or upsell an adapter.  Delayed setting up.  Somewhat disappointing. ** EDIT: supplier has reached out, apologetic and have since sent out an appropriate adapter. ** The App' is a little clumsy but on the right path.  All up good value but expect not the smoothest learning curve.  I will buy a second to have a portrait and landscape choice.  The frame's software has nice feature where full frame or cropped images. I can recommend based on value."
Had to return as product never turned on.
"Didn’t know what to expect for the price. The frame design was really nice, not actually whitewashed wood, which I didn’t expect for the price, but it is very pretty and I was pleasantly surprised. Good quality. Perfect for what I needed."
"I wasn't sure if I was going to like these or not, turns out they're very nice. It is a very bright frame to better draw attention to the photo. I like how it was packaged because there was a cover on both sides of the glass. My 8x10 photo fit perfectly in there and it looks wonderful."
"Frames cute, sturdy but with plexiglass. Rare 4x4 size. Only complaint is the (sturdy) cardboard stand is short ie so frame doesn’t stand as upright as usual. But frame would hang and also props on a little easel-type stand just fine (and I can probably extend the cardboard stand if needed). Well packagesd, great instructions. Overall, just fine for the very low price for set of two."
Broke easily and the frame wasn’t correct size for the glass.  The glass moved easily and it broke easyThe manufacturer were unbelievably wonderful.  Got return my money and didn’t need to send it backExcellent customer serviceI think I had a bad egg.  I would try them again so they worth 5 stars
"Ordered these frames as part of a gift, not sure what to expect in terms of quality.  They arrived quickly, they were easy prep for the card I was framing, and once finished, they looked great.  I recently saw the cards I framed and gave as gifts hanging on the way of my friends home and they both looked perfect.  Excellent price, good quality, fast service.  I would order these again for sure.  ** Note, there is not glass as part of the frame, it's heavy, clear plexiglass type material.  However, hanging on the wall, you could not tell the difference at all."
"These shipped extremely quick and arrived as expected. Even though the clear protection is only plastic, you can't tell unless you go up really close. It wasn't a negative factor to me as it made the frames lighter and easier to hang up.The white paint was just a wee thin and dark for me - it was more gray. But that wasn't too big a deal as the distressed is supposed to be natural and have thar randomized color effect.Overall, really easy to set up with my pictures and just really uniform and beautiful. LOVE the mats and the width they used because it didn't cut into integral parts of my pictures like other matting does.Great frames! Highly recommend!!!"
"Cheap frame, you’re getting what you paid for, plexiglass is thin/flexible. Is NOT for table top use, wall mount only, does not have stand only hooks for hanging."
"At first I wasn't sure what to think about plastic rather than glass on the front, but that made these frames ideal for shipping cross country, and I even used the same, well-designed cardboard box they came it.Also the frames are a nice faux-weathered finish."
"The product was not very sturdy and was not what I thought, but the cost reflected the product. my won mistake."
This is a sturdy frame and very attractive.
"Nice wood frame, sturdy and value for the money."
"I have ordered at least 8 of these frames. They are well-made. I like the choice of colors. However, at least two of them came with glass broken. They were package in plastic bags and not boxes, although I requested boxes. Amazon was quick to replace the frames, though."
Thought it would be faded or not put together well. Exceeded my expectations as it is a very beautiful piece
No complaints with this frame! Sometimes distressed products can look cheap or like they have been worn through use versus looking the part. This still looks like a never before used frame with the distressed accents. Easy to remove backing and place picture in. The stand is sturdy and doesnt allow the frame to lean back too far
"I mean it's a frame, that you put a photo in. It worked!"
Just received the Lawrence White Wash Maple Frame.  It is absolutely beautiful!  I just added matting and am using it to frame engagement photos for a bridal shower gift.
Bought one of these for a desktop position. The arm that holds the picture up right was so flimsy the picture ended up pointing more to the ceiling then at you. Returned it and bought another one thinking it might just be a bad batch.The second one had the same problem plus there were marks along one side of the frame. Looked like it wasn't stained properly.Not worth the money. Very poor quality.
these picture frames are amazing!! the plexiglass is perfect keeps me from having to worry about them falling and breaking with our dog running around. they don‚Äôt feel cheap at all either so totally worth the price! they are super easy to hang and made my dream of how i wanted my wedding pictures hung perfect!
"I needed an inexpensive, but ‚Äúgreat looking‚Äù way update, and display, various family photos, with a common ‚Äútheme‚Äù. (I didn‚Äôt want the look of mismatched photo frames.)These ‚ÄúHappyHapi 5x7 Picture Frames, 18 Pack Photo Frame‚Äù set got the job done!The wood frames came well packed, with each frame individually wrapped. The frames are well made ‚Äì meeting at a true 90 degrees, in each corner. Nice!Overall, the ‚Äú5x7 Picture Frames, 18 Pack‚Äù is an easy, great looking, cost-effective way, to display the photos that matter the most to you!Recommended!"
"These are pretty good quality for the price. They are not the most durable frames in the world, but way better than the dollar tree. I think the quality for the price is well worth it. Note it is plastic and not glass."
"Quality frame, easy to hang up, I like the plastic instead of glass."
"These frames are durable feeling, the cover isn‚Äôt glass which is helpful in a house full of boys. They look nice and come with awesome Wall hooks for hanging.My frames don‚Äôt fit flush against the wall when using the wall hooks provided but, they still look great and are secure."
"Great photo frames and super sturdy. Fits photos as expected and can be matted or not depending on preference. Thick plastic material used for this instead of glass, but still clear picture. Definitely a good value for the price."
"Wrapped well, none were broken. Decent quality, film on both sides to protect the glass. Used for family photos for parents in childcare center and they were very pleased! So convenient to buy in bulk! Was a lightning deals so very happy!"
"These frames worked for what I needed them for. Unfortunately I didn't read the fine print and was not aware that they aren't glass.... It's plexiglass. Not my favorite and probably wouldn't have ordered if I read that part. Pretty cheap material, but you get what you pay for. Probably would've returned if I didn't live in such a remote place with long wait times for packages. Otherwise, they get the job done."
I'm very impressed with this frame. I bought this frame for our church to put a photo in. I was surprised at the quality and the weight of the frame. Definitely not cheap and lightweight! Will buy more from my own house. I love that it has a beautiful vintage look to it as well
"The frames are beautiful, perfect for my daughter‚Äôs graduation pic üôåüèΩ frames are sturdy and nicely made. Great deal"
"Definitely looks more expensive than it is, love the rich gold color as well!"
"Bought these for three The New Yorker cover art prints. The combination of the art's colors and style with the frame's true, rich gold tone, design and width of frame is perfectly stunning. Overall great quality and price. I'm very happy with this product and will highly recommend to anyone."
"This frame is beautiful. Never mind the fact that it's plastic. It is well made, very sturdy, and the finish is really nice. It looks like an expensive frame. It also has a glass pane."
"CON: The supplied wall hanging feature was totally useless!PRO: The wood frame is not only good-looking, but allowed me to manually attach eye screws and picture hanging wire to achieve the finished look!"
"I am not typically a fan of gold frames but I needed to buy one to match a gift I purchased. I looked at several frames and read many reviews. After much time and consideration, I chose this frame. I am very happy with my choice. The frame is well built, it is high quality. It was packaged well and the gift looks absolutely perfect inside this frame. No other frame would have worked. If you are looking for a gold frame that is high quality and not some cheap piece of garbage, I highly recommend purchasing this product. And the delivery was really fast. Even with Amazon prime, there seems to be a delay in many products being delivered. That was not the case here. It came faster than I expected."
"Awesome frame, thick and well constructed. Can be hung vertical or horizontal and placed on table."
"Got this on sale I think but the quality is very high for a good price, it looks really elegant and well built. It elevated the piece that I put into the frame by a lot and is a rich gold colour. Great find"
Great frame . Just what I needed
This is a royal product. One of a kind frame with gold borders. Easy to open install the pic and close it back.

"Like these for scent and the kit comes with small droppers to apply as many drops as you wish. The small bottles do not come as eye dropper. They have a small stopper in the bottle to remove when needing oil, but it ensures no leakage. Like the scents and the variety. Inside the container nicely done shows different drops for different reasons."
"These are the best and most potent oils besides Doterra! I wish they came in bigger sizes for the set because I run through them within a month, but I truly love mixing to find different scent moods every day. Take care!"
"This MayJam 20 piece essentials oil set is very good for the price. It includes all the popular scents and more. It comes in a box that's easy to open from the side. The glass bottles are small in size but a little goes a long way. Each scent has a stopper inside and then the cap. I reordered the scents in alphabetical order to find the ones I'm looking for easier. So far, I've used a few of the combinations listed on the inside cover (Refresh the Air, Refresh Spirit, Focus, and Sunday Vibes) in an electric oil diffuser that I also purchased from Amazon. Sometimes I adjust the drops down a bit so the scent isn't too strong or overpowering.I try to keep the set stored upright because I've noticed some minor leakage from a few of the bottles when it's left laying flat even when it's capped tightly.Overall, I would recommend."
I received the product very quickly and was package extremely well.  No leakage from any bottle. It's a very large selection. The scents are so delicate and transfer into my DIY lip and body products nicely.  The scents are perfect and original of each choice.  I love these and will be ordering again when needed.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I like this product because you get such a big variety of oil options and I love the different recipes. It‚Äôs fun because with the droppers it feels like it‚Äôs making a potion.I only did 3 stars because they are super hard to open. I‚Äôve broken one jar already trying to open it. The lids get covered in oil because of how they lay down. The dropper can make it almost worse and harder to use.There‚Äôs multiple I literally can‚Äôt even open anymore. For the price it‚Äôs fine but probably wouldn‚Äôt buy again."
You have a great selection to choose from and it works well in any diffuser
"Yes absolutely luv it best thing ever, üòç they smell so good I've only tried a few but already want to get a bigger one of them. Luv the packaging very neat and orderly"
"I have purchased several different oils from this company and I have to give a shout out to them. First of all, the oil comes safely packed into a nice box that is sealed with an outer wrapping. When you open the box, the glass dropper is secured in a foam package to prevent breakage and the bottle itself is also secured in tight-fitting cardboard. All products I ordered smell amazing and you get a large volume of oil (almost 4 oz) for the same price as many other products that only give you 0.5oz of oil! I love the dropper instead of the small bottles of oil that in many cases I have tried to add a specific amount of drops and those little plastic stoppers don't always allow the oil to come out one drop at a time. This dropper allows you to use exactly the amount you want, whether that is 3 drops or 1 ml at a time. Love the product and plan to buy more!"
"The Japanese Magnolia is an absolutely amazing scent, but it's normally 8.99, not 9.99Yalls black friday and cyber deal for 8.49 is a little saving but not a whole dollar fifty... lol.I'm still going to buy this again because I love the smell tho. Just not today! :)"
This vanilla smells wonderful.  I have started using it on several things I do like soap and creams.  I highly recommend it.  A wonderful amount for the money. Smells amazing.
The oil smells nice but when I put in a cold air diffuser it had a mild throw.After a few hours smell died outGood price but again throw needs to last longer
"I got the grape scent. I’ve been particularly obsessed with Grape juice/wine scents for a while now and was hopeful even after seeing reviews that said it smelled more like candy than actual grapes. But they were definitely telling the truth; it honestly smells like a cotton candy brand that had a limited edition grape flavor. It smells okay but definitely isn’t that soothing natural grape scent. I’ve been using it as a body oil. At first it has a chemical hint to it after putting it on, but I expected that since it’s a concentrate primarily used for air fresheners. I’m glad to say that the first thing to fade is said chemical scent, and that after that it gets a lot closer to a grape scent. I’d say in order, these are the scents I noticed: 1. Artificial grape with chemical undertones. 2. lazily made special grape edition of some candy that was not properly perfected. 3. grape jolly rancher. 4. I’m a particularly sweaty person and after a bit of a day id say the musk scent combines decently, where it luckily doesn’t smell like someone tried to hide a sweaty armpit by covering it in roses. All in all, i think im gonna look for a different kind just because it wasn’t what i was looking for, but if you just want the general concept of grape it will work well."
"Scent is good for lotions and soap. It has gardenia undertones with a hint of powder. Good for diys like  soap, lotions etc. if you’re looking for a lavender like scent that isn’t camphourous or pine like this will do."
I use it in place of dryer sheets smell lasts a long time and isn’t irritating to my skin like fabric softener and dryer sheets
Kinda smells like mango and peach together.  Smells so good.
Exactly what it says it is and smells divine. I used it in soap making
Really nice scent with wax melts works great
Really like this oil amazing scent
I bought this lavender essential oil because I haven’t ever bought the lavender. Great aroma from the oil lavender just cascading through the air extremely great price for the size of a bottle that I got just a little couple drops on my hands bone couple in the tub for my wife she loves it. Recommend this to everyone extremely affordable perfect size.
"I have been bitten twice by a brown recluse spider.  The first time I didn’t have this basil oil and tried to use oregano oil instead.  It didn’t work and skin started to turn .. so I used lavender oil to stop any further deterioration.  It WORKED!  Lavender oil actually stops the damage.  Went to my doctor on the following Monday, and she told me “whatever you’re doing it worked.. it definitely was a bite”.The second time I was bitten I did have basil oil, used it and it worked great!! I didn’t even need to go to the doctor to get it checked out!I found out spraying the house with peppermint oil sin water will keep spiders out of your house/storage area."
"This rose essential oil is incredibly concentrated—just one drop fills the room with a beautiful fragrance that lasts for days. After diluting it with water, the mixture can still be used for cleaning, like mopping the floor or refreshing the toilet, leaving the whole house smelling amazing. I bought it during Black Friday, and the price was unbelievably affordable. Highly recommend for anyone who loves natural, long-lasting scents!"
"Smells great and is easy to use with the dropper. Bought it to deter bugs, it doesnt seem to do that very well though. Every time I use the bottle, oil manages to get on the outside of it and can make a little bit of a mess. But other than that, I love the product"
"If your not sure which company to purchase high quality, organic Argan Oil from.. Read On! Honestly, there's many companies that offer high quality Moroccan Argan Oil, the first two that come to mind are Leven Rose and Kate Blanc. My girlfriend and I use Argan Oil from the aforementioned companies (we use many of the same body/skin/hair oils from various companies as each have different properties and factors involved) I ordered Majestic Purer Moroccan Oil in early August and the bottle arrived without the glass dropper. No problem.. This company, like others, though actually more so, stands by it's product and the customer support is nothing short of outstanding! I contacted Majestic Pure via e-mail here in the Amazon site and explained the problem. A new bottle was immediately sent out. Meanwhile, my girlfriend and I began applying the oil very carefully by pouring it slowly out of the bottle over the bathroom sink. I had never used Argan Oil before trying this company's product. I immediately noticed it's very thick and ""rich"" and absorbs very quickly. Not much of a scent, just the basic light odor that's accompanies all Argan Oil. A few days after trying this oil, being an Amazon Prime member, the replacement bottle arrived with the glass dropper securely packaged with the bottle of oil. Meanwhile, I also ordered Argan Oil from Kate Blanc and Teddie Organics. Leven Rose's Argan Oil just arrived and it hasn't been opened yet. As noted above, this oil is thick and rich and, in my opinion is the very best Argan Oil on the market today! It's 100% pure Moroccan Argan Oil.. Organic, cold pressed, unrefined and totally natural oil. Again, we rotate a few of the same oils in our nightly application from various companies (Jojoba, Argan and Coconut being a few we double up on) This Argan Oil is of superb quality and in my opinion it doesn't get any better than this, being so pure and natural.. The oil itself is basically clear, with a slight yellowish tint you'll see in the dropper when you apply it. To conserve this ""liquid gold"" as it's been called, we rotate it with Kate Blanc, Teddie Organics and we'll be adding Leven Rose's Argan Oil to our inventory of this particular oil within a few days. The oils from these companies are extreme high quality in themselves, yet we find Majestic Pure's Argan Oil to be the very finest in quality, definitely the best Argan Oil we've tried so far. We apply many oils to each other after our nightly warm bath and cool shower. What Fun! These oils include Jojoba, Argan, Coconut, Leven Rose Vitamin E Serum, VERB Ghost Oil and VERB Leave In Mist, Hairfluence Growth And Shine, Fur Oil, Toji Essentials Argan Hair Growth Oil Treatment (Amazing In Itself!) Darshana Natural Indian Hair Oil, Amaki Certified Organic Essential Oils (Five Organic Oils in One And More!)  Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil, and Leven Rose's Rosehip Night Serum. We just added Pumpkin Seed Oil & Carrot Seed Oil, they just arrived and we haven't added  them yet to our nightly routine. A few of these oils we use rather liberally, those being Jojoba, Argan and Coconut Oil as we apply these oils everywhere (I mean everywhere!) and the rest of the above oils we use very sparingly. The combination of these oils, for me, has thickened my body and pubic hair (already thick, I decided I wanted even thicker chest and pubic hair) and these oils in particular are doing the job, as I'm seeing results after just four to five weeks. Also, my skin is softer, more healthy and radiant.  We only use a few drops of Jojoba, Argan and Coconut Oil on the hair on our head, and not all at one time. (We use these oils very liberally on our body, and very sparingly on our scalp/hair)  Remember, of all the oils mentioned above, Jojoba, Argan and Coconut Oil can be used very liberally and in this light we've personally found Majestic Pure Moroccan Oil to be the ""king"" of Moroccan Argan Oil, the quality shines above all others, there is no doubt about that, so we've made it our primary Argan Oil! It's the finest money can buy! Remember, using these oils is wonderful yet to attain the best results in terms of what these organic, cold pressed all natural oils can deliver, a healthy lifestyle always adds more ""fuel to the fire!"" That healthy lifestyle, for us includes eating a lot of salad and fruit, meat only once or twice a week, in that we eat a lot of fish and poultry, we exercise daily  and of course we're very sexually active. All these factors in addition to the oils noted in this review gives our skin a radiance and glow we haven't seen in some time as well as thicker, fuller hair from our heads to our feet.. Literally, our hair is thicker everywhere.. So, when considering which Argan Oil to use, I honestly have to say feel free to use high quality oils from Kate Blanc, Leven Rose and Teddie Organics (I rate these oils as excellent) Yet, when you want to supplement your Argan Oil usage with the very highest quality oil you can purchase,  the best on the market today, go with Majestic Pure Moroccan Argan Oil! You'll absolutely love it! We Do!!"
This tea tree oil is as described in the description. I love that it comes with a dropper. That makes it easier to use without making a mess. I have several different essential oils from this brand and I’m satisfied with all of them.
I buy this lemonade essential oil all the time. I use it in making my homemade cleaners. Love the price for the size of the bottle. I am a repeat buyer.
"I use this essential oil for aromatherapeutic cognitive  association. The olfactory sense is one of the most closely tied to cognition, memory, and emotion. It is more closely tied to our oldest evolutionary brains as any of our senses. The entire Majestic Pure brand is a quality provide or essential oils for aromatherapy or topical application.Place these oils in a diffuser or atomizer and associate their various scents with your cognitive intentions—conscious and unconscious alike. They unmistakably capture the scents and profiles of each of their natural offerings. This is exceptional value without any compromise in quality."
"Perfect for mixing with other oils or by itself.  Good value , would definitely buy again"
"It is quite strong, but is a nice smell. I live in an apartment at the end of a long hall.  While walking up to the elevator I could smell it all the way up the hall.  I hope the others like it too. lol  I put some in the bottom of a small glass with a thick bottom on a cup warmer."
"I've been using this lavender essential oil brand for a few years now, and it has been great so far. The quality is consistent, and the fragrance is calming and pleasant."""
