It does what it advertises. I‚Äôm very happy with the product.!üòÅ
Makes the echo easier to use and looks good.
The stand is a no brainer as it allows the screen to be easily seen especially in the dark.
"Upgraded from a regular echo to this in kitchen. Love it, especially having visual reminders of any timers set, being able to watch movies etc. only downside is no Netflix."
Very Happy with this product. Will recommend. Thank You
This is the best speaker I purchased. It is way louder than expected. Well worth the money. You will not be disappointed. Easy to use. Small and portable. Clear and functions perfectly.
"I was given this speaker as a gift and immediately wanted to share this awesome little giant with others. The ease of use and portability is wonderful. Its capability to fill a room with pure, clean, robust sound is impressive. I have Bose speakers in my auto and home to play CDs but had no way to get that wonderful sound for listening to a play list from my phone. I was surprised that something so small and inexpensive could play with such pure sound. Easily rechargeable and long duration of power. It is light weight and doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space. Definitely recommend this product for young and old to enjoy !"
"I bought this blue tooth speaker for my show car that doesn't have a stereo. I own 2 Bose portable speakers and got this because of the good price. Wow! It does not disappoint! Music sounds great, easy to pair with my iPhone and has a fun color display. OK, the Bose speakers are little squares, smaller and a different shape than this speaker, but not a deal breaker. Also, a friend uses hers as a speaker for phone calls. I haven't tried that because I'm more interested in using it for music. It's a nice speaker."
"I recently purchased a pair of Bluetooth speakers to enhance my home viewing experience, particularly for connecting to my TV and creating a more theater-like atmosphere. While I encountered some challenges with connectivity to my Onn TV, the overall performance and quality of these speakers have left me quite satisfied. Here‚Äôs a detailed review based on my experience.Setup and ConnectivityThe initial setup of the Bluetooth speakers was straightforward and user-friendly. Connecting them to my other TV was a breeze; I simply powered on the speakers, activated Bluetooth on the TV, and they paired instantly. However, I did face issues connecting them to my Onn TV. I suspect this is due to compatibility limitations with the TV itself rather than a fault with the speakers. For anyone considering these speakers, it‚Äôs worth checking your device‚Äôs compatibility to avoid similar issues.Sound QualityOnce connected, the sound quality of these Bluetooth speakers truly impressed me. They deliver rich, clear audio that significantly enhances the viewing experience. The bass is robust without being overwhelming, providing a well-rounded sound profile that makes movies and music come alive. Whether I was watching action-packed films or listening to music, the audio clarity and depth exceeded my expectations for speakers in this price range.Design and Build QualityThe design of the speakers is sleek and modern, fitting well into any home decor. They are compact enough to not take up too much space but still powerful enough to fill a room with sound. The build quality feels solid, which gives me confidence in their durability over time.Price PointOne of the most appealing aspects of these Bluetooth speakers is their affordability. At under $10, they offer exceptional value for money compared to many other options on the market. There are certainly more expensive speakers available that boast additional features or brand prestige, but for someone looking for quality sound without breaking the bank, these speakers are an excellent choice.ConclusionIn conclusion, while I did encounter some connectivity issues with one of my TVs, the overall performance of these Bluetooth speakers has been highly satisfactory. They provide excellent sound quality, are easy to set up, and come at an unbeatable price point. With so many Bluetooth speaker options available today, finding one that balances quality and affordability can be challenging, but these speakers do just that. I would recommend them to anyone looking to enhance their audio experience at home without spending a fortune. Overall, I am quite happy with my purchase!"
"This is a terrific speaker.  It connects easily, and it sounds great.  I keep it in my shower so I can listen to music or the news.  I have quite a few small bluetooth speakers, and this one is my favorite.That being said, a few weeks after I purchased it, suddenly the speaker wouldn't power off.  It just stayed on.  When I disconnected my phone from it, it would stay in pairing mode with its blue light flashing.  This honestly didn't really bother me -- I just paired my phone to it the next day and it worked fine.  The problem came when the battery was dying.  It started beeping incessantly to alert that it needed charging, so then I had to run to plug it in to stop the beeping.  This got old REALLY fast.  I contacted the seller, and another speaker was promptly sent to me.Terrific speaker, terrific price, terrific customer service.  You can't go wrong with this speaker."
"This powerful little speaker packs a big punch! Very well made of very sturdy material. Has pretty good bass, nice mid tones, clear high tones...sounds great with jazz, classical, pop, soca, hip-hop, tribal house. Easy Bluetooth connection, light weight and extremely portable, lights up cycling different colors when playing and a long lasting battery charge."
"I have the unfortunate task of needing to clear out my parents' estate. There are a few large shop buildings on the property and they're all full of stuff that needs to be sorted through, trash tossed, and everything else readied for auction. This means long hours over several months, and I really need music to distract me while I work. I was able to get by just on my phone speaker, but when the weather turned hot, I had to employ some fans and the ambient sound was drowning out my phone. So off to Amazon I went in search of a speaker that could boost my music. I opted for this speaker by, BolaButty, and I'm really glad I did.The sound is incredible! Clarity is great, volume level caries over the droning of large fans, and I have had no issues at all with connectivity. The lights really aren't my thing, but they're neat and work well. Battery life is enough to get me through at least a twelve hour day, which is helpful. I also noticed that the speaker shuts down after several minutes of not being used, so if you forget to turn it off, it's no big deal.I can easily recommend this BolaButty speaker if you need to boost the volume of your music for whatever situation you may need."
"The Amazon Echo Show 8 strikes the perfect balance between functionality and performance. The 8-inch display is large enough for watching shows, following recipes, or making video calls, yet compact enough to fit on a kitchen counter or nightstand. The spatial audio is a standout feature, delivering rich and immersive sound that fills the room, making it ideal for music or video playback.As a smart home hub, it‚Äôs incredibly convenient. I‚Äôve synced it with various smart devices, and Alexa makes controlling them seamless. The camera‚Äôs auto-framing feature during video calls is a thoughtful addition, keeping me centered without needing adjustments. The built-in privacy controls, like the camera shutter and microphone mute button, offer peace of mind.If there‚Äôs a downside, it‚Äôs the slightly higher price compared to smaller models like the Echo Show 5. Additionally, while the sound is impressive, audiophiles might find it falls short of dedicated speakers.Overall, this device is an excellent choice for anyone wanting a versatile smart display that handles entertainment, productivity, and home automation with ease. It‚Äôs become an essential part of my daily routine!"
"The Amazon Echo Show 8 (newest model) has completely transformed how I manage my home and stay entertained. The spatial audio is impressive‚Äîclear and immersive whether I‚Äôm listening to music, podcasts, or using it for video calls. The screen size is just right for reading recipes, watching shows, or checking the weather without taking up too much counter space.The built-in smart home hub is a game-changer. I can now control my lights, thermostat, and cameras with ease, all from one device. Alexa is responsive and intuitive, making it easy to set reminders, check my schedule, or ask random questions while multitasking.The Glacier White finish blends beautifully with my kitchen decor, and the setup was straightforward. If you‚Äôre looking to upgrade your smart home or just want a reliable assistant, this is the perfect choice. Highly recommend it!"
"These are pretty cool. We use them for my kids room, our bathroom and my parents use in their kitchen. They work well in all locations. The moisture in the bathroom has not created any issues and I get it steamy a lot. The volume and sound quality are great for the price and there is no more delay than any other electronic. I am able to get it to connect to our receiver to stream to the speakers in the bathroom for improved sound. The video is what I was looking for and it‚Äôs been knocked off the counter a few times and still works great. For the cost this is a great product that I will most likely buy more of. The features are great and being able to see your answers you would normally ask Alexa on the screen is a game changer on occasions. I highly recommend buying if you are looking for an upgrade to the dots."

Riddle: What do you call an ""Echo Show 8"" when its display isn't working? -You call it simply an ""expensive Echo 8""!I've had the display on my new Show 8 (gen. 3) stop working twice in the 3 weeks I've owned and used it. Since this is not my first Echo Show (I've owned 5 of them over the last 4 years, including the 3 I still have now), and I know this display problem is not normal. A reboot (unplugging then replugging in the electrical power) restored the display the first time. This second occurrence of the problem left me concerned: how often can I expect this issue to resurface, and does it just indicate a hardware defect in my unit? So I made the accompanying video so that you could see what I'm referring to.It turns out that telling Alexa to ""Turn Off display"" while it's having this malfunction (while the display is black and the Display is non-responsive but while the device still responds audibly) And then saying ""Alexa"" (the wake word) restored the display and its responsiveness (to touch and verbal commands).But I don't think that's a permanent fix.Amazon customer support did advise toggling off the Auto Sleep setting in the device. This might be an acknowledgement of a software bug in that feature, but if it is, it's not afflicting my other Show (a current generation Show 10) that's using Auto Sleep.Except for the above, I do like my third generation Show 8 for the quality of its sound, responsiveness, overall utility (alarms, podcast-listening, news briefs, clock, timers, display of weather conditions, calendar events, home automation of smart lights and smart plugs for fans/+, hours and phone numbers of local retailers, etc.), and the display - when it's functioning properly!My Show 8 (gen. 3) did have one other problem during my first 3 weeks of using it: Increasingly, I needed to repeat the wake word (""Alexa"") to get the Show 8's attention. So I positioned my other Show 8 (gen. 1) near it on the same table and asked them both the same question - first the new ""gen. 3"" Show 8, then the ""gen 1"" Show 8 (which uses ""Echo"" as it's wake word). Then I listened to the Voice Activity in the Alexa app on my phone. There was considerable Distortion in the new ""gen. 3"" Show 8's recording, while the recording of the old (gen. 1) was remarkably clear. The short story is that Amazon customer support recommended the obligatory reboot, and that ""fixed"" it - for now, at least. (There was a theory that there may have been an external cause, but my testing has been unable to find evidence of that.)"
"I already had the Echo Show 5, but I LOVE the bigger screen size of the Show 8! Having the ability to turn it into a scrolling picture frame is also a really nice feature! It‚Äôs easy to read my notifications, easy to see things like cameras when I need to check them - on the larger screen! It‚Äôs easy to use with voice controls, physical buttons & the Alexa App. The Speakers are definitely AWESOME- this little guy packs a HUGE punch when playing music or watching a video! Definitely worth the price! It‚Äôs quick & easy to set up & links to your Amazon account & Alexa App! You won‚Äôt regret this purchase"
"I was able to connect all smart devices to it, even other brands."

Tiene buen sonido me encant√≥!!üòç"
Picked up the Echo Show 8 3rd generation in the US in March because it took pretty much a year to be released in Canada. Hugely better than the second generation. Significantly better sound quality for music. Responds much quicker to requests. Works great for viewing the camera for the Blink video doorbell. Love the rotating photo option. My favourite Echo ever.
"To give a bit of background I am an audiophile (a lover of music) and take my music quite seriously. I run some serious hardware from meze elite epoque headphones to legacy signature speakers. I say all this to give a bit of credit to my background on sound and knowing where a good set of transducers can take you.I recently changed my bedroom audio setup to move my floor standing speakers (old wharfedale diamond 9.5's) to acomidate my tv. This had the drawback of removing them from my echo and I needed a solution to provide the room with ""good enough"" audio that the little echo just could not muster. So I started my search for a new all in one voice assistant but did not want a second set of tower speakers in the room so I looked at the usual suspects. The echo studio, sonos, etc but none of them had what I was looking for when it came to sound quality. Enter the jbl 500 it was not on my radar at all but I stumbled across it in my searching. It had mixed reviews with an emphasis on the size of the speaker. Now for me coming from a set of tower speakers size was not the limiting factor. So I ordered one and had it at my door in no time at all. This guy was well packed and had a good presentation my only complaint is that the bass driver is exposed and you have to be cognizant not to put a finger through it as you lift it out of the box. This speaker has a good amount of weight for its size and feels well built. Physical setup is a breeze with one power cable and you are done. After that you need the app which is not the best but definitely not the worst I have used. In the app you will connect it to your wifi and then setup your voice assistants. This guy supports both google and alexa with the former being very easy to setup and the latter being a oddity. The google setup punched right in like any other google home device and setup was a breeze. The alexa app on the other hand just opened to a spinning circle with no errors. After contacting tech support I tried everything under the sun to get it to take and somewhere along the line fixed it. I am not sure if it was a wifi bug or just needed to run in for some time but after I tried the next day everything popped right in no problem.Now on to the sound... good golly this was not what I was expecting! This guy goes to show what modern tech has brought to the table vs my older diamond speakers. I started it on some tash music because I was not expecting much from this guy but what came belting out from this box was clean powerful sound. My first stop was ""the used - in love and death"" and there it was a musical tonality that I would described as playful or V shaped. The bass was plentiful but not overwhelming, solidly in the fun category but not drifting into bloated or slow territory. In short it sounded good, darn good... better than it had rights to sound given its size. So intrigued I switched from background music to my analytical music section to see if this was some kind of fluke. I popped on one of my favorites the live copy of ""Fink - troubles what you are in"" and gave this speaker my full attention. This speaker did not shirk from my critical ear as the acoustic guitar was crisp and you could distinctly pick out the difference between the sounds of his palm on the wood vs the cajon. I was gobsmacked, baffled, dare I say impressed. I tossed the kitchen sink of all the greats (steely dan, daftpunk, pinkfloyd, etc) at this box and it continued to impress. I was left wondering if I toss the diamonds in favor of picking up another one of these it is THAT GOOD. The fact that a single six inch driver could come even close to the range that four drivers of the same size is witchcraft.I love the sound profile that this uses with the heavy V shape. To me this is one of my favorites as it sets the toes a tapping and head a bobbing more than that holy grale flat profile. I would compare this to the fiio FH9 as something that I turn on and go ""that sounds right"" no tweaking or changes it just sounds like my ideal of what I want from music.If you made it this far into the review I commend you! If you just scrolled to the end for the TLDR buy it you wont be dissapointed."
"Not cheap, but a great sounding speaker for the size. Of course, you're not going to get a stereo image out of a single speaker, but it sounds good for what it is. We have it on the counter in our kitchen, and I use it while cooking and eating. More than powerful enough to be heard over the super loud downdraft exhaust fan on our stove when cooking. I'm a recording/mixing/mastering engineer, so I'm picky about sound. Sure, this is not as good sounding as my studio monitors, but it serves its purpose and is much less expensive and smaller than my studio monitors.I'm using primarily Amazon Music which it has built-in support for (among several other services), and there are no issues with that for the most part. Once in a while I have to login again to my Amazon account. Or, on rare occasions, this speaker gets disconnected from the network, but is easily fixed by simply unplugging and plugging in again. It does have a wired ethernet connection if you want a more reliable network connection, but I didn't have an ethernet port nearby and the wifi signal where the speaker is located is not great.The main reason I got this type of speaker is that it streams directly from the services via WiFi, as opposed to a cheaper Bluetooth only speaker that would use the lower quality Bluetooth audio format. So, with Amazon Music HD, you can get at least CD quality, lossless audio, which is important to me. You can set it up for Alexa to use voice commands to start streaming from Amazon music, or you can use the Amazon Music App on your phone to connect to the speaker and stream in HD (as opposed to Bluetooth), as the speaker will still do the streaming itself and the phone is just the interface. The JBL One app is nice for setting this up and for control volume and such, but it misses out on some features of the Amazon music app, such as the ability to shuffle a playlist."
"Purchased 2 on sale and use as a secondary system in the house in stereo mode. They are excellent! Great bass, mids and highs!After numerous models I have finally settled on this. The ease of use and superb sound quality as well as the retro look made the decision easy. Not cheap but well worth it if you appreciate sound quality above all. I did not want the battery model....I have others for portable use and the size is perfect.Having the wifi option was a dealer maker for me! Playback from Tidal in FLAC is much better than Bluetooth!If you are willing to spend the money, 2 in stereo mode is incredible.....don't hesitate."
These speakers pack a punch. I only need to keep the volume at 20% and the sound fills the room. Excellent frequency range. I like how it has knobs to adjust treble & bass. I did have a bit of interruption when using the AirPlay mode from an M1 Macbook but that might be from my WiFi connection. Playing music via Bluetooth was fine. Using the AUX input was much more reliable.
"JbL has a reputation for making good subs, at least they made the best when I was in school 99-2000.  The speaker is heavy and seems well made, should be for the price.. but all in all I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m quite happy with the performance"
"These speakers produce great, deep sounds that fill the room. I recommend this model for rooms up to about 200 sqft. Rooms larger than that will require the next model in the Sonos product line.The setup was straightforward, and linking Apple Music was simple. I have three speakers (in the kitchen, living room, and dining room) and love how straightforward it is to select individual speakers and adjust the volume of each room through the Sonos app.The design is very minimalistic, making it perfect for concealing the speaker in your room. People often wonder where the music is coming from because it fills the room, but it's hard to pinpoint where the speaker is.Great product! It has high-quality sound, is easy to set up and use, and has a solid build."
"I already have 2 Era 100's and a Sub mini in my Family room. They sound fantastic.  Some times I like to sit in my Living room and read, or meditate. But I would turn the volume up in the family room so I could hear those speakers. So I decided to get a third  Era 100 for my living room. I put it on a small decorative shelf.  I must say it is everything I imagined it would be. When setting it up I didn't know I could turn off selected speakers. This was a unexpected plus for me. So if I am in my living room I could just have the one Era 100 speaker play and vice versa. Or I could have all three and the sub mini playing at the same time. After having the 2 Era 100's and Sub mini for a couple of months now, I had forgotten how good just 1 Era 100 speaker sound. I did notice the two Era 100's paired with the sub sound more clear and crisp than the single Era 100's. That's because the Sub mini is using the low that the Era 100's would had normally played. Great concept in sound and speakers.  I just turned the treble up a little bit more in the single Era 100 to get more highs. Sounds good. It's too bad Sonos doesn't allow for multiple Sub minis connected in the same group, it would be phenomenal. I had read somewhere that it wasn't cost effective for the consumer to buy 2 Sub minis when 1 Gen 3 Sub woofer has more output than two Sub minis. I say who cares Sonos? If a consumer wants to spend their money on a second Sub mini and put in in another room in the same speaker group it's their prerogative. If that's true then their business model doesn't make since to me. Set up was a breeze too. Because I didn't use a tutorial to set this up, it took me a few minutes to figure out how to select the speaker, because at first the single Era 100 didn't play although it was connected.  But the setup was a breeze. Very easy. I may get another Era 100 (this time used) and put it in my kitchen and I'll have sound throughout all of downstairs. I've been fortunate to not have problems with the app, unlike many others. I am very impressed and satisfied."
"I spent 45 minutes on hold for TWO DIFFERENT customer service calls. Each call ended up being TWO hours long. The set up is not easy. At first it was and I thought I was good to go, but with the App updates several of my speakers could not get connected/registered to my Sonos System. I am working with Sonos Era, Sonos Play, and Sonos Roam speakers. I had to start restart my router and phone multiple times and factory rest all the speakers. Some wouldn't even Factory Reset. One Customer Service Lady said that my Router was the issue and I needed to call Spectrum and have them manually reset it fromWiFE6 default bandwidth 802.11 AXN because my bandwith is not supported by Sonos.  WHAT???!!! That's a serious design issue. So I called Spectrum and of course their routers are unable to do the thing that Sonos needs. So they reccomended I buy a Dual Band Router. Now COME ON! Do I really want to do that? So I called Sonos Customer Service again, waited 45 minutes on hold. Then we were able to get all my speakers correctly set up to the system and everything was playing correctly. For one hour. Then the music stopped out of nowhere. The phone was near the router and I didn't touch anything. Now it's stuck in Glitch mode. I was able to get it to play music but the App isn't displaying that the speakers are playing anything and its giving me an Error Message saying Unable to Work. Try again. Well for a brand whose whole gimmick is ease of set up and use, this is a total Fail. Am most likely going to return them all which is unfortunate because the sound is great."
"I love Sonos speakers. I have the Sonos surround sound in my living room, but I didn't have it in my bathroom where I used to listen to the radio while getting ready in the morning. The radio didn't have the talk show that I liked so I stopped the radio part. I decided to give myself an early Christmas gift and purchase a Sonos speaker for my bathroom and listen to whatever music I wanted to by subscribing to Amazon Music. I also purchased an Echo Dot (Alexa) and just tell her what I want to listen to and I love it. The sound is absolutely wonderful. I'm a very happy 86 year old woman."
"I listen to music for a large part of the day at home.  I have had a jam box for 8-9 yrs and thought it was the best until I got the Sonos!! The quality, the bass is just a step above the jam box!  What I don‚Äôt like about it‚Ä¶ it is not battery operated for portability and it doesn‚Äôt stay connected to my iPhone.  So every time I use it I have to connect to my phone and who knows, that could be something I‚Äôm doing wrong. Anyway, just an extra step for me to use it which it‚Äôs so worth it in my opinion.  I highly recommend this speaker if you are a music lover!"
I run two of these with a Sonos sub-woofer electronically coupled to one of them.  I have them configured in two different connected rooms with Spotify over my phone through our WIFI network so they play simultaneously and fill the rooms with really nice sound - surprisingly good actually for such small units.I do recommend adding a  Sonos sub-woofer (I used a sub-mini) to fill out the tones and the rooms.  It isn't cheap but is well work the money.FYI - the Sonos app isn't particularly intuitive or helpful in my view but you can get around it once installed and setup on your network by working directly through Spotify by selecting the Sonos speakers as your output device.
"Loud quality sound in a small package. Simple set up with the Sonos app and fast delivery. Great value, especially at sale price"
"This USB hub is a fantastic investment! It's not only sleek and stylish with its aluminum housing, but it also performs exceptionally well. I was initially concerned about overheating issues, but this hub's design effectively dissipates heat, ensuring reliable performance.The high-speed USB ports are incredibly fast, allowing for rapid data transfers between devices. Whether you're connecting multiple peripherals or transferring large files, this hub handles it all with ease. The HDMI port delivers crystal-clear video output, making it perfect for extending your workspace."
"This USB-C hub has been an excellent addition to my workstation. Since I connected it to my laptop, I've noticed a significant improvement in port versatility and data transfer speed. It comes with multiple ports, including HDMI, USB-A ports and a USB-C charging port, allowing me to connect all my devices without worrying about running out of space.The best part is how compact and lightweight it is. I can carry it everywhere in my backpack without it taking up much space, which is perfect for those of us who are always on the go."
"This is a nice, solid piece of equipment - aluminum, not plastic. It has made my laptop usable once again."
"All the ports work well, and it is easy to use. I have only been using it for a few days, so I don't know how long it can be useful. I hope Ugreen items are always used for a long time."
"Works very well. Plugs into my Windows 11 laptop ... gives me additional USB ports for my other peripheral devices. I don't personally make use of the ethernet port on it, as I'm always on WiFi, but it is nice to know it is available if needed. Recommended!"
Great product and faster delivery
Great functionality and does what is needed. It is truly plug and play and works great to hook up my tv to my laptop. Great purchase.
"I purchased this hub to replace my 1.5 years old cheap hub which was working fine. I decided to buy this one since it had 2 usb C ports, 2 usb A ports and an hdmi. My last hub only had 1x usb A  1x usb c and 1 hdmi. So I wanted to have extra ports. I recieved it a month ago and used it for 3 weeks to connect my screen, nvme ssd enclosure and my usbC headphones while working at the office. Out of the blue it stopped recognizing my enclosure and my headphones. I went ahead and tried it on different devices and different usb sticks and cables and it seems that the usb ports on the docking station seized to work. I have a couple of ugreen products and I'm disappointed that it stopped working in less than a month. Had to switch to my old Reliable hub."
"Was very excited to receive this USB-C hub as we wanted to mirror our tablets to the TV. Our previous efforts of mirroring wirelessly failed as there was too much latency/lag so the audio was out of sync.The hub was smaller than I expected, and was very solid. The metal shell was visually perfect and had an air of luxury... While the hub was small, the packaging was larger than required... this isn't a bad or good thing as the packaging seemed quite capable of protecting the item. There was an instruction manual of sorts in the box but besides looking at the diagram, I recycled everything immediately. Its a USB-C hub... it ain't rocket science.Of our 2 tablets that we use for media consumption, only the Samsung S7 FE worked. After some googling, I noted that Samsung downgraded the S9 FE to not output video through USB. Hopefully this tidbit can save some grief for others.Right as I connected the Samsung S7 FE to the hub, and the hub to the HDMI cable, the TV outputted a picture immediately. Because of the tablet's resolution, there were ever so slight black bars on both SIDES of the TV. This wasn't too much of a distraction, but food for thought for some of you.Scrolling through the desktop and apps yielded nothing out of the ordinary. I played Disney+ and Jellyfin (think Plex) on it and the picture was beautiful with no perceptible latency/lag. The only caveat was a bit of jitter - think not a perfectly smooth picture, but every few seconds not constant. I'm not sure if it is because of my 4 or 5 year old Sony TV, a handshake problem, the wrong HDMI port on the TV, an HDMI cable issue or something in between. Would it be enough to bother some people? Definitely yes. Does it bother me at all? No. For all I know, this could be a setup issue on my TV... I'll try changing some modes and other things later.I haven't tried attaching power or any storage devices, and quite frankly don't think that I ever will. We will be solely using this to watch Netflix on our TV as we borrow someone's Netflix account, so we can't play Netflix on the TV directly.From the various reviews that I have read, most people indicate this is a reputable brand. From my limited time using this specific item, I have to concur.Is this priced too high or too low? Well, if you can get this on a slight sale, then it is a solid product that does what it promises."
"I have an Asus Zenbook that's at least 7 years old (ancient by technology standards) and it has a very problematic USB hub. I love my laptop. It functions well except for the hub. I usually get OEM peripherals for my electronics. (I use PC and Android. I'm not a Mac/Apple user.)In the case of the USB hub for my Zenbook the Asus replacement hub is garbage with a 1 star review on Asus website with warnings not to buy because of how fast it stops working. The Asus hub I purchased 3 months ago stopped working after using it 3 or 4 times. That's unacceptable in my opinion. I have tried other brands including Belkin, Anker and 2 others that I do not remember. None of them would deliver power to my laptop despite claiming they would. So I decided to try this hub. I need an external hub for the multiple USB ports because the Asus has no ports on the Zenbook itself, and power delivery (in a perfect world when everything works properly) should also be able to go thru the hub to charge the laptop. On my laptop, there's only one USB-C port to connect either direct power supply or a hub. You can't have both connected at the same time unless the hub allows power transfer to laptop, which the other brand hubs that I tried wouldn't support that power transfer, much to my frustration. This hub is the first hub that I've tried that will actually power my laptop. (I also switched my power supply cable to a Thunderbolt, so the combination of the new cable with this hub works.) I use a wireless mouse with a dongle that needs to be plugged in. I have a digital voice recorder that plugs in directly via USB-A to transfer files to the laptop. I use SD cards in my camera and MP3 player that I need a hub to transfer that media onto the laptop. This hub will allow all of that. Every port works that I have tried on this Acer hub and this hub does the thing that the other hubs failed to do on my laptop. The power transfer was the big issue for me and this Acer hub solved the problem that several others including the OEM, Asus, failed to do. Because of how many months I have been dealing with the power supply problem, hubs not delivering what they promised and this being the only hub that did work, I rate this product at 5 stars. It's less expensive than the Asus hub that stops working immediately after purchasing. It has more ports than the Asus hub with the extra SD card reader that the Asus hub doesn't have. It's a heavier duty outer shell compared to the Asus. The cord is thicker and better protected compared to the Asus, so it reduces the chance for stressing or bending the cord in a way that could break the wires inside or break the connector away from the wires. It's just a better design overall, when compared to the Asus hub. I am extremely satisfied with this Acer hub and I would recommend it since it did the ""impossible"" task that no other brand could do for me. 5 stars, indeed."
This hub does it all. Two USB A in great locations and work well. Two USB C arewell placed and I especially love the one that is able to charge a laptop (100w I think) and still work as a normal USB as well. HDMI is in a great location and easy to use. Short cord powering the hub is the perfect length to connect to everything. Love this HUB!
I tried it on my laptop and it does great. Card reader works but only one at the time (either the microSD/TF or the Big SD like the microSD in the SD adapter) The only con is you only get up to 30hz on my laptop when you are in 4K resolution. Others like 1080p and 720p have 60hz on my TV.But the main reason that I made the right purchase is for the Retroid Pocket 4 Pro. It charges flawlessly and HDMI out really works and I can connect my keyboard/mouse unifying reciever and/or a controller via USB. It really works! So now my handheld android gaming console can also be a home console like the switch. Worth the buy. Highly recommend.
"Device seems to work well, it's a good size, seems to be sturdy and allows multiple different connections... however I purchased this because I needed the ability to charge my device while also using my AR glasses.... but the USB-C port does not allow for that, so I will need to return it."
Its a very practical gadget and easy to carry.

2nd EDIT: Not only did the company offer a refund, they also generously shipped me another unit, and it works just as it should! They gave fast responses when the first unit gave me issues, and addressed it as well as you possibly could. I would use them any time!EDIT: the company quickly reached out and offered a full refund as a result of a faulty product. For me, that goes a long way. I have plenty of ACER products and normally have no issues with them. could have just been a faulty single product.Very bummed. For the first 2 hours of use it worked great. When it‚Äôs just USB-C to HDMI connected it works fine, but the second I go to plug my Mac in, while using the HDMI to stream to my monitor, the screen begins flashing every second or two on both my Mac, and the monitor. The flashing screen is happening at the same time the Mac keeps making its ‚Äúchime‚Äù that the charger is connected, over and over again. Clearly something is going on that the charging is not staying active. whenever the charger is first connected it causes a quick(ish)black screen, which I could live with if it just happened right as I plugged the charger in‚Ä¶ but when the charger KEEPS thinkings it‚Äôs just getting plugged in over and over, and keeps flashing, it kind of makes the product useless. And I‚Äôve already thrown the box away so I guess I‚Äôm stuck with a product that doesn‚Äôt work. Super bummer."
"Convenient, with multiple ports to expand your computer use.  Works flawlessly."
The new computer has a usb c that needs this adapter for hdmi connection. This works perfectly.
"I was skeptical of this little unit but I figured for the price, why not.  I've been pleasantly surprised. It feels solidly built and very sleek.  It worked right away as it connected automatically (as per my Dex Setting) and it's working just fine.  I'm actually typing this review with the unit right now.It works with my wireless keyboard and I plugged in an wired mouse as well.  When plugged in, it also charges my phone... slowly, but it does charge.So far I have no comlaints.  I hope it lasts. 5 stars!"
"Well made usb hub. Plug it into your computer and have all the ports of a gaming laptop.  Good value for money and it's not let me down yet. Ive only used it for my thermal printer so far,so I can't comment on heat levels. I'm happy with it."
"This is a wonderful little hub that gets the job done affordably and with a smaller footprint than other big boxes that sit on your desk. However, I learned a few things about the shortcomings of my Dell Latitude 3540 that comes with a Factory Power supply 65 W adapter: It won't work with a hub that consumes its own power for your peripherals.The problem was that the 65W Dell charger that came with my laptop is not powerful enough to power the hub AND provide sufficient power to the laptop. When i used the Anker hub with the factory supplied adapter, the hub sucks off 15 W for mouse, keyboard, etc., leaving the laptop only 40W. The laptop power manager kept complaining that it was starving. I solved this problem by buying a more powerful charging adapter. (https://a.co/d/0be3Lwti) This is a problem with my Dell, not the Anker hub. (Btw, this Dell latitude uses a PD port, which didn't work with my $300 Thinkpad lightning 4 hub, which is why i bought this less expensive Anker.)Now that it's working, it's great! It's tiny, easy to plug in and works immediately, even as i switch from conference room back to my desk. No hiccups or blurps and my computer doesn't need a moment to recognize its new reality each time i plug/unplug.Anker customer support was fantastic. I love this brand and will continue to favor it for price and reliability."
"The **Anker 332 USB-C Hub (5-in-1)** has been a fantastic addition to my tech setup! It‚Äôs compact, easy to carry, and provides all the essential ports I need for work and entertainment. The **4K HDMI display** port works flawlessly, allowing me to connect my laptop to an external monitor or TV with crystal-clear resolution and no lag.The **two 5Gbps USB-A data ports** are super fast, making file transfers quick and efficient. I‚Äôve used them to connect my external hard drive and a USB mouse simultaneously, and both worked without any hiccups. The hub is well-built and feels durable, with solid connections that don‚Äôt feel loose or flimsy.This hub is a must-have for anyone looking to expand their laptop's connectivity options, especially if you need extra USB-A ports or HDMI output. It‚Äôs **plug-and-play**, no drivers required, and works seamlessly with both my MacBook and Windows laptop. Highly recommend this Anker hub for anyone in need of a reliable, compact solution for extra ports!"
"The Anker 5-in-1 hub is perfect to connect my phone to my monitor and keyboard, so that I can use the phone more easily when typing long text messages or other entries. It is well made, looks great, and works well. I do need to connect a USB-C power cable to the hub for using the monitor, but the side benefit is that it charges the phone while I‚Äôm using the hub.The only issue I had was that there was no User Manual included, and the QR code on the box did not take me to a location where I could download the manual. I sent an email to Anker and they responded the next day with the link to the manual. I was also impressed that the manufacturer contacted me the following day to ensure I had everything I needed. A nice follow through!I‚Äôm pleased with the product and look forward to using it with my phone."
"Handy and reliable, sticks by Anker's product quality and trust. Can be used efficiently with laptops supporting USB C ports. Works great with apple laptops like MacBook air and MacBook pro. No glitches in connection to HDMI ports. All the ports can be used simultaneously and there are no slowness or any issue observed. Good pricing too for this excellent product. Probably missing audio jack (3.5mm) other than that it is a great product that support simultaneous charging also."
"I was a bit nervous about buying this product, as it doesn't mention explicitly that it works with Samsung DEX, and USB OTG can be a bit wonky. However, I'm happy to report that it works fantastic with Samsung DEX (I paired it with a Galaxy S21 Base Model).I have a funny workstation set up where I have this attached to my phone, using passthrough charging, connected to a wireless keyboard and mouse, all attached to a portable HDMI monitor. Outside of the novelty of using my phone as a desktop, it has the added benefit of having way more battery life than my laptop, and being able to charge from a relatively slow USB connection.Overall, if you have a phone that can use USB OTG, I recommend getting this just to have a good way to connect your phone to your TV. Solid product all around."
"I am using the hub to connect a Dell XPS 13 to a 4K HDMI monitor (TV). I was having problems with the hub shutting off after a couple hours. Upon consulting with Anker Support, I discovered that the standard wall adapter for the Dell XPS 13--a 45W adapter--is not powerful enough to sustain powering the hub when connected to a 4K HDMI video monitor. From Support: ""The hub's USB-C PD port supports charging from 53W to 85W, and it's recommended to use a PD wall charger that is 12W to 15W stronger than your original one. Therefore, using a higher wattage power supply within the supported range (53W to 85W) should help keep the hub powered consistently.""It was not a problem for me to purchase a 100W wall charger from Dell to resolve the issue. Since then, the hub works fine. While I am very happy with the hub, I wish the marketing copy/product description here and on Anker's Web site would have spelled out the wall adapter requirements more explicitly. I could have saved my time and Anker Support's time troubleshooting.Otherwise, the hub is just what I need; since adding an adequate wall adapter, it works great."
"Amazing hub, transformed my MacBook into super computer. Light weight, small and solid hub."
"The Anker 332 USB-C Hub has been a revelation for my MacBook experience, providing a seamless and versatile way to connect all my peripherals and devices.This 5-in-1 hub is incredibly compact yet packed with features that have greatly enhanced my productivity and workflow.The 4K HDMI display output is stunning, allowing me to connect my laptop to a larger screen or projector with ease.The two 5Gbps USB-A data ports provide ample storage and charging capabilities, making it easy to transfer files or charge multiple devices at once. I've also appreciated the ability to connect my headphones or speakers via the hub's dedicated audio jack, freeing up my laptop's built-in port for other uses.Overall, this Anker interface has become an indispensable tool in my daily workflow, providing a reliable and convenient way to expand my MacBook's capabilities without sacrificing portability or ease of use."
Very useful for my MacBook pro
"needed an extra hub, everything in it works well"
"I have an Anker 4-Port USB 3.0 Data Hub to USB-C that holds my Keyboard, Mouse and Anker Ethernet adapter plugged into it. It was a hassle having to unplug this to charge my iPad Pro on a separate charging cord. . So this Anker Charging and Data Hub did the trick!  Just plug my 4 port into one of the data ports and plug my USB-C charging cord into the charging port. Voila! Works like a charm!Update: I got rid of my Anker 4 port data hub and just used usb to usb-c adapters for my usb keyboard, usb mouse and Anker usb ethernet adapter."
I'm happy with this product. It allows me to use more usb-c on a desktop that just has type-a connectors. And I can download much faster than before.
"I purchased this adapter for my iPad Pro so that I could easily import drone photos and put them on an external drive. I had issues with the unit I received, and unfortunately I didn't test or discover them until the return window had closed.Anker stands by this product. When I described the issue to them, they offered to send a replacement, or issue me a refund. They were certain my unit was malfunctioning. Because I already found an alternative adapter, I took the refund, but nevertheless, anker is a great company with great customer service. You can purchase this adapter knowing that rest assured, in it doesn't work for you, anker will ensure your satisfaction nevertheless."
I like that there is no extra power cord for when traveling.  I also like that it is flat and the ports are spaced out as that makes it easy to use security devices that can be a bit wider than just a cable.
"I tried another low cost hub to connect 3 ssd‚Äôs to my MacBook with no success. This hub connects 3 ssd‚Äôs with no problems. The secret is the pd port which is connected to a power supply. Even though labeled as pass through power to the Mac, this port apparently also supplies power to the ssd‚Äôs. Unplug the power, ssd‚Äôs disconnect. Plug in the power, ssd‚Äôs work consistently. Highly recommended."
"This Anker USB-C is good overall, but I had an issue where it doesn't work after waking from sleep in Windows 11. It's ""permanently"" connected to my desktop PC. My other card reader/hub does NOT have this issue, so it seems the Anker hub is to blame.The quick solution to fix this is to unplug and re-plug it in.The permanent fix is to adjust USB power settings in Windows. In Windows Search, type ""Control Panel"" and click on that result. In the Control Panel, click Hardware and Sound > Power Options > Change plan settings (for your current plan). Then click ""Change advanced power settings,"" ""USB Settings,"" and set the ""USB selective suspend setting"" to ""Disabled.""After making that change, it should work right away out of sleep."
"Ever felt like your laptop is playing hide and seek with all your devices? The Anker USB C Hub 341 has been my ultimate tech savior, transforming my MacBook Pro into a connectivity powerhouse! With seven ports, I can now connect everything from my 4K HDMI monitor to my trusty USB-A drives without juggling cables like a circus performer.The 100W Power Delivery is a game-changer, keeping my laptop charged even during marathon work sessions or intense gaming nights. The microSD and SD card readers are perfect for my photography hobby, allowing me to transfer photos at lightning speed. Plus, the sleek design fits seamlessly into my workspace, making it look as organized as a professional‚Äö√Ñ√¥s desk.However, I did notice that when all ports are in use, the hub can get a tad warm, but nothing that can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be managed with a little ventilation. Also, while the setup is straightforward, it took me a few tries to figure out the optimal port arrangement for my needs.Overall, the Anker USB C Hub 341 is a must-have for anyone looking to expand their laptop‚Äö√Ñ√¥s capabilities. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s versatile, reliable, and stylish, making my tech life so much easier. A solid 5-star rating for its performance and design, with a tiny star lost to its occasional warmth."
This is a great adapter to have in your computer bag.  Works well to plug your computer into almost anything.  Works perfect.
"I purchased this HUB to use with my SteamDeck, it has worked perfectly.  I use it for when I travel and love how compact it is.  I used it along with the SteamDeck's power supply, a very skinny 12 ft HDMI cable, and a 6 FT USB-C extension to the SteamDeck so I can use the SteamDeck as the controller. I like using the SteamDeck as a controller because I use Steam controls (back triggers and trackpads shortcuts).  Sometimes I have needed a power extension cord, but that has more to do with the layout of the rooms I have used it.  It also works with my old Samsung Note 8 to get DEX on any screen.  I would like to let you know if it works with a computer, but I need to upgrade to one with USB-C ports... planning to get one soon.For what I'm using this HUB, it has way more ports than I need, but it's never bad to have extra ports if the price is acceptable. Also, the price for this was way less than the official SteamDeck dock and a good portion of the alternatives. Plus, since I prefer to use the SteamDeck as a controller, the other docks don't really work for me."
