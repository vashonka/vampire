"My granddaughter is 22 months old and one of her favorite books is about a little bunny who goes to see the doctor.  She studies each page and is very interested in all the things the doctor does, checking heartbeat, ears, throat.  She is also a big Barbie fan so this set was the perfect gift.  It was an early Christmas gift and she LOVES it.  Barbie's hands are styled so that she can hold her stethoscope to check the babies heartbeat.  The babies are very cute, the diapers are not great, one has been lost already, but it doesn't matter to her.  She carries the babies around and always asks for ""Doctor"".  The little cart is cute and she likes to play with it, too.  The set comes with two little bottles for the babies and Barbie is able to hold them.  The little hand sanitizer bottle is cute - my granddaughter pretends that she's squirting the sanitizer on her hands.  Doctor Barbie has examined all of her other Barbies, stuffed animals, and other dolls.  Overall a wonderful little set that sparks the imagination."
Exactly what my daughter wanted.
Kiddo loves it! Good quality and can’t beat the price for hours of play
"This was a birthday gift for a 3 year old little girl who is in love with Barbie.  She loved the Barbie, that she could be the doctor/nurse for two babies.  Perfect gift for her!!!"
"I recently purchased the ""Barbie Baby Doctor Playset"" for my daughter and overall, we were quite happy with it. The set comes with a Barbie doll dressed in scrubs, as well as two baby dolls, medical accessories, and a baby scale. The pieces are all made of durable plastic and seem to be of good quality.One of the things I really liked about this set was the attention to detail. The medical accessories, such as the stethoscope and thermometer, looked just like the real thing, and my daughter loved pretending to use them on her patients. The baby dolls were also very cute and my daughter enjoyed taking care of them.The only reason I am giving this set 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish there were more accessories included. For example, it would have been nice to have a small bed or crib for the babies to sleep in. Additionally, while the set is great for imaginative play, it may not hold the attention of older children for very long.Overall, I would recommend the ""Barbie Baby Doctor Playset"" for any child who loves playing doctor or taking care of babies. It's a great addition to any toy collection and is sure to provide hours of imaginative play."
Bought for our 5 year old granddaughter.  This barbie is adorable.
Perfect for any little girl that loves to play nurse doctor or mommy
Everything you need to pretend to take care of small babies. Very cute. Great set to add to a doll house.
We are very into barbies and role play and this set didn’t disappoint. You get a lot of items for the price and the two baby barbies are just adorable. Also comes with lots of accessories for endless fun! Perfect set for a gift!
Great set! Got it for my sons bday and he was very happy with all the different items.
This 76-piece set is a fantastic value! The variety of pencils and sketchbook offer endless creative possibilities. Perfect for artists of all levels.
"The Prima 76 piece art set is a fantastic set for any artist, beginner or experienced. The set includes a wide range of high-quality art supplies, including colored pencils, watercolor paints, oil pastels, and more. The colors are vibrant and blend well, allowing for endless creative possibilities. The set also comes in a durable and compact case, making it easy to take on the go. Overall, I highly recommend the Prima 76 piece art set for anyone looking to expand their artistic horizons."
"Bought this as a gift for a family member, and I love how it has everything you need to get started with sketching and drawing. Everything seems high quality and super excited to see the resulting masterpieces it makes! Super beginner friendly and very affordable."
Bought this for my 13 y/o. He loves it and uses it often. Have a good variety and quality pencils for a good price.
The zipper case as well as the art supplies are decent quality. The different meduims make it easy to do many projects. Bonus....when finished it stores organized and zipped up for next time.  it's about the size of a sketch book.
We gifted this to our 10 year old grandson who has developed an interest in drawing! It was perfect for him! Looks very nice and the case it comes in is nice!
This was definitely worth the price.  It even had its own cover bookMy granddaughter loved it
It was a gift for someone. She loved it.

These Kalour soft core colored pencils, 72 set, exceeded my expectations! The vibrant pigments and smooth application make coloring a delightful experience. The blendability is fantastic, allowing for beautiful transitions between shades. There are Many main shades of colors to make blending seamless. For example, there are at least 10 to 15 shades of green and at least 10 shades of purple. On the back of the packaging, there is a swatch list which has the number and the color And the name for each of the 72 shades. I found that already made swatch list helpful when picking a color theme. The sturdy build ensures durability, and the wide range of colors provides endless creative possibilities. There are color, pencils that I like better but at this price points I think these are the best softcore pencils that I have come across. Compared to the other well-known softcore colored pencils that start with a P, These are not soft, not as blendable, and not as waxy. But the price is awesome and they do a nice job!  A must-have for artists of all levels!"
"As a student they are really nice and affordable price. I love that it has different colors, smooth and siz is good, sharp, and excellent function"
"This set is beautiful its the perfect size for the money and shares the sharpness, thickness, and durability of its competitors. You can't beat the price for the quality"
"These are nice soft-lead pencils with good colour and a wide selection- I‚Äôve made several illustrations with them so far and I like them! My only complaint is that when sharpening them, I‚Äôve sometimes run into issues with the lead breaking in the pencil as it‚Äôs being sharpened, no matter how carefully I do it; it‚Äôs hard to get a good point on the lead without breaking."
"Got these on sale for incredibly cheap, and they're amazing. The color is nice and I'd personally say they're easy to blend. Nice with alcohol markers, too."
Ery smooth gliding pencils and lots of colors.  Good pricing.  Only negative is box they come in not sturdy.  I‚Äôll have to put them in something else.
I love coloring the cat breed coloring books with these pencils.  The images are grayscale but you really achieve great results by layering the colors.  _ I loved the selection and they are really great to work with.
"These were my first ""soft"" colored pencils so I was not exactly  sure what to expect.  What I discovered was more vibrant colors and more even colors.  I just color for fun so honestly I have no artistic ability.  The colors are more even and the effect is so much more attractive. I whole heatedly give this product an A plus!.  You will enjoy them."
"Bought this for a friend, these are a very nice set. Value for the cost is good. Great variety of colours."
"I already have a larger set of these pencils which  my husband bought from Amazon for me and I love them and use them daily, even though I have other pencil sets which are more expensive. I am ucky enough to own the  500 set ,I have bought this set to take with me on a short break with a minature colouring book and didnt want to carry  a large set around with me. Once I come back they will add to my original set and replace some of those pencils which are now becoming too small.The colours themselves are lovely and there is a good variety in the shades.  They work well for shading, and they also work well on different paper, so for instance the amazon paper. They sharpen easily (just dont make them really pointy as the point tends to snap off even when colouring lightly), They are easy to hold and I find I can erase them when making errors.I would definately recommend you buy these to start your colouring journey or as a gift for someone, in fact buy a larger size you wont be disappointed."
"I recently purchased art supplies from Posca Markets for my daughters, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. The selection of Posca markers available is incredible, offering a wide range of vibrant colors and various nib sizes. My daughters were thrilled with their new markers and have been creating beautiful artwork ever since.The quality of the Posca markers is outstanding. They produce such rich, vibrant colors and are versatile enough to be used on different surfaces. It's been a joy to see my daughters' creativity blossom with these high-quality tools.Overall, Posca Markets has exceeded our expectations, providing top-notch art supplies that have made my daughters super happy. I highly recommend Posca Markets to any parent looking to inspire their children's creativity!"
"These are so smooth and nice, the colors are vibrant,didnâ€™t seep through the page, no horrible smell, covers the page, very saturated and good quality markers."
"These are bold in their color, and are a great deal for this amount of markers. Easy to use and high quality. Highly recommend if you need an indoor kid activity."
"This was a great product! Loved the colors and variety, and really pretty and good quality! Recommend!"
the colors are deep and true to what is expected. the markers do not pass through the paper. they are great for painting on glass or any material and easy to wash off. also great for paper.
i first bought these markers a little over 2 years ago. used them a bunch and then moved/gained other hobbies which led me to not using them for over a year. well i picked up painting again and these markers still work as though i never stopped using them. definitely worth the price!
"Beautiful, vivid colors that apply easily! These markers are wonderful quality and worth getting if you can get a discount (it's pretty expensive otherwise). Product photograph is misleading as the markers don't come in a single box; I received 29 unique colors, but it was spread out between 2 smaller sets and some loose markers. However, everything was brand new and in good condition, and each loose marker was encased in shrink-wrap for protection, soAlso, I've seen some reviews talking about ""Chinese"" writing on the markers which is wince-inducing; Posca is from the Japanese brand Mitsubishi and the labels are in Japanese! Just FYI since apparently it's too difficult for people to tell that's the case ðŸ™„. It doesn't mean the markers are fake. The marker set includes all of the colors available to the Japanese market from what info I can find, which means there are some USA colors not included in the set and some colors specific to Japanese Posca markers. If you want some of the exclusive USA metallic colors, for instance, you'll have to buy another set."
"I donâ€™t love that u canâ€™t do a second coat on some surfaces. Color options arenâ€™t great, would prefer dual or brush tips, a tad pricey, would love a case, but good paint pens for sure."
"I saw the amount of positive reviews and decided to take a chance.  These are at a very low cost, (these are $9/pen at my local art house), so even though these were ""cheap"" it still felt like an enormous purchase for me.What can I say? These were worth every penny! They don't take long to prime, the tip is a nice felt rather than hard pastic, so the lines are smooth and theres no blops falling out and being pushed around like with other brands I tried before. The tips are reversible too! I was thrilled to see that frugal me will be able to squeeze every drop from them.The colours are true to the cap, so no guesswork when selecting.So far if I could give these more than 5 stars I would, they appear to be the real Posca deal and not a cheap knock off!I was worried bc the 1 star reviews made me worry I made a mistake, but there were relatively few so I took a chance.  For me this is something I would really be sad I didn't take advantage of.The coverage is incredible, even when marking the blacks caps, they showed up solidly and vividly.Every single one worked well, there were none dry, no leaking in the package as with some of the negative reviews.As an artist who has sold plenty of work and taught in a gallery I see these suiting your needs well!"
"Good, but not worth 10k. 2-3k is a reasonable price for this."
"Crayola Air Dry Clay is a versatile and user-friendly option for crafting enthusiasts of all ages. It‚Äôs especially popular for children and beginners because it doesn‚Äôt require any special equipment to harden‚Äîjust leave it out, and it dries naturally within 24-48 hours. This makes it a fantastic choice for those who don‚Äôt have access to a kiln or want a low-maintenance alternative to traditional clay.Texture & Workability:The texture of the clay is soft and pliable right out of the package, which makes it easy to mold and shape. It doesn‚Äôt stick too much to your hands, which is great for working on detailed projects. It‚Äôs an excellent medium for creating sculptures, ornaments, pinch pots, and other crafts. Kids will especially love how easy it is to handle and shape.Drying Process:One of the main advantages is the air-dry feature. There‚Äôs no need for baking or firing in a kiln, which eliminates the risks and difficulties associated with traditional clay. However, you do need to give it ample time to fully dry, and thicker projects may take longer. While it dries well, be aware that larger or thicker pieces might develop some minor cracks during the drying process, which can usually be smoothed out or fixed with additional clay.Durability:Once dry, Crayola Air Dry Clay has a solid but somewhat brittle finish. While it holds its shape well, it‚Äôs not as durable as kiln-fired clay. If you‚Äôre working on projects that need to withstand wear and tear, you might want to reinforce them or handle them with care. That said, it‚Äôs still great for lightweight decorative items, school projects, or pieces that will be used indoors.Customization & Painting:One of the best features of this clay is that it can be painted once dry. You can use acrylic paints, watercolors, or even markers to add color and details to your creations. The surface of the dried clay is smooth and easy to decorate, allowing for vibrant, personalized designs. You can also seal your finished pieces with a varnish or sealant to add a protective layer and enhance durability.Clean-Up & Storage:Another major advantage is the ease of clean-up. The clay washes off hands and surfaces with just water, making it ideal for parents or teachers supervising younger kids. Unused clay can be stored in an airtight container to keep it soft and ready for future projects, but be sure to seal it well, as it can dry out if exposed to air.Final Thoughts:Crayola Air Dry Clay is a fantastic product for both novice and experienced crafters. It‚Äôs easy to mold, requires no baking, and allows for endless creativity. While it may not be as durable as traditional fired clay, it‚Äôs an excellent choice for decorative projects and a fun, mess-free activity for kids. The ability to paint and customize finished pieces makes it even more versatile, offering a full range of creative possibilities!"
"I bought this to make my own vases and magnets. For a beginner, this is great! I like that you can paint over it once it dries, so you can make your art any color! The quality is good, it is easy to use and maintain. It does crack a little on some projects, but it depends. It gets super sticky when you wet it, and can be pretty messy. It is a soft texture though, it is fun to use!"
"I purchased this to make crafts with the grandchildren.  The first order arrived with the tub cracked, but was quickly replaced.  We first made ghosts for Halloween and it was easy to roll (even for the 3yo with a little help)."
"For a senior year high school project last year, I made the colosseum almost entirely out of this clay. My time limit was around 2 months, and I put almost 80 hours into this project. It ended up sitting on a 16-inch long base and weighed in at 6.8 pounds when completely dry. I used approximately 2 of the 5 pound containers. I don't think this clay is perfect, but I think of all of the options out there, this has to be the best option when making large projects and not having the option of kiln firing.Cracking is to be expected. When adding water to the clay or simply using it straight out of the package the moisture takes up a lot of space and naturally, it is going to shrink when dry. I ended up using cracks to determine where the weak points were. When filling in cracks ALWAYS overfill the crack, the clay that you put in is going to shrink, and it's easier to shave down bumps than continuing to fill in cracks that don't seem to go away.I found that carving this clay was easier than molding it. I included a picture of the details on the interior, they were for the most part entirely made by carving clay out of each row. This clay is really hard to make small shapes and strings with, so if your project is small or has tons of tiny details I would suggest picking up modeling clay instead, although making small details IS still possible, just more time-consuming.Joining pieces of clay together can be a challenge, I found that adding lots of water and smoothing down the sides of the piece you want to join to the project. Trying to join pieces in the ""traditional"" way (making a few lines in either piece, adding water, and pressing together) does not work with this clay, it's very stubborn.I had a big issue when starting this project as to where I was going to put it. I decided on a cardboard base, but I couldn't get the clay to stick very well. I found that gluing paper down to the cardboard and adding a thin layer of water to the top got the clay to stick. after the first layer, I had to deal with shrinking and added a second piece of cardboard to the bottom, since it bent the first one.Another trick I found was mixing acrylic paint directly into the clay can change the color and you can mix other materials into the clay- I used both of these on the sandy floor of the colosseum, beige paint and actual sand were mixed in and the clay worked just as it normally would.I seriously enjoyed working with this material, you get a ton for the price, and it works really well. This project was the first time I had ever made something large and to scale with clay, and while it does come with a learning curve, I really enjoy recreating places with it. Currently, I am working on a model of Mont St Michele, and after I will be working on making the Statue of Liberty"
very good quality clayboth of my kids were able to create different projectsits a good quality clay ( please keep in mind it can stain)to keep it from drying out (unused portions ) either zip lock it or keep it refrigerated
Bought it for my son‚Äôs school project. It molds well and dried hard in about 2 days. Only complaint is that i noticed 1 crack on the little Indian hut he made as it dried but that‚Äôs probably to be expected.
"Great product! I would recommend. Durable, doesn't smell, and perfect texture and easy to work with. Perfect for crafters and kid activities!"
"For a family fun activity we made so many neat, fall-time decorations for our home. It was fast drying and easy to paint up. To seal, we used a matte mod podge"
Perfect for school projects!
Got for my daughter who loves doing art. Great price and paper is good quality
"Great quality for the price. I purchased for my son he was always complaining about his drawing fading or when he pants it bleeds though . Now he doesn’t have those problems with this drawing book he love the texture pages, no bleeding because of the thickness of the paper GREAT BUY"

The heavy paper does not bleed through
My granddaughter loves it!
Great sketch pad for my grandbaby she loves to draw pages are nice and thick and sturdy she loves it
"Size, quality and price were great for this sketch book that my son needed for his art class"
Came in good shape. Awesome quality. I will be purchasing again
I love these markers. I'm an adult that enjoys coloring. These markers are great for vibrant colors. The different tips allow me to add details to my projects.
"Crayola has been around forever. But they have not lost their quality. These were perfect for my project. I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on the professional ones out there. But, I didn’t want to buy cheap and low quality either. These were exactly what I needed. I would continue to recommend them for anyone doing general projects - school boards, school art, arts & crafts projects around the house, etc. The dual ends are perfect. They are ergonomic fir adults, simple enough for beginners and young ones to use. The colors are exact, they do not over saturate or bleed through the paper, poster board & they're ez wash-yeah, who is going to lie & claim they NEVER get markers on your skin while using them (any brand?)"

Purchased for my 9 y/o who is just getting into drawing. It’s a nice beginner set and has just enough colors."
"Crayola has really upped their game with the adult coloring world. This includes the brand new brush markers coming from Crayola for all your calligraphy needs. Modern calligraphy is getting huge and these are perfectly priced for beginners and even for experts alike. Tombows are popular but Crayola is priced right as being a good beginner style marker to start off with until you're comfortable buying a more expensive brand. These markers have two tips - a brush tip and a smaller, finer brush tip. Each comes in two different colors. The brush tip is just slightly darker than it's counter end of the finer brush tip. 16 markers in all, with 32 different colors but about 16 different colors with two-toned shades of each color.I learned very quickly these are something that you have to use delicately. The brush tip is great for good thick strokes going down and soft light strokes going up but I've learned too quickly that pressing too hard on a brush tip pen will fray the tip. I would actually strongly advise using a regular Crayola or another brand marker in the fat/thin variables first and get your drills down and then once you've mastered the drills and build up your muscles in your wrist and hand to venture into these brush pens as well. Lettering is an art form and like any art form, it takes practice and technique to get it down. I definitely suggest buying these but feel comfortable with the strokes and drills of the lettering as well.I think that the experts of the lettering world will love these as a comparative marker to the other name brand markers and brush pens out there to do just as good of a job. I just wish I would have really practiced my techniques and drills before going fully into learning with these and ultimately fraying a few of the ends of the bigger brush tips.Beginner, expert, novices, all rejoice!  These are some beautiful brush pens at a great affordable price to give you two shades of color to practice gradient, brush techniques, and so much more. They also come in a very nice tin box to store in. I will be getting more practice in and  be sure to lighten my hand a little before purchasing again but you can bet I will be purchasing another set of these - so don't stop creating awesome things, Crayola!"
"This is a great set of markers if you are interested in beginning to color. I would recommend this set for adults and children alike. The colors are vibrant, the colors really stand out, and they blend well."
"I write with them, draw and paint with them. I also sketch with them."
"My daughter is very artsy and was interested in trying some calligraphy for fun.  These brush pens were a great option because the pack has so many colors.  Each pen has a brush side and a point side as well.Crayola is very dependable in their quality, and that does not change for this product.  None of the pens are dried out or seem to any time soon.The set was a bit expensive in my opinion, but it seems that all brush pen sets are.  I went with this set because it was on the cheaper side and I knew Crayola wouldn't disappoint."
Yellow detail tip is the colour of a highlighter. Otherwise its a decent product for the price
Very nice and good quality
They were great
Nice quality.
The durability of the pencils are great if you do not color or write hard. The appearance is exactly like the photo. Be performance is great. The colors are vibrant. The versatility is great you can choose from pencil to paint to paint to markers. Age range is 8 and up.
"I had these on a wish list for my daughter and a few months before her birthday they dropped to 40% off. It's a large kit, easy to keep organized, great for an aspiring artist. She loves some of the unexpected elements, like the knife, and uses it in ways I would never have imagined, including painting, sculpting, and shading."
"I purchased this art supply kit for a young family member who is passionate about art. This includes participating in art fairs and drawing classes as well as writing children’s books featuring her adopted cat, Mike. When the kit arrived, I was pleased to see that it was beautifully packaged and contained a wide range of colors and accessories – making the kit versatile and impressive! The set features a wide and diverse range of colors. Each is represented beautifully and the carrying case makes it suitable for travel, both to and from school and everywhere in between. The colors stayed sharp and vibrant, and my family member has seen a dramatic uptick in the quantity and quality of her artwork."
The kit have many options included to draw and have a good time.
