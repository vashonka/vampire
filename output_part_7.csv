"I am so happy with this purchase and can‚Äôt wait to get my gaming pc set up!! First shipping was not too bad‚Ä¶.when I got the desk the packaging was high quality so I didn‚Äôt have a million little white styrofoam balls all over the room, they even tied a red string to the tool/screw kit so it was easy to spot. They even had removable protectors on the corners of the table tops‚Ä¶.Putting it together was a breeze super easy and concise directions everything needed to put together the desk was included. It‚Äôs sturdy, clean and esthetically pleasing. The size is perfect for my space not too big and bulk but big enough for me to work and play ‚Ä¶.Would make this purchase over a million times again highly recommend!!!"
I did this for my son‚Äôs set up and it fits perfectly in his room and is not too difficult to install. It‚Äôs also very good for its price.Highly recommended.
"It is such an ideal desk for my room and it looks so clean, i can imagine the other colors coming in looking nicer, especially the white one.I did see other reviews w people getting it shipped broken and or chipped but this came perfectly. (now this doesn't speak for everyone but i was fortunate to have it not shipped broken)The set up in all reality should be around the 45 and 1 hr 30 mark. it took me 1hr to set up only due to me having to repeat procedures that i just didn‚Äôt read properly.now of course, i can‚Äôt mention durability hence me just barely getting it yesterday but for the time being, this look really sturdy and looks like it can carry much, the TV is really out of place and also overboard for weight, so i will eventually replace this with a 24 inch monitor and a new kb+m just to make it look much better.The setup was allot easier than i made it out to be to begin w/ the tools were in the bag w the assorted number and pieces.the pocket compartment is the most underrated  thing with this desk, It‚Äôs beautiful for storing anything without you having to put it on the desk and making the desk look ugly and unorganized. with the pocket, it just looks so nice and you can sort really anything in there. I have a lot of controllers, have a lot of cords in there and it‚Äôs sorted really well, so I feel like if you really wanted to get this and if you really feel like you‚Äôre in need for a L-shaped desk especially for $70, I feel like this is really good I would recommend this to anyone else who are on a budget and are trying to make a set up of some type of gaming or maybe just need it for work.reason that I bought this was due to me wanting to play my video games without me having to move to a different place in my room or maybe having to even like use a book bag or a textbook for me being able to use my notebook for writing or even my school computer.this is just nice, but it is not ideal to have a TV of my size like you can see picture in the review on this because it really does take up most of the room and most weight so I am, again, as I said, on the lookout for a maybe 24 inch monitor, 24 inch TV, whatever it may be. I am going to try to look for it and then I‚Äôm going to be trying to get every other thing to make this L-shaped desk look a lot cleaner."
"I recently set up this desk in my home office, and I‚Äôm pleased with it. The modern design fits perfectly with my decor, and the ability to assemble it as either L-shaped or U-shaped is a huge plus. It was pretty easy to put together, though I did spend about a few hours on it.The desk feels sturdy, and the side storage bag is great for keeping my accessories organized. One minor issue is that the screws may fall apart from time to time, so you might need to check them occasionally. Other than that, it‚Äôs been a solid buy with plenty of room for my computer and other gear. Recommend it for those looking for a stylish and functional desk on a budget!"
"This desk is pretty solid, it took just enough space in my corner of the room. It was easy to build but was difficult doing it by myself. It is very light to pick up and move around your room if you want to change up places. It‚Äôs good. üëç"
"I like that this fits perfectly in the corner of the room I chose so I can work comfortably from home. Didn‚Äôt take long to assemble. Only took 30 minutes. For the price, I believe it‚Äôs well worth it. It‚Äôs not heavy and weighs less than 40lbs. So it‚Äôs easy to carry throughout the home if you wanted to switch things up a bit. It also arrived a couple days earlier than expected which was a nice surprise. For size reference I have x2 27‚Äù monitors set up comfortable enough for me to have room to work and my cats to sit and watch as they please. All in all, I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase."
"The photos and illustrations of this desk make it look bigger than it actually is.  I think the best candidate to use this desk is someone with not much stuff to place onto it in a very neat, straight-forward setup, not someone who expects to be able to ""spread out"" and be a little messy.  For someone like me, with a long history of laying out two folding tables in an ""L"" shape to use as a ""virtual desk"", a work surface this small seriously won't do.  What makes it worse, assembly is a pretty big process, making it especially daunting if at the end, one realizes the desk is not a fit.  The instructions SHOULD start with a ""quick start"" section giving the reader a choice of places to begin reading based on the desired desk orientation.  Instead, an addendum showing how to orient the desk the ""other"" way follows the full set of instructions on how to set it up the ""first"" way.  Backtracking to the decision point is a pretty big chore after completing assembly and deciding to switch.  For me, I had twice the chore, when I realized I needed to disassemble and re-pack the desk kit into its tiny shipping box.  I've moved onto a larger, simpler to assemble desk, which seems a much better fit for me."
"This desk was super easy for me to put together by myself with the included tools. The instructions were pretty clear and easy to follow, so as long as you pay attention to what direction things go, assembly should be a breeze. It also only took about 30-40 minutes to put together.Now that it is all assembled, I love it! It feels pretty sturdy and it looks really nice! Conveniently, the finish also matches some monitor stands I already had, so that's a bonus.Overall, this is a very nice looking, easy to assemble, and inexpensive desk."
"The instructions were easy to follow, the desk is sturdy, and it looks exactly as advertised."
"Fairly easy to build, best of all very sturdy. Plenty of space for workflow."
This is a good choice for a decent corner desk. Quality matches price.
My husband and I ordered two of these and they were both delivered so quickly and in two medium size boxes with all the pieces needed and instructions. Super easy to put together! Looks great in our game room! Looks just like the pictures
"I bought this for my wife's home office. As a light-duty desk it is perfect.Some caveats... This is NOT fine furniture made of 1"" hardwood.  It does NOT have heavy duty hardware and structural members. If you want to use this roughly, you should plan on buying used and/or paying a LOT more.But for around $90 this is well-designed, well-made, fairly easy to assemble, and seems like it will stand up to light-to-medium duty for many years.Assembly:Parts are all clearly marked, including bolts. All nuts are already embedded in the wood, so you just line up the metal, and insert the supplied bolts. There are very few written directions, but there are about 6 steps of very clear pictures that need to be followed. It took me about 45 minutes by myself (not working very hard). I had NO problems with part alignment as another user suggested - my guess is they didn't follow instructions.The only suggestion I would make is to put in all the bolts hand tight first, then when everything is adjusted, gently tighten all the bolts.Some things I particularly liked:Parts and bolts were clearly marked.Clear pictures.Single-tool assembly (an Allen wrench) and they provided three of them!All bolts were separately packaged, with correct count.They even went the extra mile and enclosed a bag that contained one extra tool, one extra of each size of bolt, and one extra foot.What didn't I like?Really nothing. I might wish for something a bit more heavy-duty, but for $90 I think I got more than what I paid for.It was a bargain. My wife loves it!"
"loved everything about this desk, best of all took me 1 hr to build alone and set up"
Not as described.  Very cheaply made.  Was missing screws. I'm sure my husband can fix it up but save your money.  Very disappointed.  I bought two of them !  Too expensive for what they are.
"I had to review this product because the reviews were mixed and almost turned me off from ordering these pieces.  I'm so glad I didn't!  The desk was super easy to assemble (by myself) and very sturdy and nice looking.  I may get another one.  The filing cabinet was a bit more tricky, but after a helpful call to the Tribesman customer center, I was directed to a very helpful video that quickly answered my question and I was able to continue assembling the cabinet (by myself) with little issue.  Note, the directions only have pictures so it was great that there was a video available.  All-in-all, even though it took me nearly all day to put the pieces together, I would definitely buy this product again.  This is probably the first time that all of the holes lined up properly and I had all the pieces."
"The two pieces--the desk and the lateral file cabinet--are quite different.  The desk rates 5 stars, but I have dropped my overall review by a star because of the lateral file cabinet.  I'd still buy it, but see below for more details.First, the desk is extremely solid, and well packaged--maybe even over-packaged, considering it's mostly steel and almost impossible to damage.  It went together easily, and looks good.Second, the lateral piece.  This is made entirely of pressed wood, and as such is less sturdy.  It's well made, but in my experience pressed wood can develop issues with the fasteners.  While it was thoroughly packed in Styrofoam, one piece arrived damaged: There was minor (really cosmetic) damage to one corner, but more importantly the rail (that the drawer slides on) had broken entirely off.  I wrote to customer service, expecting they would ship a new piece; instead, they suggested I repair it, and offered a hefty partial refund if I would do that.  When I got it in my shop, I realized that all three screws holding the rail had pulled out, leaving holes in the pressed board that would not reliably hold the screws.  I went ahead and put those screws back in, but used wood glue to give it more strength.  I then realized that there were additional holes in the rail, so I drilled small holes in the pressed board and used three more #6 screws there.  I am confident this will hold up, and the partial refund was nice.The instructions for assembling the desk were great; not so the instructions for assembling the lateral piece.  Here are notes I made as I went along, keyed to the steps in the instructions.  Some are probably obvious, but just in case.Pieces W-3 are in a plastic bag.  A few of them somehow locked together during shipment (see my photo), and were difficult to separate.  I found that a screw driver in each piece was needed to separate them.Pieces W-5 are shown in the parts diagram but are not mentioned in the instructions, and are not needed.  I think they were for the handles, but the handles come in a bag with their own screws.2. Make sure piece #4 is lined up with the front of piece #1, and does not cover the groove at the back of #1 (it's possible to get #4 backwards).  Also, pieces W-2 go into *both* sides of piece #4, unlike the instructions which show W-2 on only one side.  Screw these pieces in evenly on the two sides (it's possible to screw one side in too far, then the other won't go in far enough).  Insert these screws *before* inserting piece #3 (pieces 2 and 4 will tilt far enough to fit #3 in, provided you insert the posts on one side of piece #3 before trying to line up the other side).3. Again, pieces W-2 go on *both* sides of piece 5, and make sure the front of #5 lines up with the front of #1.5. Make sure piece #8 goes *all* the way down in the groove in piece #1, or you'll have difficulty later.6. It's unclear from the diagram, but piece #16 fits along almost the entire length of the lower and upper pieces #8.7. There are no pre-drilled holes for the screws, which is why my caution at step 5.  Best to ensure that both #8 pieces are down as far as they can go before using the screws.  The top #8 should stick up about 1/4"" over pieces 2, 4, 5 and 7.8. There's a lot to line up here: not only the W-2 pieces sticking up, but also piece #8 has to go into the groove in the bottom of #9 all the way across.  Easiest is to line up all the W-2s, then slightly screw in the W-3s at the front, then make sure #8 is in the groove before screwing in the back W-3s.10. The instructions don't mention attaching the handles, although I guess it's obvious.  However, the screws that hold the handles on are slightly too long.  I used washers on the inside to make up the difference.In the end, everything went together.  There are a few extra screws and stuff (in addition to the above-mentioned W-5s), which is nice.  The result looks nice, the desk is sturdy, and the lateral file cabinet rolls easily (even on a rug)."
I like the finished product.  Wish there was a video guide or better instructions for the cabinet.  Took me about 5 to 6 hrs.  Few extra screws included. Desk and file cabinet was two separate shipments which I wasnt originally told.  I would deduct a star but my wife loves it. Seems to be good value and quality.
"Great desk with solid construction. Got this for wifey, and since she is shorter, she needed a lower desk.  This worked perfectly.FYI - there are lots of pieces to put this together."
"This desk looks as advertised- nice and sleek. It’s a little smaller than anticipated but mostly because my computer monitor is much larger than pictured, and I transitioned from a larger desk to this. It will definitely work for the space and again, looks nice. I’ve received several compliments already. I will say though, for someone who is not a builder of any sort, it was not easy to put together. I understood the direction fine, however there was a ton of screws that needed to be screwed in and no holes to help place them. If I was more patient, I would have let someone more experienced put it together for me."
"Very disappointing. The included instructions do not match the pieces and when you finally figure out how to assemble it you will be left with many parts. It hardly resembles the photos and description provided.It comes in two heavy boxes. We opted to return the desk and while the request was approved we were sent a single return label using the US Postal Service, without postage. The USPS would not take it due to the weight and there was only one label for two boxes.When we originally called AZ to intervene, we were told they would arrange with the seller to pick it up and provide the correct UPS labels.we were expected to hear from someone within 72 hours. 96 hours later we had to call AZ again who told us the China based company had not responded and our only option was to arrange with UPS to pick it up and provide AZ with the receipt at which time AZ would reimburse us for the shipping.If you enjoy cheap, poorly made furniture that comes at a premium price - this item is for you.Us… we ordered online from IKEA and the desk was less expensive and beautifully made…. And more importantly, the instructions matched the parts perfectly."
Very nice desk but assembly instructions were missing from box.
"Arrived on time, good value for the money, easy to assemble, good quality"
"This is just what I needed for my daily work from home desk. I work for a busy insurance company and we work remotely. This desk hits everything I need and more! Easy to put together. My 8 year old granddaughter and I put it together ourselves.  Plenty of room, I bought the 48 inch desk. I have 3 very large monitors and a large laptop. I still have plenty of space. It comes with wire connectors that are amazing and hold everything in one place! Motor is super quiet and has preset buttons as well. Great find, great price well worth the time and price. I spent  100.00 on this beauty and would do it again. Highly recommended."
"Assembly: the instructions are easy to follow, which made putting the table together a breeze.Looks: The table looks great; I like the rustic brown color that I got. I think it is well made. The tiny gap in the middle, because the top came in two pieces, does not bother me. I think it adds to the aesthetics. Lol.Functionality: Height adjustments are very nice. You can save four different height settings. The motor runs smoothly, and the noise is very minimal."
I needed an adjustable desk but never bought one before. This works perfectly in both sitting/standing configurations and raises/lowers in seconds to the desired height. It was easy to build too. I wish the motor had a straight 3-prong plug-in but I won't ding it for that. I'm very happy with this purchase.
"The installation instructions could be more detailed but you can manage, it's simple. Durable and have purchased a second one. One thing is that you need a phillips screw driver, not provided with the package. There is a small tool for some screws but you need a screw driver to complete the set up.The deliver was fast as indicated in the purchase. Overall happy and recommend the product."
"I like the wood grain color of the table,Very sturdy and durable"
This desk was very easy to assemble and is very sturdy for the price point! Wouldn’t go back to not having it that’s for sure! Works great with my walking pad!
"I wanted a sit-stand desk for home use. After researching, I chose this one. The package arrived damaged, as the desk is heavy, but all parts were present. I put the desk together - took a couple of hours. The desk portion is fiberboard. It comes with a plastic cable-holder for under the desk that is attached using three screws. That did not work - all three screws broke the fiberboard - it just flaked off. The electrical system works, instructions were adequate. It supports two monitors, keyboard and mouse, and the powerstrip-surge protector. I placed the laptop on a file cabinet next to it, and checked to make sure the cords were adequate and didn't get trapped. Not perfect, but functional."
"This is a 3 Star quality table.  It goes up and down, no worries.  Have been using it with a heavy monitor and laptop for a few weeks.  Only issue is the monitor arm is clamped on the back table top and it is now curving due to the stress of holding the monitor in position.  I am guessing that 3/4"" Plywood is in my future to replace this thin, cheap particle board.  If you want a basic standing desk and are not planning to put a monitor arm on it, this is a great buy, especially at this price.  Got what I expected, content buyer."
"It takes a little while to put together, but clear instructions,and plenty of hardware. Easy to assemble. Looks great and functions just aswell."
This desk assembles easily and is sturdy.  Really like the extra outlet on the desk. The design is perfect for right handed users.  The extra file cabinet on wheels is a great idea.
I was back and forth about getting this desk! I’m so glad I did! It’s very sturdy and well built! It’s exactly what I needed for my work at home job and I have plenty of space! The price was great too!
I’m happy with the desk. It’s definitely an upgrade from my last desk I had. It was also easy to put together.  instructions is very clear and even breaks down for both right side and left side setup.
"I have two similar desks and this one is 10x better. Super stable, sucks to put together but wasn’t bad"
"All hardware provided for assembly was provided + spare hardware, very easy to assemble as the assembly manual is well written and includes many photos and parts numbers showing the hardware needed and location"
Desk came in without damage and was easy to install. Directions were very clear. It is also very strudy and doesnt look cheap either.
This is a great desk. Easy to put together and feels very sturdy. It has adjustable feet so you can level it to the floor so it dosent wobble. It looks great and the leds are very bright. Fit in the space I had designated for it perfectly. And was the best price I could find for a desk with this many features.
"Never saw myself spending as much as I did on this desk! Worth it, especially for the quality of it.The set up did take way longer than expected, but even after reading the reviews I was determined to beat it (4 hours by myself). It’s pretty straight forward though you have to be careful with all the different holes in the bars and make sure they are facing the right way, mostly so you don’t have to go back after you realized you made a mistake. Thankfully, I only had one mishap.It is also a hardy desk, I keep my ten gallon fish tank and tv plus a whole bunch of other stuff on it and there doesn't seem to be any concern of breakage.I love every bit of this desk and how well everything turned out, if you’re concerned about quality I’d say that it definitely matches the price."
"This is hard to explain... because overall it does the expected job just fine, I can't truly complain. But 3 maybe 4 gripes stick out to me with this desk.1. Assembly instructions were fine up until the part where you're assembling the area where the drawer goes. There's a track it slides on, and that's fine, but the instructions say to place the adjacent bolts above the track with the nuts pointed in towards where the drawer would go, effectively blocking the drawer from the track. I took the liberty to reverse that so the drawer can properly slide along the track and you should too, it works great that way. However, I'm not a fan of a canvas drawer, but I digress.2. The light strip they include is nice, but the adhesive is not very reliable. I ended up buying some double-sided Gorilla tape to get a better stick and it hasn't fallen since.3. When screwing the hardware into the bottoms of the desktops, you have to be careful not to over tighten, which doesn't take much, because the bolt you're screwing in will begin to push through the surface and damage the work surface above. I had to back out and glue it back down, other spots I didn't go far enough to penetrate but there is a bulge, and I don't like it.4. Just a generally thin table. You get a lot for the money, so I'm not complaining, and what you don't get... you got what you paid for, so it's fine, though my previous desk was smaller and less expensive but much better quality and heft to it... perhaps it's just a sign of the times.Overall, it looks fantastic in my office, the lights can be controlled with either the remote or your phone via Bluetooth, it adds office workspace, it's comfortable to sit at, the reversible option when building is great, the extra storage above is a Godsend for me, still good quality for the money, if you need something heavier, spend more money. Oh, and the on-desk outlets are great for my mother when she comes over to do work, she doesn't have to reach down below to plug in her stuff."
"This desk is very easy to put together, and is very sturdy! Both the built in drawer and side compartment is very handy and useful. Also the extra storage beneath the desk is amazing! I ended up putting a mini fridge on the bottom shelf to replace the space. My favorite part about the desk is the power strip. It is super helpful and has many slots for different cords/chargers. Next, the 3 compartments above the desk are a nice touch, and gives you extra storage. In my opinion, it makes the desk look really good, and ties everything together. The only downside to this desk is the LED strip, due to the poor adhesive. After I completely assembled the desk, it didn’t take more than a few hours for the adhesive to start falling down, even with the screw on attachments to hold it up. Overall this is an amazing purchase, I would recommend."
"Purchased as a gift, so I guess I'll (Mom) do the review because they just paid for it. It was bought for the ""Mom"" cave, sewing room. Put it together by myself in about 3 hours of daytime TV ( Maury to the People's Court) with very few issues. I do agree with the other reviews.....drill! If you're good with puzzles, the directions will be a piece if cake. Some pieces weren't marked but you can figure it out through process of elimination and, if ya really have to, singing ""One of these things is not like the other"" seems to help. Keep an eye on the direction of your posts so you don't have to disassemble anything (ask me how I know that!). It does seem sturdy, holds all 3 sewing machines with tons of space, has purdy lights and looks much nicer than what I had."
"Looks relatively nice for the price. The materials are lightweight as a consequence of being a budget desk, but it's assembled and designed in a way that makes it sturdy, regardless. I would 100% buy this again, and for the price, I have no gripes, however, if I were to nitpick:Hooks to hang headphones would have been nice.The drawer is basically just cardboard and fabric. A drawer made of manufactured wood would have been nice.The LED strip has useless adhesive. I used Gorilla Glue branded sticky putty, which is a great solution.The adjustable feet can only raise the desk about 1/2inch. Another 1/2 inch would have been ideal. My office chair can just barely slide in with some rubbing of the arms.The assembly took about 4 hours, and I spent about 30 more minutes later making some adjustments.Overall I am very happy with my purchase, and for the price, it cannot be beaten."
I have nothing but good things to say about this desk. From home sturdy it is to the space and how it still manages to pack a punch in my work environment while still fitting nicely tucked into a corner without giving me stuffy oversized vibes.  Relatively easy to put together however be mindful. The instructions may have took a little confused if you are setting it up the opposite to the original direction . The long draw is great for keeping things close and handy and the shelving as you can see comes in clutch.
Very sturdy & very spacious. You guys kudos to you. It was so easy to put together. Thank you. Good product.
"Sturdy desk, excellent storage, cloth drawers so there wasnt the extra slide tracks to install. Perfect for my kids, their papers, pencils, fidget toys, double screens, keyboards, and gaming accessories.Would not recommend for laptops, no space to work."
"Overall I like the desk, especially with the multiple drawers that provide a lot of storage space. So many modern desks have nothing to offer storage wise! The four stacked ones are fabric, so it's not exactly a luxury one, but when closed they are fully covered so they look pretty good and you can't see the inside.The desk is pretty sturdy and looks good overall. Assembly is kind of a pain, it's not terrible but be prepared for several hours. Aside from assembly, five stars—especially considering the price."
This was easy to put together. Very sturdy. A place for everything!  Just wondering if the power strip is a power surge strip. If not it would be an excellent addition.
This desk has a lot of storage. Love the spot for the printer gives a ton of counter space. Great piece for the money. easy to put together.
"This is a compact desk yet big enough to accommodate three monitors, love the drawers and enough space for my printer. Very satisfied."
"Desk is a little more shallow than I expected and it was way more difficult to put together then it needed to be. Go slow and pay attention to the directions so you don't make any extra holes.It's sturdy enough and looks pretty good. I fastened two 32"" monitors to the top part of the desk and was able to place my PC on the side portion that is a little lower. I'll probably fasten the straps holding the monitors to the walls soon to give my a little extra security but overall it holding the weight of both and the PC fine.I was missing a few screws and contacted the seller. They shipped out a whole new pack of hardware. Everything works like it should. I'd only change the design to be a little bit deeper on the desk portion, but that my preference."
"Functionality isn’t quite there with this one. I wish they would have made this desk so you could use either a desktop OR laptop, so it’s uncomfortably cramped even with an iPad. I’d say that is the most irritating design flaw on this desk. The pictures are intentionally deceptive and look like you have WAY more room than you actually have. Not terribly heavy for a desk, but cumbersome to move because it is a tad flimsy, especially where the printer part “connects” to the desk.So anyway we have to take the top part for the monitors off which really sucks because I wanted to use the light strip underneath. The fabric drawers aren’t even IKEA quality. I’d say this is a good desk for a 12 year old boy who leaves Mountain Dew cans all over his bedroom floor and doesn’t appreciate nice things. If you’re an adult that wants a desk that doesn’t look like a Walmart reject, I’d spend the extra $100 on something a little better quality. Not a great value for your money."
"It took me months of reading and watching videos to finally decide to buy this brand of food processor. I have not been disappointed one bit! I was really thinking I should save and get a Breville. But I made the plunge that fit my budget much better. I have made pizza dough that turned out wonderful and so fast. I make cauliflower rice all the time. It is so fast and easy. It's definitely better to try to have your floweretts all cut about the same size. I make butter every week which is delicious and fun and I make home made peanut butter that my husband loves. I also have used it now several times for pie dough and empanada dough. It is super fast and easy and has turned out perfectly every time. It is very sturdy and doesn't move at all on the counter while I make my dough. It also grates cheese evenly and with very little waste.. Clean up is pretty easy too. I wash it right after I use it, in hot soapy water and rinse well. The only complaint I have is that there are a couple of places that you can't get in with a towel to dry. But I have found if I just leave it out on a towel for a few hours exposed to the air, those dry completely as well. Also,  I have found that if I dry it with a tea towel it comes out shiny and new looking. I don't use it for chopping garlic, but I tried it once and it worked. It's just easier to do that by hand with little clean up afterward. I wanted to cover these points for you to hopefully make your decision faster than mine.  It works just great and is much more budget friendly. I am very happy with my purchase."
"This is a very sturdy, very powerful and very quiet food processor. I think it’s the third food processor I’ve owned.  I am enjoying the larger bowl size for sure.So far I have used it to make pico de gallo and shredded cabbage for coleslaw and cut onions for hotdogs.  It did a great job for all of it. I used the chopping blade for the pico de Gallo and the onions. And I used the shredding disk attachment for the cabbage for the slaw.At first, I couldn’t get it to turn on, ☺️  but, that’s because I had the feeder tube too full for the metal spine on the back of the pusher to completely engage the safety feature.The biggest drawback I see is the way the safety feature on the lid is designed.  The safety mechanism is sort of open but at the same time closed if that makes any sense. It’s open enough for stuff to get in there and closed enough for you to have a hard time getting food particles out.  You may want to just check and be sure that there’s no food particles On the metal safety spine on the food pusher that you’ll push down into the safety channel on the lid.  Otherwise, you will play the game of rinsing and turning it upside down and swishing it/ flipping while holding the white thingy open until you can get the food particle to come out of it.  There may be a trick to this I haven’t figured out yet.  So far, I really like this processor, And, the prices for extra attachments on the Cuisinart website are very, very competitive with free shipping."
"""Oh, I don't need a food processor. I love to chop things by hand! And really, my cheap, tiny blender does just about any job a food processor could do. It's not worth the money!"" This has been my mantra for years.Oh, what a fool I was. What a fool!A food processor is such a magical device. You can do things with it that are impossible to do without it!Have you heard of cashew cream sauce? It's fabulous. You soak about two cups of cashews in water for 2 hours, drain and rinse them well, and then toss them in your food processor with a clove or two of peeled garlic, about 2/3 cup of water, and about a teaspoon or so of salt, to taste. Press the power on, and in seconds, you have smooth-bodied, flavourful dip that is extremely versatile. From there, it's all up to your imagination! Add some nutritional yeast to make it taste nice and cheesy, with just a pinch of paprika to bring out those cheesy notes, and serve it with tortilla chips. Or how about a bit of curry powder and some basil to serve with pita chips as a sweet, curry-style dip? Or perhaps you'll use some herbs and pour it over pasta, for a new twist on ""lazy pasta night""?Maybe you're no fan of that idea. Well then, how about making pesto right in your own home? Those tiny bottles in the grocery are never as good as the stuff as you can get in a nice restaurant, and they can be damned pricey for such mediocre flavour. Make it yourself, and be amazed!Or what about hummus? You can use a method by Kenji Lopez-Alt over at SeriousEats to make tahini sauce with garlic and lemon that makes for a FANTASTIC base for the best hummus of your life (made with, I suggest, the best on the market, and available also here on Amazon: Soom Foods Pure Ground Sesame Tahini 11oz (2 Pack))! Sabra has got NOTHING on homemade hummus.There's also the sheer joy of buying nuts in bulk, knowing that you're saving quite a bit of money tossing them into your food processor to get chopped rather than buying them pre-chopped. Or you can quickly chop toppings for a salad. There's a lot of chopping this thing can handle that you might not care to handle yourself!Or, how about this: the best homemade ice cream you've ever had? It's simple; make your custard-style base (I recommend Jeni Britton Bauer's method, Google it or pick up her book here: Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home), freeze it overnight in a big gallon freezer bag laid out flat, and the next day, break it into pieces to throw into your food processor. Then you can whip it to a gorgeous creamy state, add in some flavourings, pour into an ice cream container, and freeze; voila! The best homemade ice cream you've EVER had - guaranteed better than storebought, that's for sure, and a lot healthier, since you're in total control of what goes in it. :)And I'm sure before I even began to write this review, you had your own ideas. Nut butters? Certainly! How about dough? It can do it! Grating cheese? Well, I prefer an old-fashioned box grater, but if you're tired of washing that ol' beast, absolutely, go for one of these! There's just so many wonderful things you can do with this gorgeous machine; and it's outrageously simple to handle. I've seen a great many food processors in family homes; they're awkward, they're cumbersome, and they're very noisy. This isn't whisper-silent, but I can safely use it all hours of the night without losing a finger or waking my sleeping household.Now, I must confess I've had precisely one point of frustration with it since I bought it: I opened it up, threw in an ingredient, put the top back on, hit the ""ON"" button, and.. nothing. I was dumbfounded. Why isn't this brand new machine working?Turns out, it was a safety feature! I hadn't secured the top, so it didn't come on. And thank goodness! I would've had a big mess on my hands. Knowing that it will simply not turn on if I don't have the top fastened on correctly is a comfort to me; I can get to work and not worry about double-checking that I've put everything back in place just so, and I can trust little ones to put things into it without worrying that they'll get over-excited to turn it on and send ingredients flying around my kitchen! And it's so simple to put together and take apart once you take a few minutes to handle it first-hand.This is a wonderful machine to aid the home cook, and I believe if you've made it this far in my review, you know I'm right. You deserve this. It'll take a special position in your kitchen, just like a KitchenAid; in fact, a KitchenAid and this food processor have a constant presence on my countertop. If you love to cook, and you love to explore new techniques and recipes, then I beg of you; do yourself a big favour and get this today!"
This is great for making pizza dough to pureeing soups - mine quit after 35 years - this is the same!
"No blister switches to crack and fail,  all the power you need and consistent slicing.  America Test Kitchen top pick,  I can see why.  I liked our prior Cuisinart unit but thus unit is smaller footprint and all the performance."
"The product is probably great, but I haven't had the chance to try it because it is not adapted for the EU market.  I couldn't plug it in, so unfortunately I had to return it"
"Highly recommended! Even though ( or because ) this is an older model, at 600 W, it’s twice as powerful as any of the newer 7 cup  models and Very Quiet. It’s the smaller sized version used in real professional kitchens. Food is beautifully processed with just a light tap on the pedal... giving a pulsed or continuous current and there is no delay in the controls. Easy to use and clean"

It‚Äôs the perfect size for making doughs or large salads, but not so big that it takes up too much space.The processor comes with three sharp and durable blades that handle everything from fine chopping to coarse slicing. The dough blade is especially impressive‚Äîit makes kneading bread or pizza dough effortless.I appreciate the convenience of the food chute and pusher for adding ingredients without stopping the processor. It keeps things moving smoothly and makes processing safer and faster.Not only is this machine solidly built, but it also looks great on my countertop with its sleek silver finish. It's a perfect blend of style and performance.The 1000 watts of power is more than enough for any task, from the softest fruits to tougher vegetables.

This food processor is great. It has shredded zucchini and blocks of cheese with ease. It was a bit more expensive but we decided to upgrade. I like how l it has multiple options and tools. It is high powered. It is large and bulky so we don‚Äôt store it in kitchen. It is loud but efficient, so it‚Äôs only loud for a short time."
"I have a ninja 3 cup chopper/mini food processor that I‚Äôve used for YEARS and it still works perfectly. But I needed something larger. I was nervous because I bought the ninja smoothie bullet type blender a few years back, and while it works well it is painfully loud. This one is NOT, it‚Äôs like a whisper it‚Äôs so quiet. It cuts evenly no matter how much I put in, super clear directions. Love that I can pop it in the dishwasher. I have the base on the counter next to my air fryer tucked under a little hideaway shelf. Easy to pull out, use and push back. The suction cups on the base to keep it sturdy or surprisingly powerful! Very nice touch. So many brands seem to have lost their credibility and have lost my trust. But, Ninja has not, I completely trust their products to be quality, sturdy, easy to use and to last for years and years no matter if it‚Äôs a small or large model."
This food chopper is amazing! I have had it for almost a year now and it works and looks as it did the first time I used it. It has great power. I have never had any issues chopping up whatever I am trying to. The canister is large and does not leak. It has little suction cups on the bottom that help stabilize it. You actually have to pull a little to get it off the counter. Great value for the amount I spent!
"When I received the box, I just knew it was way more than what I needed. My fault !A 9 cup food processor is way too much for myself and wife. The price is descent with a superior strength motor. It‚Äôs just too big for small jobs or cooking for 2 or 3. If your family is 4 or more or cook a great deal very often, get it."
"This is my first food processor and I bought it to make nut and seed butters. It has annihilated almonds, so I am pleased with it. I probably need to add oil to make a liquid butter.It‚Äôs a little loud, but not unbearable. It‚Äôs easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. It‚Äôs good for storing the finished product too.It works well on almonds and sprouted pumpkin seeds. I think it‚Äôll work well on walnuts too."
"This food processor saves so much time with slicing and chopping.  It has a strong motor and the size is perfect for my family.  I have been using the food processor for a month now and can't find one thing I don't like about it.  It's easy to use; easy to clean, and saves a lot of my time since I no longer have to chop, dice or slice ingredients.  It can be used for kneading dough, another time saver.  In short, I love this product!"
"Okay, I bought this model because the lower one didn‚Äôt have a function puree function. I saw others say the puree function didn‚Äôt work well but it does. Shredding cheese and carrots works well. It handles dough mixing very well. Others saying the grate/chop blade leaves pieces on top, it does but they‚Äôre negligible (couple little pieces). My only complaint is that the feed tube could be a little larger but no big deal. This thing is awesome and at a very reasonable price."
"excellent product , very powerful motor ,thick plastics"
