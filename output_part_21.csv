"These are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned.  I bought them for hiking on damp mornings and in wetlands.  They’re perfect for that - warm, dry and very stable.  But, after less than a week of owning them, I want to wear them everywhere all the time.  (So much so that just went ahead and ordered another pair of keens with a low top.)  It did take a me a few days to adjust to the higher top as I usually don’t wear a mid-top shoe - but needed one for hiking during foliage as it get slippery out there - but the insoles were perfect from day one.  Can’t say enough great things about the design - that wide toe box PLUS heel lock is real so you don’t feel like you’re sliding all around inside them or have to tighten the laces as far in as they go as happens in the some other zero-drop wide toe box shoes."
"These are comfortable, sturdy, light weight, & make my big feet look great. They run a tad small though so order half a size up."
"I bought these specifically to walk my dog on wet days but have found myself wearing them frequently.  As others have said the fit is great with an ample toe box. They also have enough wiggle room for either regular socks or thicker socks; either way they are comfortable and keep my ankles stable. From the first day I wore them, when we walked about 4 miles, I've had no discomfort whatsoever.  I may order another pair just to have when these ones wear out!"
"I have had them for a couple weeks and walked about 10 miles in them trying to break them in and get used to them.  1st issue: the toe box is actually not particularly wide. Coming from a pair of Altra hiking shoes, my feet definitely feel cramped. But I was also spoiled with that toe box, so I was willing to overlook that. It's definitely wider than a pair of Merrells. 2nd issue: The right boot has started making a crinkling sound, like the glue is dried out and bad.  3rd issue:  The left boot has a weird seam right above the pinky toe that is rough and creates blisters.  This is not in the right boot. The right boot feels awesome, just makes a weird sound.  For the money, I would have liked a sturdy pair of boots that didn't cause blisters.  I think Keen needs to tighten down their manufacturing. The fact that two boots in the same pair to have two very different problems, is concerning.I have a hiking trip coming up that I don't have time to break in a new pair for, So I'm going to wrap my foot, bring some extra glue, and my old Altras for backups. Fingers crossed these hold up in the New Hampshire white mountains.**UPDATE** I took these boots with me to climb Mt. Washington. I wore them as much as possible in the days leading up to the hike.  After about 15 miles of wear, they FINALLY were broken in.  It was like a switch flipped and they're super comfortable hiking boots now. The weird seam is no longer poking out, and the toe boxes loosened up. They served me quite well on Mt Washington. The soles were super grippy and worked well on wet and slushy rock. When we got into the compacted ice, i added Microspikes and the boots felt very stable with those on as well.  I've had hiking boots where spikes felt weird, but felt fine on these.  Updating to 4 stars, because I'm still not totally sure about the glue on the one boot. I took it to a bootery and they said it was fine, but without removing the sole they couldn't be 100% sure.I recommend these IF you have the time to break them in THOROUGHLY before your adventure."
"These boots stay clean even in wet grass, have comfortable support, and are high quality. They fit true to size and are easy to lace up in terms of functionality. Love them!"
"I had no breaking in period. Wore these right out of the box on long hikes in Iceland. Kept my feed dry through shallow streams, no slippage up or down hills. I usually have problems with my toes hitting the front of shoes when going down hill but these kept my foot in place so no issues there."
"I was recommended these hiking boots by my parents because I was heading to Costa Rica. I bought them back in April 24’. I used them multiple times for good lengths of time over several different terrains to break them in. I even wore them to Disneyland to walk ten miles in. Every time I wore them my feet felt like they would fall apart. So uncomfortable that I ended up purchasing inserts to put in them. Fast forward to June during my trip. I wore them on the hikes through the rain forest and let me tell you I did not feel confident in them keeping me stable one bit. I was constantly focused on where to step in fear of losing the grip. They were great to protect my feet and ankles from critters but that was it. Two days ago I was walking around the main city and had my hiking sandals on, walked 4 miles and felt great but it was starting to rain and the streets can get a little slick. I decided before heading out on a walking food tour to switch to the boots to help keep me from slipping. They did the OPPOSITE! I can’t count how many times I felt the shoe slip as I walked. Ultimately I ended up slipping and unable to save myself. I fell hard on my knee resulting in a giant slice and scrape. I couldn’t go back and change because the tour had started. So I’m walking through the city with bloody knee and walking for another 4 miles before finally making it back to the hotel and my feet were literally screaming. The tops of my feet were so strained, the bottoms hurt and I got a large blister on one of my toes (which I hadn’t gotten one yet). I would’ve felt safer in the hiking sandals and more confident in not slipping/falling. I one hundred percent wouldn’t purchase these again nor recommend them."
"I bought these to replace an old pair of Keen hikers that I absolutely loved, but they had served their time and were ready to be replaced.  I can't remember if they were Targhee's or not, but from what my husband and I can tell, these are the boots that were most similar to my last pair.I jumped on this pair because the price was awesome, compared to ordering directly from Keen!  They have the classic Keen wider toe box, which is perfect for my wide, size 8 feet.  I ordered an 8, and they fit perfectly.  I wore them for a day on my daughters field trip, and I can't really say that they needed to be broken in, they were just comfy and a perfect fit from the get-go.  I also wore these hiking this summer in Alberta and BC, and they were amazingly comfortable.  I highly recommend if you're looking for a hiking boot with a nice wide toe box and you don't want to have to break them in!"
"It was my first time to purchase KEEN hiking shoes, after I tried it in heavy trails , I love it ! I think I'll consider KEEN one of my favourite brand in hiking shoes."
"The shoes fit my size perfectly and are light, tough, and comfortable."
Bought these for hiking on trails in Arizona. Used them for 5 days in a row and they were fantastic! They were the most comfortable option in this price point and seemed like a great value for the money. Highly recommend!
"Sturdy boots and sufficient wide cut. Meant to take a beating. Ofc, it is a shoe for 60.-, dont expect it to be on the same level as a high end product.It is comfy and the sizing is true to the chart.I nor ally wear a 13 but buy a 14 bc of the thicker socks I wear. This shoe would have been enough in 13 tho…"
"As a mail carrier who walks 12 miles a day, I like these boots. Long lasting comfort and solid waterproofing"
Great shoes!  I wore them all around Alaska and they are very comfortable and warm.  I went up one size to allow for thicker socks and it worked like a charm.  I would buy these again!
Just received.. looks great and will post update as soon as they worn to see how they function.
"Looks great, feels great till you get water on them. I bought these for a BWCA trip and was expecting them to be waterproof. A bit of water already gets absorbed easily, thus resulting in wet toes, not exactly a plan for a multiple day camping trip with wet boots. Save your money and get an expensive pair. Do not recommend if you plan to be near water."
"time will tell, but for now they are very comfortable and my feet are dry after walking through park in heavy dew."
Very comfortable
"Love these mid top trainer/ boots , great support for my ankles  , so comfortable have worn my first pair out"
"They fit true to size, and seem durable. I haven't had a chance to put them through the ringer yet but have done lots of standing for hours in them and some walking. I have flat feet and they didn't hurt *too* bad after. Tread and grip seem to be pretty decent on uneven and loose terrain.The ankle support style they have going is odd, they grip your ankles pretty firmly. I'm assuming over time it kind of stretches or loosens, but for now it is a bit uncomfortable.Breathability seems ok. I'm in Arizona but got these just as the triple digit weather ended, but I haven't felt like my feet were swimming. However the goretex is obvious as my feet were noticeably warm.Tldr, grippy, kinda warm, ankle support is incredibly smug, objectively breathable, also kind of funny color combo"
"A little big on fit. Not bad thought at all if you wear warm winter socks! The Gore Tex waterproofing and insulator, are as always, on point. No water leaks in snow or creek. Feet stayed warm, but not hot or sweaty. Perfect. They are by far the lightest hiking boots I’ve ever worn, and comfortable is an understatement! Definitely have recommended Solomon brand to family and friends. Great boots, and not as expensive as other “top shelf” winter hiking boots!"
So far very comfortable and holding up to my expectations.  Time will tell if these boots can make the grade or not.
"I have not been impressed with Solomon boots recently (2023).  The quality has been suspect on almost every boot I've tried.  But with these, my faith has finally been somewhat restored.  These are by far the heaviest Salomon boot I've tried, but they are secure and comfortable after you break them in (but they do take a while to break in -- depending on how much hiking per week you do)."
"I gave these boots five stars in spite of my criticism for their durability, because I'm not sure if any other boot would last this long. For context, I do boxing exercise in the morning, am on my feet all day for my job, frequently run five miles at the park, and also exercise at night. I have been wearing only these shoes for all of these activities. They also get soaked with sweat so every morning and night I have to use a boot dryer. I initially started using hiking boots for all my exercise, including running, because my coach said it would help relieve my knee pain, which it did. Unfortunately I am beating the absolutely crap out of these shoes, and after writing all this down, realize that it's a miracle they survived this long! 😂Also you can see where I used waxed thread for sewing leather to repair where the shoes have started coming apart. Same on the other boot. Also, worth noting I had this happen on my previous pair of Salomon boots that I used when I was at the Postal Service where I walked around all day (but didn't run or do exercise in them). That pair lasted significantly longer but ended up tearing in the exact same spots. However, the soles of the current pair still have a lot of life in them which is why I've repaired them."
"I do some really rugged trekking and work in hilly bushy land. Sometimes wet, muddy and slippery ON CLAY! Yuck clay. Yuck 15lbs of mud on each boot. Slow, In the rain. Dark. Holding stuff, going nowhere fast. Yuck clay.Anyway, Quality top notch! My bush resilience is partly based on the toughness of this boot. I’m fairly remote and can’t take careless chances. Using heavy brush cutters and chainsaws on steep slopes for hours is serious work - it requires your full attention - the ankle support is absolutely essential. The trakky grip sole is essential. The added bonus of being lightweight is essential. I can’t say enough how much I value this piece of footwear. Sometimes I’m like a Sherpa, carrying anywhere between 30 and 70lbs on shoulder, up and down hills. I will never work without it - galoshes? Wellies, neoprene, rubber boots, whatever they’re called are for flat land, washing a car or something like that.These are the boots that can get you in and out of anything - with or without load. It’s a vital piece of survival/work gear. If I don’t have these to get into the action… nah, will just stay home! bought a second pair kinda for dry weather. The waterproof didn’t really hold up somehow by 3rd year of use. Dammit they’re good!"
"I work with water a lot. I work on pools. These boots have had yet to see the worst. And already gave up. There was some clear signs. Something was wrong. I continued my day and then it took a turn for the worst. At first, it felt like I had bubbles somewhere inside the shoe. I could feel them squirt and move around every time I took a step, but my foot was dry however, this was concerning. And then later, I was standing maybe one or 2 inches in a puddle working and my shoes filled with water. Water is not splashed on them. These have sustained no damage. I’ve had these three days of walking and working and they’re already useless."
I wanted a good hiking boot to look at on the floor by my door that I wont use enough  :P  These fit great and feel really good. Love the way they look as well.My only isue is one of the shoelaces is shorter than the other so its harder to tie that one.  Over all I love them.  I only gave a 4 on comfort as I havent broken them in fully yet and my feel do hurt after wearing them for a while.  Im thinking once I get used to them and they conform to my feet that should get better
"My boyfriend started a new job and needed designated shoes to be left at the greenhouse. He's very picky with his shoes, both in looks and comfortability. He decided to go with these based of good reviews, looks, and price point. They've held up well in the greenhouse environment. His feet stay dry. He talked about how comfortable they were, even on day one. They fit true to size. Definitely consider these if you work in a greenhouse!"
"Size is true to form , nice and waterproof , traction and grip is Very good is slick conditions."
"These are really nice hiking boots. I am a big fan of Adidas foot wear and have the low sneakers just like these and always buy last years' style, since these are generally at half price and the current ones are about 200 now, I am not cheap, but why pay that much for the same shoes, with slightly different styles. The treads are good for climbing up the slopes.We do lots of hiking in Sedona and Tucson, these have good traction and comfort for long hikes and the high tops provide more ankle support. I wear 11.5 and these were just a perfect fit at 11.5. Sometimes I end up buying 12's in Adidas shoes, but these fit just fine."
"Well made, soft and very comfortable!Price $20. More than they should be.Should have been priced at $59. Not $79.Time will tell if they hold up, nice boot for winter, climbing and hiking!"
"Love these shoes, live in Wisconsin and they are excellent for winter conditions. I really like the high ankle support for uneven terrain. Grip is excellent in frozen and slippery surfaces. Would recommend."
"Warm, comfortable and good looking.  They fit perfect."
"After reading all the reviews, a lot of people said to order up a size. I usually wear a 7 in men’s sneakers, so I ordered the 7.5. I wish I would have just ordered the 7, because these are a little big for me. I’m a little disappointed, because I like them, but they’re a little big and I don’t know if I can really return them now, or exchange them for the smaller size.They are well made, have good traction and a nice sole. They are a little difficult to get on and off, but that’s most likely because of the way that they are laced. Plus, I have to have them laced pretty tightly because they’re a little big for me.They are nice, though. Cool kicks. Not sure about waterproofness, but they are sturdy and comfortable."
"Comfortable, ideal for walk and stand for many hours. Quality materials and slip resistance."
"These boots are a literal LIFESAVER and can withstand ANYTHING.My little brother impulse invited me to go hike an active volcano in Guatemala 4 days before departure and these boots got me through that TWO-DAY, FIFTEEN HOUR HIKE - which was so steep, you’re basically walking horizontally, directly up for 14,000 METERS!! Where you also hike through the terrain and weather of FOUR DIFFERENT CLIMATES, beginning with blaring sun and ending above the clouds in brutal wind and freezing temperatures - all while trudging through nonstop mud, rock, sand, ash, rainfall, and gravel so loose you’re taking 2 steps up and sliding 1 step back!Bought these 2 days before we left. Wore them around while packing, etc. so never really broke them in but it didn’t matter. My feet stayed dry, warm, and comfortable literally the entire time, and I had ZERO blisters at the end of it. Not a mark! I may never walk again but that’s no fault of the boots!! They held up PERFECTLY! And matched all my outfits :)Some cute English guy in our group even asked if they were “designer” because he liked them (lol). Also, I’m shocked at the price, STILL. These should honestly be 5x more expensive for what you’re getting - and after all that, they still somehow look good.Telling you, these boots saved me. Can’t even imagine what that hike would have been like without them being everything they needed to be! I have no complaints. They are perfect. I love them. And you will too.me: got the beige ones with the brown/cream/blue heel accent in a size 6, true to size - these boots are ALL weather proof, for real.(the last pic is post-one week in Guatemala and that crazy hike .. I ended up wearing them like the whole time - so also rode 4Wheelers in them, while walking around town, airport, etc.! Still haven’t cleaned them even though they were completely covered in dirt and sand and mud after the hike ..but somehow don’t look that dirty lol)"
I got these for a trip and they were perfect. They are kind of hard to slide and the shoelaces are hard to pry apart to loosen. But once they’re on they are super comfortable. I love the flannel lining it’s really soft. I am flat footed so it’s more on the flat side and not much of an arch in the boot. I got an 8.5 which is what I usually wear and it works perfected. Plenty of toe space. I love the color options in got the light brown. The boots do make some noise from the running of the leather but it improves over time. Took a bit of time to break in. They are great boots for a great price!
"These shoes are super cute for hiking shoes! They’re soft on the inside, but not too hot to wear in the summer. They’re waterproof and durable. They even have some cushion in them for extra comfort! The laces are not too complicated. The sides rise up enough for ankle support. They are super light weight compared to other hiking boots. I usually wear between a 6-7, so I ordered a 6.5. They fit a bit snug, so I probably should have ordered a 7. But even snug they’re not super uncomfortable and should break in after wearing them a couple more times. Overall, these are a good value for the money spent."
"I like the way the boots look - very stylish and modern. I plan to wear them in light snow and to hike. They are very warm and comfortable and because they are waterproof, I will be able to wear them in different types of weather."
"I'm so happy with this purchase. They may run slightly big or ""roomy"" but I like that I am able to wear thick socks with them. The inner lining material is very sold. Sturdy soles with great traction on ice. At this price point, I highly recommend!"
Bought these boots for hiking. Put them on to try and Love it!!! Super comfy and very nice looking. A but squiky since I wore just for an hour. Aso warm and cosy. I think I will get another pair for hiking. These are perfect for fall/ winter I am in CA. Sprayed with water resistant  sprsy to keep clean and mud free.Highly recomended!
"Boots were fine and comfortable.  I have bigger fingers so I would like if the pull tab had a little wider finger hole.  And also after walking in them all day they did stain my white socks with some orange and gray marks, not all over but some."
"Bought these to work on hurricane recovery in NC. Brand new they were comfy, needed about a week for break-in and, yes - they SQUEAKED (pic 1). A little baby powder under the laces on top of the tongue fixed the squeak. The boots went through a lot of muck, serious terrain, rain & snow for 5 solid days (pic 2), but a little stiff bristle brush & they came out great (pic 3, color chg due to different lighting). My feet were always warm, dry & comfy, and I never slipped regardless of the conditions. I bought these because of the rating and at this price wasn't a loss if they didn't survive. Now, I plan to buy another pair when these wear out."
Well finishing good quality
"These fit well and as expected as far as size goes.I like the skecher brand. What has been challenging with these shoes is the grommets haven't been the best.The same pair of shoes right and left, looking down, top left through grommet pulled loose (3rd down, left side). I found some great glue and along with a clamp and a couple of tries, I've been able to keep using these shoes. I ordered a 2nd pair and have used this pair only while letting the glue cure. So far, so good. You can also see the 2nd pic shows a different shoe string. It happens.I wear these shoes every day. I usually go through shoes, so 8 months, even with repairs, is ok.I hope they get the grommets sorted.As far as the seams, no gaps or tears which is surprising given the grommet issue. Very pleased with this part of the build.Wear pattern has been. Looks even after 8 months, your wear may vary. But quite a bit of rubber left and even.The metal ""waterproof"" badge is silly. Broke off the left fairly early, the right is still hanging on by one.As far as waterproof goes, I guess they are fine, I have not paid attention to this piece as I didn't buy them to be water proof. But if the grommets are going to come off, make your own assumptions.They are comfortable and stay relatively cool while moving around. Sitting still will warm up as expected.I may actually make it a whole year with these shoes with a little more grommet glue which will honestly be the first time in 35 years.I've built a kitchen pantry, removed windows, installed a patio door in our house. I have also made a rental property ready to re-rent... A lot more effort and quicker. I have done oil changes and added a lift to my truck and much more. These shoes have been through a lot of torment and have held up, with just a little glue to help."
"I recently purchased the Skechers Men's Relment-Pelmo Hiking Boots for my son-in-law, and I must say these boots have proven themselves to be a reliable and resilient choice for outdoor adventures. Specifically designed for hiking and light rock climbing, they showcased their exceptional performance during a challenging trek.Right from the start, it was evident that these boots were built to endure demanding terrains. The sturdy construction and durable materials instilled confidence that they would withstand the rugged conditions encountered during the hike. My son-in-law took on 15 miles of trails and conquered numerous rough rock faces, and these boots held up admirably, demonstrating their impressive durability.Comfort is paramount during long hikes, and the Skechers Relment-Pelmo Hiking Boots excelled in this aspect. They remained consistently comfortable throughout the entire hike, ensuring that my son-in-law's feet stayed cozy and supported. The boots' design incorporates features that cushion the foot and provide ample arch support, contributing to a fatigue-free hiking experience.It's worth noting that my son-in-law took the precaution of wearing these boots daily for a week before the hike to break them in. This step allowed him to acclimate to the boots and ensure a comfortable fit. However, the boots' performance during the actual hike was exceptional, and their durability and comfort were evident even without an extended break-in period.The Skechers Relment-Pelmo Hiking Boots offer exceptional value for their quality. Their performance, combined with their reasonable price, makes them an excellent investment for outdoor enthusiasts. Knowing that these boots held up impressively during a demanding hike gives us confidence that they will continue to deliver in future adventures.In summary, the Skechers Men's Relment-Pelmo Hiking Boots surpassed our expectations, proving to be a reliable and resilient companion during an arduous trek. Their durability, comfort, and ability to withstand rough terrains make them a smart choice for outdoor enthusiasts. Once my son-in-law wears out his current pair, we will undoubtedly be returning to Skechers for another remarkable hiking boot experience."
"I ordered a 10 Wide but received a 10 Extra Wide. I was going to return them but after a little thinking I decided to keep them and give them a whirl. I have a tendency to blow out the little toe area on the right shoe thus the wide order. But, not with every brand or shoe, I still sometimes wear out the little toe area even with a wide so I decided to keep these Extra Wides. I added a cheap pair of cushioning insoles and since winter is coming upon us I figured with heavier socks and the insoles that these just might work out alright. I have only had them for about 3 weeks now and did a grueling hike up and down ravines for about 3 hours and have worn them casually a couple of other times, 4-5 hours at a time. My initial thoughts right now is that these will work. They are very comfortable and lighter than a coupe of other pairs of hiking boots that I own. On my first hike I did end up walking through about ankle deep of water that was in a creek and as advertised, they kept my feet dry. How long the waterproofing will last is still yet to be determined because every other waterproof boot I have owned lost its ability to keep my feet dry after a couple years. I didn't want to just jump in and give them 5 stars yet since I have only had them a few weeks but will try and update this review after this hunting/hiking season comes to an end early January. I should have worn them enough by then to give an honest updated review."
They fit great and are very comfortable to wear.  I'm on my feet 12+ hrs a day and walking alot and they feel great
"My feet were designed for Skechers shoes. Have bought many pairs and all were comfortable and long wearing. Will continue to buy..  Being water prof is a positive feature, and they look good."
"These shoes were so useful I wore out a pair and bought them again years later.  The uppers are tough enough to protect my feet during nature walks.  They look great.  The fit is comfortable, with a wide-enough toe box."
These are some really nice boots and really comfortableThank you for a quality pair of bootsüëç
"I'm not kidding, the boots are so very comfortable, they feel like slippers. They are new so a complete review is hard to do at this point, but I may come later if they disappoint.  But at the moment, I highly recommend them.  The size is true, the bottom grip seems quite adequate, very please with this purchase!"
"Great price, very light and comfortable."
"I really hate buying shoes because I am 100% about comfort and functionality.Straight out of the box, I considered returning them because they just felt light and a little too roomy. But I ended up putting these on for the first cold day in Colorado. They were cute with leggings. So even if I couldn‚Äôt hike in them, I figured they would do for running around town. The plan was to go to a museum downtown, but somehow I ended up on a 4 plus hour hike in the pouring rain at 46 degrees F.These little boots were amazing! Comfortable for hiking that involved serious elevation changes. No issue with the toe box. IYKYK. I sloshed up past 11,000 feet elevation on a trail that became a small river. And then sloshed down in the same conditions. They were so comfortable. They had good grip in slick mud and on slippery rocks. My feet stayed warm and dry over creek passing.I am in shock at the price of these. They are so much better than my Moab‚Äôs. The terrain didn‚Äôt phase them. They were so much more durable than I first thought.I‚Äôm super happy with them."
I wear a size 6.5 and bought the black pair and the  brown pair. This review is for the black pair.  First impressions were that they sent me the dark brown I even asked my husband what color they were and he said dark brown. Although the coloring is off I still feel in love with these boots.The fit couldn‚Äôt have been better. Great ankle support and cushioning with arch support on insoles. The fur was the icing on the cake.I couldn‚Äôt wait to wear them so instead of shorts I threw on jeans and the boots in Texas in 90 degree heat and took my dog for a walk.  My feet never hurt nor did they sweat. It was better than wearing my asics or vans or Nike the arch support kept me walking as if I had a pair of my tennis shoes on.A neighbor asked where I got them and I referred them hereWaterproof I can‚Äôt fully attest to as it did sprinkle but not enough to leave puddles although the tops didn‚Äôt have spots left on them from where the droplets did hit them. So that was a relief. I‚Äôm going to scotchgaurd them just to be safe.I was walking on dirt and through woods a bit but what dirt sand leaves twigs I ran into was easily brushed off and no scratches or tears.The boots were stiff for first part of walk but soon loosened to a comfortable fit still providing the additional ankle support and cushioned insole.I will be buying the pink ones next hey a women can‚Äôt have to many hiking boots! Especially ones that are functional and fashionable.
"I love the feel of them with the support for your feet. The little fuzzy adds some cuteness and I love that they are durable for winter and definitely worth the price. I wear them to work, I wear them just going out. So they‚Äôre great to wear anytime! üëç I highly recommend these if you want durability AND support. üëç"
"These are very comfortable and keep your feet very warm. I haven't used them in snow as of yet,  but so far they have been very durable. They are true to size."
"I‚Äôm not a huge boot person. BUT I do own three pairs of boots, Muk boots, Timbs, and now this pair. I got them yesterday- fast shipping- arrived right on my birthday :) The value for product is unmatched. They are comfortable and fluffy on the inside. I live in the Midwest and got these for when I shovel snow to keep my toes warm. Luckily it has not snowed yet here, but based on the reviews I read, they will be nice for the cold weather. Plus they are cute! Win win!"
"They fit like a dream, are unbelievably comfortable and the quality it top notch. I am absolutely thrilled."
"These boots far exceeded my expectations!!! They are not only beautiful, but they're super warm and comfy!!! I live in a very cold area and need water resistant, comfort, beauty, and warmth!!! Check, check,check, and check!!! Thrilled with the product!!!"
"I had high hopes for these boots, wore them for half an Ohio winter season and they couldn't stand the test of time. Now mind you I was not using them even as actual hiking snow boots, I simply wore them as cutesy boots with jeans maybe 8 or so times. While they are very attractive boots and were originally comfortable, the heel/Achilles area wore down pretty quickly and started to rub badly in that area even with decently thick socks, also the bottoms (inside the boot) would somehow get wet after about the 4th wear. Not like I was splashing around in puddles or anything, just simply walking through snow or in some minor slush areas. Not sure if I just got a poorly made set or what. But they were not all I expected them to be sadly."
"These boots are comfy, warm &ever so light on your feet.Bought them as it's getting so cold & wet lately, they keep my feet very cosy."
Very comfy and true to size
I wanted some boots for dog walking. I didn't want to spend too much as they were likely to get covered in mud. I was sceptical about the price and whether they would be comfortable enough. They are perfect. We'll worth the money!
"I've enjoyed these boots several times already and I just bought them! They're very cute and comfortable. Kind of sporty looking which is what I wanted. I bought a 6.5 to make room for my thick socks, but I think a 6 would have been a better choice. They are slightly too big... not enough to exchange because my thick socks vary enough that I can choose my thickest ones and still be comfortable.Note it states ""hiking STYLE"" boots. These are not hiking boots. Don't mistake them for hiking boots, they won't hike well. There's no grip on the sole. They do LOOK like hiking boots though, so if it's the look you want, here it is."
"First of all they have wide widths.  I am grateful for that.  I like to wear a thicker sock in the winter and my feet are a bit wider than normal folks.  It's a little work to get them on, but they are comfortable.  No breaking in period, I wore mine all day without them hurting my feet at all.  What I don't understand is why all of the colors are not the same price? I looked a week ago and the grey ones were $79 and then looked recently they were the same as the other colors at $44.  I ordered right away before the price jumped again.  I would order 1/2 size larger than your normal.  All in all cute boots, very comfortable, reasonably priced."
"ETA- they were so uncomfortable getting on and off I ended up donating them. Disappointed.Cute pair of boots, I chose the lighter color which I think goes nicely with many outfits. So far they seem like better quality than a different pair I recently bought from a discount store for the same price range. You could dress these up or down which is nice. Comfort is good, and they kept my feet pretty warm. Only thing I donâ€™t like, is that itâ€™s a bit hard getting them on/off because of the high top ankle."
"These booties are so nice. They are a great quality. Look good with jeans, or long skirts and dresses.  The material is  so nice. The price is great. I got a 8 w because I need ankle support as well as room for my toes. They give me this. I recommend these."
"I needed to get a wide width due to edema which hopefully will improve soon. But, none of my regular shoes would get over my swollen feet. These were my exact size. I am a 9 1/2  regular width so I increased the width to get shoes on and these worked like magic. And they look cute too. I did not have to go up a size like other reviewers said nor did I have to wear bulky socks. This is day one, and I hope they stay this comfortable."
"Love then, stile is cute. I think they run small though alby a bit so if yiu wear wide like a do. Might need to size up. Feel in the middle between roomy and snug, so might need to return and size up for socks, haven't tested it yet. Hard to pull off once they are tight. And are a bit small in back towards the heel"
