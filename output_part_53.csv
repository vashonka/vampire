"Very robustly built and gets pretty loud. Though I wish it did get a little louder, and the bass is pretty muddy"
"I was having problems synching my old Amazon Tap, so I replaced it with this Sony speaker.Bluetooth synch was instantaneous and the sound quality and volume range are excellent.I use it while in the shower, and it comes with a wrist strap that you can use to easily affix it to a towel bar or whatever.  This is an EXCELLENT product."
"I have had a few months time enough to evaluate this speaker or should I say speakers; I purchased two of them for the ability to have stereo. I got them to replace my failed JBL Flip 5 Waterproof speaker. I could have just purchased the latest JBL Flip 6 but decided to try the Sony‚Äôs instead. In comparison I would say the bass and battery life were better on the JBL 5. But the Sony‚Äôs have grown on me. They do have great sound and good bass as well as hearing beautiful separated stereo. The battery life is about 6 hours and not 12 has they claim. Although they do charge up very quickly. Setting up bluetooth connections was tricky making them sync for stereo. An easier way to connect is using the free Sony App ‚ÄúMusic Center‚Äù which connects them with ease. Once connected, they can be used with any other App on your phone. One troubling thing was carrying them as a pair. There is no linkage to hold them together and there is no Sony case designed to hold them as a pair. After full research on this I found that the dimensions of the JBL 5 resembled a similar shape and size as a pair. I purchased one of the ‚ÄúLebakort Hard Case Compatible with JBL Flip 5‚Äù (slender but longer for accessories with a carrying handle) and also bought a Hermitshell Hard Travel Case Fits JBL Flip 5‚Äù (shorter but fatter for accessories with a secure loop and Carabiner). Both cases are a perfect, comfortable fit including the charging cables. I highly recommend these little speakers as a Stereo pair combined with a storage case. Love them very much and I‚Äôm sure you will too."
"TLDR: It's a fantastic little speaker for the price! Perfect if your laptop or phone speaker just isn't cutting it.Long Version:I needed something for listening to music or watching youtube videos as I'm cooking or cleaning. My phone and laptop just can barely keep up as I move around cooking or cleaning a few feet away. This speaker is great for filling the house with volume!While I try not to push speakers and amps much past 50% volume, to avoid overwhelming or over heating them. The volume of the Sony XB13 remains gentle and quiet until you get to 50% volume. Then it scales up rapidly just like you see in the Rting review. At first, I thought it was extremely quiet compared to the JBL Go 3.It was only after writing my first review, I decided to investigate the Rting's spec sheets. I couldn't understand that the Sony was within 1 DB of peak loudness with the Go 3 when it felt a quarter as loud. After pushing it to pushing it to 70-80% volume, I discovered that the loudness scales up exponentially to it's peak. It filled the entire house with sound at 70%, just as I had hoped for.This design of exponentially increasing volume is actually brilliant, because you can finely set the volume when you need it to be quiet. Then you can still get it loud and clear when you need it as well! Quite brilliant in my opinion. It really took me a while to appreciate this thing, now I love it!It's a fantastic little speaker if you can get one on sale for around $40! Almost unbeatable in this price range when you consider the price of buying speakers with an amp."
"Sound boost for watching movies, etc. on the phone is only OK. I have the sound all the way up, but it's still not quite loud enough to hear if some other noise occurs or when stepping into the next room. Not worth the cost."
"I've had one of these for a while, and nobody can believe such big sound comes from this little speaker. As an audio nerd I was intrigued by the stereo pair feature, so when Amazon had it on sale I bought another one. It's night and day. Good sound in mono becomes great sound in stereo. Unfortunately the barely-there instructions aren't very clear about how to set up the stereo pair - I wasn't sure if you needed to pair both speakers to your sound source, or just one. The answer is, just one. The second speaker pairs to the first speaker. So far, the speakers ""remember"" that they're paired, so when I turn them on, they are still paired. They let you know it, too: a voice comes out of one and says ""left"" and then you hear ""right"" from the other one. If you have one of these speakers already, buy a second one, you'll be glad you did."
"I have owned quite a few speakers in my time, from small to large, wireless and powered. This one stands out for its richness in volume, loud enough for an outdoor environment and small enough to carry anywhere. Connection to my Samsung phone no issues, no loss in connection, smooth play. Good speaker for the money."
"Small, tastefully designed, easily removable strap so I can have it on my desk. I was hesitant about black, but it looks sharp and good quality. Sound quality is great. Overall super happy! I tried some obscure brands before getting this one but they had issues with bluetooth connectivity, and frankly looked not that great, finally decided to go back to sony, I‚Äôm happy I did. Quality is quality!"
"Love the size good wee sound u can take it out the backdoor and holiday, üòç"
"The JBL Boombox 2 has truly impressed me in every way! Right out of the box, it was so easy to set up and start using‚ÄîBluetooth pairing is a breeze, and the controls are intuitive. Whether I‚Äôm indoors or outdoors, this speaker delivers incredible sound quality. It fills the house with deep bass and crisp highs, making everything from music to podcasts sound amazing.Durability is where this speaker really shines. I‚Äôve strapped it to the back of my quad for rides, and it‚Äôs even taken a few falls with no issues at all‚Äîit still works perfectly! It‚Äôs built like a tank, yet it still looks sleek and modern. I love the design; it‚Äôs bold and stylish, so it fits in anywhere, whether in my living room or out in the yard.As for power, this thing is a beast. The sound doesn‚Äôt just fill a room‚Äîit dominates it. Outdoors, the sound can be a little softer in wide-open spaces, but it still packs a punch and bumps hard. The battery life is fantastic, giving me hours of non-stop playtime without needing to charge. It‚Äôs my go-to for any outdoor activity or gathering.In short, the JBL Boombox 2 is incredibly easy to use, sounds amazing, and is tough enough to handle anything I throw at it. It looks great, sounds even better, and keeps going strong no matter where I take it. Highly recommend!This version emphasizes ease of use, sound quality, durability, power, and appearance, giving the review a well-rounded feel."
"This speaker is a MUST for audiophiles.The high, mid and bass are perfectly balanced for premium sound.  The battery life is great.  The carrying handle mashed it nice to take anywhere.  It looks sharp and sleek.  I've spent a lot of time listening to music and this is the best speaker I've ever heard"
"Absolutely love this speaker. Quality sound, easy to use, and long battery life. Music is my world and this speaker makes it so much better! I would not hesitate to recommend it üòä"
I never expect the size that way. So big. My 3rd time ordering on this JBL bluetooth speaker. Easy connect from the device to the speaker. Fabulous sound quality. Thank you for this!
I purchased this a while back and forgot to review but the wife loves it and still uses it. She‚Äôs taken it to the beach and it lasted for hours on one single charge. Haven‚Äôt test the waterproof claim but I‚Äôm sure it is since my buddy has one before me and he said it fell in his pool no issues. The sound it great and can get pretty loud.
"Awesome sound and deep bass, value for money"
"We got lucky with the price for this amazing JBL boombox aswome quality in every way sound everything it is just amazing, easy to conect, long battery life.  100 of 100 for this product"
"When I first took it out the box I tried to connect and use the speaker but it was cutting in and out and the bluetooth range was almost nonexistent. I looked online and followed the 10 step guideline listed on the job website and now everything is working perfectly! I will update if anything changes!Review:This thing might be big but it‚Äôs only because it packs a huge punch. It has clear, booming audio while still being light enough to carry. The design makes it super portable without sacrificing looks. It charges a bit slow but it also has a great battery life so it‚Äôs a trade off!Overall 9/10!"
"I purchased two of these to link. Frankly, I advise just purchasing one because the sound on one is better than the split equalized sound on the pair. Love this speaker."
Great speaker plays nice and clear and loud

I was waiting for it to go on sale so I can buy it and there was a previous deal at $58 but I didn't bite and knew it'd go much lower on black Friday Month and I was correct. I snagged this little glowing gem at $49. Such a great deal. I bought it because I walk in the daytime and I like listening to music but my phone wasn't loud enough so I thought of buying a small compact but loud with great sounding speaker and I've found it. It's loud has great sound, very sturdy and durable. Works great so far. Design is awesome. I can put it in my pocket and doesn't bother me. The clip itself is very durable and such a convenient thing to have. It also has an app to customize to customize the sound! I'm just so happy with it so far. Those were all of my PROS for it.The only con this thing has is the battery life. It says 12 hrs of battery life but it only lasts about 5hrs and that's probably because I always listen to my music on Max volume which would make sense. But the battery life doesn't bother me because I only use it for about an hour and then charge it once I'm finished listening to my music. I doubt people would listen to music for about 5hrs anyway so it shouldn't bother you. Great buy, make sure to buy it when it goes on sale. I am not a fake review, not whatever. To prove to you that I am not fake, my favorite anime is One Piece and Go watch DanDaDan Rn it is PEAK. DanDaDan is slowly becoming my favorite anime already Ô£ø√º¬ß¬£"
"Great little speaker for a reasonable price. Love the ease of use, small size, clip/ handle so I can attach it to a bag, and sound. It is cute! Long lasting power as well. Nice selection of different colors to choose from. Recommended!"
"This is a great portable Bluetooth speaker.  It produces great sound with no distortion, even at high volume levels.  The battery lasts throughout my eight-hour shift with no noticeable loss of power.  In addition to great sound the clip defines a new level of convenience allowing me to clip it to my belt where it is safe and always travels with me. I appreciate the large, easy to use on/off and volume controls.  One thing to note is that this is a monaural speaker and lacks the spatial quality of stereo sound.  I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t really notice because I use it at work where it is noisy but it is noticeable when played in a quiet environment."
"My daughter loves this speaker, she clips in on her bike handles for music during long family bike rides, her sports bags to bring music to warm-ups and other places. Great sound, perfect size. The color is pretty and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s easy to sync with phones. Works well! Nice quality speaker and parts. Worth the price!"
"Not as heavy as expected, easy setup,  and incredible sound quality including options for 3 types of sound styles.  Long battery life and fast charging.  Great buy!"
"In my opinion, this speaker is one of the best bangs for your buck. It's very loud for its size, the battery  lasts a while, and it can just clip anywhere.I use mine in the shower, it's literally perfect for that.  I don't even care about the lack of an aux port because this speaker is so small and portable.I got an Xtreme 3, and it sounds so much better than the clip 5, however it is far far less portable (also the speakers just have different features)I'm gonna leave you with a little caveat: It's a mono speaker most of your music is actually going to sound worse. It'll still sound ""good"", but it can sound better if you think about adding a second one for stereo sound, or just jumping all the way from the clip to the Xtreme series, because the clip through the charge are all mono speakers. the Xtreme is a stereo speaker.Just be noted, if those are features that matter."
"I love the aesthetics, the form factor, the size, the color, the volume and last but not least the clip. With being said I was less than enamored with the most important feature of this speaker which is the sound. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a smidge too bright and shrill for my taste. Luckily though there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s custom eq in the JBL app. So not only was I able to tame the sounds I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t like but I was also able to eq more of the sound I do like which is warmth. Now the sound is smidge better than adequate, and that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s all I can hope for. Keep in mind though that when you go above 60 percent volume the bass starts to decrease, and at 80 and above it virtually disappears. Luckily 60/70 is loud enough for me and that I normally play it in its sweet spot which is 40 percent.Do recommend this speaker? Yes. Just have realistic expectations. Which kinda seems like a big ask these days lol"
"The JBL Clip 5 is a fantastic find! I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. The sound is impressively clear and powerful for such a compact size. The built-in carabiner clip is super convenient for taking it anywhere. The build quality is excellent‚Äö√Ñ√Æit feels durable and well-made."
Sound is good for its size
"I purchased this speaker because it touts multiple features that I really like and was at a price point that is significantly lower than the ""big brands.""  This is a capable speaker that is relatively easy to pair to your Bluetooth device (phone, tablet, etc).  It's not too heavy, is quite water resistant and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy a party or family outing on the deck.  At just under $40, the sound quality (overall) is difficult to beat.  The bass is pretty deep and rich, the higher frequency sounds are very clear and not hindered by the closed-mesh grill that aids in making it waterproof.  I like that it's USB-C charging enabled and the SD-card slot is great for when you are out of ""cell range"" and just want to play music.Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks that could be addressed in the next revision.1 - The volume is directly tied to your Bluetooth device.  There seems to be almost NO amplification offered.  I am very hard of hearing and even at max volume (or when I'm in the pool and this is on the deck), from greater than 8 feet away, the speaker leaves MUCH to be desired in volume.  When I'm enjoying an evening on the deck or in the pool, I want my music to enhance the activities.2 - The buttons on the top are for ""play, power, mode, and volume adjustment"".  For a remote speaker that is designed to keep one from having to handle (even in wet conditions) their mobile device, I would expect to have buttons to switch to the next song or even go back one selection (or more).  If that feature is there, then I haven't discovered it.3 - The protective ""door"" on the charging port/PC port/SD card slot leaves much to be desired.  It's rubberized to help with the waterproofing, but the actual size/diameter of the rubber extension from  the cover to the speaker is so small, I imagine that after a few uses in the hot summer sun, it will become brittle and break.  Full disclosure, I haven't experienced that with this speaker (it's still new), but I have with others.  We boat a lot in the summer, so this could become a problem in the near future.Overall, I am happy with my purchase and hope to enjoy it for a long time to come.  My biggest complaint of all the items above is the volume.  The speaker is simply TOO QUIET!  In your bedroom, office or library it will be ""ok"".  Unfortunately, if you go outside (on a boat, pool deck, back porch) or anywhere with a high ceiling, you won't be ‚ÄúWaking up the neighbors‚Äù.  The MFG says the battery life is up to 24hrs, based on how high you have the volume, with 6 hours of playtime at max volume.  I have been fortunate to exceed that and would, therefore be willing to give up a couple hours (or connect it to a power pack) if it meant I could take it on the boat and be able to hear it blasting out those summer sounds."

This review is for the Vanzon V40 Bluetooth speaker. I included a video that shows the version of Vanzon speaker I'm reviewing because most of the reviews I am seeing are for a different version that looks rectangular not triangular in shape. Besides being different in shape, this speaker has lights on the 2 ends that cycle through different colors at 2 different speeds or can be turned off if desired. I am unsure why there are 2 different speakers on this review site. I'm guessing that this triangular V40 is a newer version? I actually also have the rectangular model which I like and still use but I think the triangular V40 has a better and more modern style and also  has slightly better sound quality.This speaker has great sound quality for a small speaker. The high tones are clear and the bass was surprisingly good. It connected quickly via Bluetooth to my phone and I can listen to my music and phone calls with the speaker. I really like the waterproof feature because I listen to music in the shower and the speaker is not damaged when it gets wet.The speaker has a long battery life which the manual says is 20 hours. The speaker automatically shuts off after 20 minutes if you are no longer playing music. This is a nice feature because it helps conserve battery life in case you forget to turn it off.  The speaker recharges rapidly using a USB-C type cable.  One comes with the speaker in case you don't have one. A 3.5 mm audio jack cable is also included if you want to connect the speaker with a wired non-Bluetooth device.This is an amazingly good Bluetooth speaker especially at its very reasonable price. I highly recommend it!"
"Wanted a second speaker to listen to audiobooks while sewing in an upstairs room. The Vanzon set-up is pretty easy, it discovers bluetooth devices with just a short delay, then emits a tone so you know it's connected. I can set up my audio book in the kitchen and carry the speaker upstairs and it doesn't disconnect or get distorted. Nice size. Good sound quality without distortion at the loudest setting. Seems to stay charged pretty well, although drains faster if using bluetooth at a distance for a long time. It was priced competitively compared to other similar speakers. It can be linked to another speaker but I haven't tried this. Comes with a type-C charging cable.Negatives: Not as loud as my old speaker, so it does not work well with my loud sewing machine unless I have it positioned right next to me. There is no visual display of the mode in which it is operating. the charging is included, but is a type c. As I have all android devices, not apple, this is the only type c device I own so when it needs to be charged I have to figure out where I left the cable or just keep it connected to the speaker at all times."
"These are fun little speakers that you can take anywhere without worry. They are waterproof so theres no fear taking it to the pool or the beach. The RGB lights are a nice touch, it adds a nice atmosphere to the room when music is playing. The speakers claim 20 hour batter and contains 24W bass. There are physical buttons on the speaker that can be used to control the music. I am enjoying it so far."
"It‚Äôs portable, and the battery is last long times. It won‚Äôt take too long for charging. That‚Äôs most that I like. They have very nice volume. Easy to operate and connect easily  with my iPhone. I pick pink color which is my fav color and I love the pink, very beautiful!"
"Very good sound for the size of the speaker. Offers better indoor sound, but also good for outdoors. Bought it because of its waterproof capabilities, but I don‚Äôt want to test that for now. :-)!will be buying a second one to test the wireless pairing with additional speakers."
Just got it while I was working out and swapped my old speaker with this one.  Works great. Sound quality is good.
I have at the speaker for about 18 months. Sound is good but only getting about four hours of use per charge.
Thank you quick delivery great product
Nice speakers. This thing is loud. Great to take with you to the beach. Easily connects to your devices too.
Nice speaker. Has good sound clarity..
This bluetooth speaker is compact and has good sound quality. It is also waterproof. I am going to use it to go to the beach in the summer and not have to worry about sand/water. It also has an SD card slot and takes up to 64 GB cards. It says that you can connect two of these to make a better stereo experience. I might have to get another one and try that out. Battery life is good. I have had it playing for 8 hours a day for the past few days and it hasn't had to be charged yet. The only downside is the LED flashing lighting mode isn't maintained after you power it off. You have to change the LED setting each time you power it on. Not a major issue though.
"I bought this speaker as a travel speaker. I'm more than happy with it's performance.  The battery life is great, lasts a long time. The volume and sound quality is very good.  Lastly, it travels well..Fits easily in my fully packed backpack. Most importantly it pairs easily"
"I purchased this little Bluetooth speaker to connect to my Peloton bike, which has very poor internal speakers. It does the job really well. It would be perfect if it had an auto-shutoff feature, as I sometimes forget to turn it off when my workout is done, and the battery runs down in the ensuing hours (sometimes issuing a low power beep that wakes me up at night). Overall a really nice product for the money."
"5 stars for the time being.  Good sound, low price, good for music in the barn.  No need for radio reception, no need for wall power.  It's plenty loud.  A 32G SD card will hold more songs or audio books, etc.) than you need.  Unfortunately the instructions are unclear and incomplete.  Here is how to play from an SD card.First, the card has to be populated outside the speaker.  The card is not recognized as a device when in the speaker using a USB cable to the computer.Start with the speaker off.Insert a micro SD card with your songs in mp3 or wav format on it.  The manual says it will take up to a 64GB card.  I used a 32GB.Turn the speaker on by pressing the on/off button slightly more than 2 seconds and release.Wait till LED is steady, and you hear one sound and then shortly another sound.Press ""play"" button for 2 seconds and release.Now press ""on/off"" button and release. (This is the trick)Music should start playing.Use ""play"" button to pause or start play""+"" does both volume up and skip track forward.  Press/ release to increase volume.  Hold ""+"" long until it skips to  and starts playing the next file.""-"" does both volume down and skip track back.  Press/ release to increase volume.  Hold ""-"" long until it skips to and starts playing previous file.The speaker will play continuously, rolling back to the beginning and starting over, until you stop it.This works better than a radio for me, with the bonus of no commercials, and only what I want to hear."
"Love this lil speaker! I take it to the river with me, practically, every weekend. It's small, which is convenient to put in my backpack. The battery life lasts FOREVER! I have been at the river for 6 hours and the speaker lasted the entire time. And the volume is decent. That is the only thing, i feel, could be improved. But for the price, you can't beat it. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for something compact, easily portable, lasts for hours and has a decent volume level."
"I work in a dirty, dusty environment so, my good speakers are not coming to work!!! I usually had another brand that was my ""go to"" work speaker & I would get about 1.5 years out of each one...that's operating 50-60 hours a week in a hot, dirty, dusty fiberglass composites shop, being exposed to misuse & abuse such as blowing it out with 120psi compressed air, and occasional drops & bangs that I do not recommend others expose their purchases to!!! Truthfully, it's absolutely cruel & unusual punishment for a speaker, so getting 1.5 years out of a ""cheap"" speaker is great!!In all honesty, my shop speaker usually lives the life of a destructive test subject!!!Now on to this speaker...Great sound, actually better than the other brand I used to use!!! It connects easily & I'm sorry I can't rate the battery life, but it's almost always plugged in during use...pretty sure the longest I've ever used it unplugged would be 2-3 hours, so have never ran it to that limit. Sounds great & is audible over several industrial machines in the immediate vicinity, I don't expect ""audiophile, symphony quality"" audio from this unit...and, honestly if you do, you're probably one of the reasons the desiccant bags in shoe boxes say ""Do not eat"". But...it has taken all of my abhorrent abuses in stride & come out grinning...at least for the first month. I will definitely update this review when/if the speaker finally succumbs to the reaper!!! But for this first review, I am very pleased with the unit & believe it's going to last at least as long as my other ones were & at a lower price point!!!"
"Didn't work with with my Guitar! Lol! Worked with smart phone and with a voice recorder. Good bluetooth range. Decent volume, size and quality!"
"This is the third one i bought in a row, the first one I lost at the beach, I loved the product so much i bought it again, my mom liked it a lot so I give her my second one and I bought a third one for myself. It lasts really long and it is really loud for the size. I use it in the shower all the time and it hasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t caused any problems for all the three speakers I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve bought. It charges pretty fast, but I wish the battery was longer. It only needs charging like once a week if you really use it."
Don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t pass on this little gem because of its ridiculous low price !  Sound quality is very good (surprising bass) and you can crank it up !! Connects quickly every time to my phone.  You will be surprised at the sound quality!
"I am giving this sound bar 5 stars, but with reservations. It is compact and not overly large. It fits on my mantle under the mounted tv. This is the second sound bar sent to me. The first one only worked a few days before I had to call Sony and troubleshoot it to find out it was defective. The price was good, however I had to pay UPS to return it to Amazon. I was told I would recoup the loss but as of yesterday that credit had not shown up in my account. First: pros- sleek, lightweight, good sound, good pricing, several ways to connect, seamless hookup with remotes, TVs, streaming devices, good sound. - Cons: I turn my tv off at night and then when I want to watch again, the sound bar won‚Äôt work. I am forever having to unplug the bar, tv, and fire stick to have any audio. This does not make sense. There is notations of the bar going into mute when you turn the device off, and it depending on what configuration you start up again, ie: tv first, sound bar first, streaming device, etc., it can go into mute mode. This is ridiculous. You want, or at least I do, one remote for everything so you don‚Äôt have to keep up with remotes for each device. I have a Sharp, interactive smart tv, and use a fire stick for my ‚Äúcable‚Äù. I have no choice as I use the ‚Äúgig‚Äù internet and that provider for my cable channels. My provider encourages you to use your own devices to receive the channels they offer so for us it‚Äôs the fire stick for cable and streaming. This should not be the problem with the bar not connecting and/or going into mute mode because of you turning your tv on. Since the description of this sound bar uses the seamless hookup as one of the advantages of purchasing this product, the manufacturer should design it to come on and work, regardless of what sequence your remote turns all the devices on. Amazon replaced the first unit (had it about two weeks, one using it, one trying to figure out what was wrong). Sony was good at troubleshooting but was no help at replacing the unit, even with me supplying the invoice, etc. After the troubleshooting, and me providing the invoice by email, I never heard from Sony again, so any compliment I give for customer service is to Amazon, which had me a new one ASAP. I might note that this didn‚Äôt start happening until this week. We have had the replacement only about two weeks now, so this occurrence may possibly be another defective unit. I bought a protection plan because of the reviews about this product. I maybe should have just bought another product than this one. Independent analysis of sound bars at the time I purchased the first one had this one as #1. I will update later if I continue to have to reboot everything to get it to work. I forgot to mention I am using the HDMI-ARC hookup which is the one suggested. Update: I think I found the answer on Sony‚Äôs website. Using an option on the remote - ie:voice - turns the HDMI-ARC option off. Since that is my connection method unconsciously I have been muting for restarting my connection, when trying to set the bar for better voice, less background. This bar does have good sound, very decent wattage and a reasonable price. I will stick with - now - 5 stars."
"This soundbar is a great quality soundbar for the price.If your like me, and have kids, animals, and other environmental noises, your TV's audio is lacking (like my TCL TV), or your simply hard of hearing (i have all 3 issues!).. this soundbar is perfect!It has several different sound modes, so you can switch between various modes depending upon if you want a ""home cinema"" feel for loud action movies, want the sound of the voices to stand out during long dialogs that would usually be hard to hear due to background sounds/music in the show/movie, or want to have a better gaming/music experience.. this soundbar has a mode for your needs.It's simple to set up (plug and play), simple to pair to for Bluetooth, and has a clean/sleek design for mounting and/or placing in your entertainment center.Overall, it's a solid 5 star for me based on price vs quality"
"The Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar is a solid choice for enhancing sound in a smaller space, like a home office. Its compact design makes it easy to fit just about anywhere, and the setup was super simple‚Äîtook me just a few minutes to get it connected via Bluetooth.The sound quality is impressive for such a small unit, with clear vocals and balanced sound. The bass reflex speaker adds some depth to the audio, though it‚Äôs not quite as punchy as larger soundbars. But for casual music, video calls, or even watching shows in a smaller room, it works great!The build quality feels solid, and I appreciate the integrated tweeter for a cleaner listening experience. Overall, it's a great option for anyone looking for a budget-friendly, compact soundbar with decent performance.I knocked off one star just because the bass might not be enough for those who want a more powerful sound or the voice setting. But for my home office, it does the job."
"Sony sound systems are typically durable and high quality but I was skeptical given the price of this one.I was surprised how good the sound quality is. I have the sound bar connected via Bluetooth and it works great!It looks great, is durable and light weight. I guess the only negative (if I had to pick one) is that the top volume is not too loud so if you have a big loud room, it might not be loud enough."
"Purchased this to overcome problem with Toshiba TV speakers distorting on deep base sounds.  Easy to set up by placing on shelf below TV mounted on wall.  Used the HDMI-to-HDMI Arc port on TV so soundbar on/off and volume are controlled through TV, eliminating need for included remote.  Tested on same streaming series where deep bass was causing problems with TV speakers. It definitely passed the test.The only issue is a lag time of response when powering TV on or off, and same lag time when adjusting volume.  This is a minor nuisance because the sound is incredible, and the price is great."
"Sony soundbar!! It‚Äôs gonna be great as compared to all the non name brand ones available here on Amazon right?  Unfortunately not so much. It‚Äôs a good, clear , slightly ‚Äútinny ‚Äú sounding soundbar. It‚Äôs hooked up to my bedroom TV . I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt buy it to hookup to my main TV. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a decent soundbar, and it is probably better than 70% of the non name brand soundbars here on Amazon but it‚Äôs not awe inspiring and it has a few features that chap my butt and almost made me return it. It has three led lights across the middle of it. They OFTEN (7 out of ten) don‚Äôt turn off when I turn the TV off. It usually takes two or three attempts to turn the TV on and off to get them to turn off completely.  The volume goes up in increments of two rather than increments of single digits. Alright Mr. Smartguy, I know that it doesn‚Äôt matter what the number is and if zero is zero and the first time you press up to increase the volume the number is two rather than one who cares. While I agree with that way of thinking‚Ä¶ it still just kinda ticks me off. Anyway‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs my two cents."
"I can‚Äôt be sure why there‚Äôs any negative reviews here.For us, this is a Godsend. We have a higher end Sony Bravia 42‚Äù LED flatscreen TVs purchased in 2010. From day one we used this TV permanently connected to an ex excellent audio system, bypassing it‚Äôs internal speakers. We have now purchased a 65‚Äù Sony Bravia to replace that set and moved the old one to the bedroom. There, we began to use for the first time with it‚Äôs internal speakers, and we‚Äôre very disappointed with their sound quality. (But we are used to the very best sound). That TV has rear firing speakers and this was no doubt a concern to our neighbour on the other side of our townhomes shared wall. This Sony sound bar has made a huge difference to the sound quality. It‚Äôs front firing, aside from a single rear port for bass reinforcement. This port can be padded down with a foam plug (not included) if desired to reduce its effect on neighbours. It beats the TV‚Äôs internal speakers hands down x10. But .... It‚Äôs ideally suited to bedroom use. It is NOT a replacement for a dedicated audio system of good quality. It will play loud if desired, but critically to us it plays super clear at low volumes.I suspect that many negative reviews here are from people with unreasonable expectations. It‚Äôs NOT a boo box, and frankly a device of this size will never produce earth shaking bass. Physics dictate that. Importantly is does not EXAGGERATE bass. As for connectivity using Bluetooth, and sound quality using music devices, I cannot say. We bought it sold for television use. I wouldn‚Äôt expect this to provide HiFi quality music reproduction. It‚Äôs pricier than many of the Asian designed and built ones, but well worth it. It‚Äôs a real bargain compared to many of the higher priced brand name ones that are 2 and 3 times the cost."
"Service was excellent, only hiccup need a international conversion power point."
"I bought this soundbar to improve on the quality of sound I got from my TV speakers. It is a significant improvement for general TV viewing. If you are looking for a high quality sound experience for movies etc., you will probably need to spend considerably more. It was a good value for my purposes."
"Great sound, multiple methods of set up, easy to pair via Bluetooth, incredible price!"
"The speaker is fairly small and very lightweight. It is easily portable so I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t mind moving it from my laptop to tv as needed. It came boxed with an attached dual usb and aux cord and a small instruction sheet.On my laptop I simply plugged the speaker‚Äö√Ñ√¥s usb cord into a port and the speaker powered on. I then plugged the aux end of the cord into the aux outlet on my laptop, selected a YouTube video and was all set to go. The knob in the front, center of the speaker controls volume. Turned completely counterclockwise there is no volume audible from the speaker. Turning it clockwise increases the volume. That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s it. One control. Very clean design. At first I turned the speaker to max volume and the sound wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t much louder than my laptop typically sounds when the volume is set high. I then increased the volume setting on my laptop which had been set pretty low and the sound from the speaker was much more amplified as I was expecting.Pleased with the results from my laptop, I moved the speaker to my Samsung tv. I plugged the usb and aux ends of the speaker‚Äö√Ñ√¥s cord into the appropriate ports on the tv. I turned on Netflix, clicked on the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫We are the World‚Äö√Ñ√π (USA for Africa) documentary and was ready to enjoy the voices of a bunch of awesome 80‚Äö√Ñ√¥s singers‚Äö√Ñ¬∂Tina, Michael, Kenny, Huey, Bruce, Lionel, Cindy and so many more. The speaker has a very clear sound considering its very affordable price point. I will continue to make use of it for online meetings on my laptop and entertainment on my tv."
"Sound from my TV was lacking, so I decided to purchase this soundbar. Highly recommend! Sound provides a lot of clarity and is easy to hear. Easy to set up as well. Very satisfied with it."
Nice little sound bar. I love that it can be separated into 2 speakers. I am using them at my desk for my laptop when it is locked. Great quality and value.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



This was very easy to install, just plug in and pick connection option. I used the HDMI cord, powered it on, selected HDMI on the remote and it began playing. The sound is good, a nice boost to a living room."
"I got this speaker to use at my desk for my computer. It did not disappoint! it is compact enough that it doesn't take up a ton of space, however it provides more than enough sound with pretty good quality for anything I am doing. It is simple and easy to use and works for what I need it to!"
"Plugged this in as soon as it arrived. Easy set up, just a couple of minutes to identify the right connections. Sound is impressive for such a compact speaker. Television audio was much improved so foreign language accents are much easier to understand.  And the price certainly makes this speaker a bargain. I knocked off one star because my TV hangs on the wall and I wanted to attach the speaker to the bottom, but that was impossible because the speaker case is not set up for that."
This is a perfect mini soundbar for my application.  I needed an external speaker for the little TV in my RV and this is a great improvement over the TV's built-in speaker.  The construction of the speaker seems to be high quality.  The sound quality is awesome and the installation via cables is quick and easy.  I have also used this speaker with my laptop while traveling and it works flawlessly.  At this price point I am very happy with my purchase.
"I will not bore you with pictures of the same sound bar everyone else has. Instead, I will discuss the performance of the bar. I purchased at the same time I purchased my current 55"" Amazon Fire TV. The bar has performed flawlessly. I do not see this as a ""basic"" bar as others have put it. Sounds like all bars are basic now from what I am reading.Never had any compatibility issues between the TV and the sound bar. Installation was very simple and my TV remote controls the bar simultaneously for volume controls, which is perfect. Please note, I have my bar connected wirelessly. Pairing the device to my TV took less than a minute. Sound quality and responsiveness of the bar was never affected by wireless connection.Bar is excellent with music output. I use the TV for Sirius XM radio throughout the day, and definitely during the night to help me sleep. Bass could be slightly better but sound range overall is great. It does not appear this bar is compatible with any external subwoofers. The bar is lightweight, portable, easy to move, and does great for movies, tv shows and music. Definitely intend to hold onto this one."
"The Amazon Fire TV Soundbar is a fantastic addition to any home entertainment setup. From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by its sleek design and solid build quality. The setup was incredibly easy and straightforward, even for someone not particularly tech-savvy. Just plug it in, and it‚Äôs ready to go. The integration with my Fire TV was seamless, and the soundbar instantly recognized the TV, allowing me to control everything with one remote, which is a huge convenience.In terms of performance, the sound quality is excellent. The 2.0 speaker system delivers clear, crisp audio with rich bass that enhances the overall viewing experience. The inclusion of DTS Virtualand Dolby Audio provides a surround sound-like experience, making movies and TV shows more immersive. I also appreciate the Bluetooth connectivity, which allows me to stream music from my phone with ease. Whether I‚Äôm watching a movie, playing games, or listening to music, the soundbar performs brilliantly across the board.Another standout feature is its compatibility with smart TVs, making it a versatile addition to any home entertainment setup. The soundbar is also compact and doesn‚Äôt take up much space, which is perfect for those with limited room.Overall, the Amazon Fire TV Soundbar is a fantastic product that delivers on all fronts‚Äîease of use, sound quality, and versatility. It‚Äôs a great value for the price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their home audio experience."
"I bought this speaker to connect to my TCL Fire TV.  Setup was straightforward.  I connected the speaker to the HDMI eARC/ARC port and it was automatically detected by the TV, so there was no need to go into Settings and make any changes.  Plus my TV remote adjusted the volume so I don't need to use two remotes.  There was a noticeable, tangible improvement is sound over the TV speaker, no doubt about that.  It's not a high-end speaker so I tempered my expectations but it is definitely good value for money.  No complaints there.  The only drawback is that there is a lag when the volume is adjusted and it is a bit off-putting but I can live with it.  Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this speaker."
"If you're looking to improve the sound for your TV but don't want to spend a lot of money, this soundbar does the job. It's not in Bose soundbar league, but it's not meant to be either.Simple to setup. Supports HDMI eARC, optical, USB and Bluetooth inputs. Produces decent sound and certainly much better than what any TV factory speakers can do."
"Amazon Fire TV Soundbar, 2.0 speaker. Works with Dolby Audio NOT DD+ or DTS.  DTS Virtual:X does not use dts codec, it is just enabled on the soundbar like a virtual 3d sound widening eq setting. Through Dolby Digital codec with volume at halfway vocals are clear and it sound pretty nice compared to TV speakers, but at lower volumes clarity is lost. Trying to use both tv speakers and sound bar leads to audio sync issues that your tv options may fix, but probably not 100%. I ended up using an optical audio cable instead of the HDMI, saving me an HDMI port and keeping my CEC capable streaming device ""FireTvStickMax"" in control of my tv.  Sooo, I Must use 2 or 3 remotes instead 1 or 2, fire tv remote, soundbar remote and tv remote if I need to change tv settings... I still don't know which of the tv's digital audio output sounds better, Dolby Digital or PCM?  Soundbar lights up green with DD, that makes me feel it could be more surround, but PCM seems 2x louder, lowering the volume they sound the same to me, think more clarity with pcm, but does PCM from tv make it stereo out to soundbar? IDK but I think so, you would think as long as the source is surround/DD then the tv pcm out should contain multi-channel audio.  I chose DD at around half volume, I can see 2 lights on the soundbar at half volume... and hopefully its more surround sound capable. I probably should have spent this $ on a real surround sound system, but this has a nice size footprint so it's not in the way and movies are more enjoyable now."
