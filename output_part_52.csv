Great value and came as described.  It is a perfect size for travel.  Well made!
Great for travel. Fits in a purse if needed. Secure closure and nice quality.
"I have the purple one, so my daughter wanted one of her own. Both of the colors are true to the photos, which is nice. It‚Äôs the perfect little size if you don‚Äôt have a ton of jewelry. I use mine for a charm bracelet and a few long / chunky necklaces and it surprisingly fits a lot of things. My daughter is able to put her dainty little necklaces in the pocket, hanging from the little hooks.It comes with a nice scent packet too, which was a lovely bonus. It feels very elegant to have it tucked away with my jewelry, and to smell it every time I unzip this little box.Such a joy to use this every day!"
"I love mine i have two and they are amazing for any travel and have a good amount of storage, they are durable, and a good price."
"I really like this case! I've ordered even cheaper ones before from other sites, but you can definitely tell that they are CHEAP. These ones feel much sturdier and I feel that my jewelry is safe!"
It‚Äôs a nice size and I like that it‚Äôs hard sided to protect the jewelry!
Loved and is made good. Perfect friend gift.
Very sleek and durable for the price!
"I LOVE THIS NECKLACE! It looks great on! The necklace is the perfect size, value and is well made.I think it will last a long time!!"
"Bought for myself, ended up gifting it to my niece! Then bought another for a friend! Very durable and true to size. Great value for the money. Beautiful shine and tarnish resistant!"
"I received this necklace, and felt it would fit a small child better than myself. It was not 18‚Äù in length. Otherwise, the quality is wonderful!"
This is a Christmas gift for a work party for a female. It's very delicate looking and printing is small.
"This product was a gift for my mom.  I like the fact that it's not bulky or heavy like others I've seen, however it's chain is very delicate so you will need to be careful as to not snag it on clothing"
"Great buy, and it came faster than anticipated! Very satisfied!"
Awesome necklace. I wear it all the time
"I have a small wrist and this bracelet is fitted without using the extension it comes with. Good quality, very shiny."
The sparkle from this bracelet is incredible.  It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful and exceeded my expectations.  Very happy with my purchase.
I really like this bracelet. It is so pretty and looks very expensive. I am so glad I bought it.
So happy with purchase!! I have a small wrist and I like it that I was able to adjust it easily with hustle. Really sparkly and beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
So beautiful and fits my wrist perfectly
"Saw this in silver at Dillards, but wanted gold tone"
Very pretty and shimmery bracelet. Came with an extender piece if needed for a looser fit. Love it.
I love it and looks expensive
I actually treated myself to this piece.  I love Swarovski jewelry.  Good quality for the price.  I receive compliments every time I wear it.  It is simple and very elegant.  Highly recommend.  Great for gifting.
Beautiful! Everything I anticipated. Loved the clasp on the back also. Perfect
I love wearing simple necklaces but can‚Äôt stand when they turn constantly and you can see the link. I love that this one keeps the gem in place and doesn‚Äôt move. Super cute!
25 year old male got this for my 20 year old female girlfriend for Christmas.Comes in an okay bag. Did come tangled from Amazon but untangled easy and was able to set it up for a nice gift display.Chain is a little fragile But 4 months and it‚Äôs held up fine. Size is a little small but all in all gal was happy
"This is a beautiful pendant, well presented which is perfect for a gift. Very shiny as you would expect Swarovski to be."
This is the perfect size. High quality. Great purchase
My mom loved the necklace
"This necklace is beautiful but unfortinuately, too short. An extension would grately be appreciated."
"Lovely chain, bought it to go with a charm I purchased separately. Comes in a lovely gift box perfect for xmas"
"Fettero is a brand that‚Äôs new to me. However, the two pieces of jewelry I have from them are STUNNING. (I have this particular necklace in blue and green‚ÄîI am absolutely obsessed with both.)The value of this piece is absolutely there. The price is so affordable and the quality is great. It‚Äôs durable, stylish and eyecatching, rests at just the right length, is adjustable, and is gorgeously crafted. I can‚Äôt say anything about whether or not it is tarnish resistant but I will say I have been wearing them frequently for months and both pieces still look brand new."
"This season I decided to add a couple of small necklaces which are very much in style, but are very highly priced in actual 14K gold. This lovely necklace is small but definitely visible in a quiet, classy way. It's perfect for business or more dressy wear. The chain is well made and the clasp easy to use. The color looks ""real"" and blends well for layering with other necklaces if you like...perhaps a simple coordinating gold chain. I have worn this a number of times and received compliments and ""Where did you find this!?"" comments from co-workers and friends. There is no sign of tarnish nor the dreaded *green skin* : ) At this economical price and excellent quality, this is definitely a keeper!"
I absolutely LOVE this necklace. The chain and pendant feel like nice solid quality. The pendant is dainty. The gold is shiny. It's perfect. It looks like a much pricier necklace than it is (which is a hard thing to come by these days).
It's bigger than I expected and the color is ok for me
Very nice quality üëå
"The pendant is extremely well made and very pretty. The chain,although very nice, should be thinner. You can't remove the pendant from the chain as the bale is smaller than the clasp or the little diamond dangle. But the quality and presentation is excellent."
Very pretty!! Matches my birthstone.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



These are beautiful, although I thought I was getting at least a 1.5ct pair at the time.After wearing these for a while, I love the screw back, they are secure and can be worn in the shower and while sleeping without causing me any discomfort.The pair I got came with a certificate of I1 and above with unknown color rating, so for comparison, I have a D color rating .25 ct, VVS1+, flawless ring for comparison, for the price the earrings are really clean and sparkly. My pair was 5mm and 5.1mm so slightly above 1ct total."
I just received these earrings today and am thrilled with them.  They are beautiful.  Just what I wanted.  The screw-on backs are great too.  Well worth the price!  They look like I spent twice or three times as much money.
Pleasantly surprised that these are larger than I expect and have a beautiful sparkle. Downside: it took two weeks to ship but luckily I ordered early!
Although sold as 1/3 of a carat- it's the smallest 1/3 of a carat I've ever seen. The diamonds are just to small for the price. If the quality is good; it's hard to tell because they are to small to even see. The screw backs are not easily attachable which makes me think the posts are not properly scored.  I'm going to return these since they were a gift I simply can't give!
"Earrings look fine not quite as good as a pair I purchased at a fine jewelry store was hard to get. Thought it first with the screw on backs, but once I got them on, they are very secure and can leave them on I was. skeptical that I did not get any. certificate with the earrings. I never did get them checked out by a jeweler. I‚Äôm just gonna trust. They are real diamonds and keep them. for the size of the diamond and the price I paid I‚Äôm going to keep them as it‚Äôs a fair price."
I bought mine to wear 24/7 in my pierced ears since the openings were almost closed from disuse. Very comfortable and attractive although small (which is what I wanted so they didn‚Äôt poke me when sleeping). I have a terrible nickel allergy but had absolutely no reaction to wearing them.
"The original price is a ridiculous inflated price that does not reflect a remotely competitive price, in order to make the 50% off price attention getting.  Compared to the general market for this size, color, and quality, the 50% off price is okay - not a great deal. I wanted screw back so they are very secure, which they have and are good."
"I was worried about the brightness and color, but I was not disappointed.  Studs are a nice size and I really like the screw backs"
"They were a bit smaller than I had envisioned. The diamonds are 'pretty' brilliant. Not 'really' brilliant, but for the price they are good value."
"Gorgeous.  I like the screw back too, they feel very secure."
"Got these for a significant other and she totally loves them. I am pleased. The backing clamp is white gold too and the screw gives you peace of mind. Additionally, you get a certificate on a card telling what you actually own. Which is a good touch. We road tripped all of california. She wore them a lot and they stood up to the rigours.Overall, we are very happy to discover this product, is a lovely pair. I have asked my girl to get them out for the lads.She got them out for the lads. Everyone was commenting on how nice they are.Great set. So pleased I went with amazon."
love my bracelet. It looks great and good quality .
Great value. Beautiful elegant bracelet at a low cost. I get compliments on it all the time.
I had gotten this bracelet as a gift to my niece along with a beautiful guess watch in gold from Amazon and the combo together looks very classy! The bracelet is a gem all on its own! Very happy and beautiful piece!
Beautiful & it fit ! Great gift for her Ô£ø√º¬¥‚àÇÔ£ø√º√®¬∫
"This bracelet is very beautiful, it is the perfect piece to wear often. Easy to clasp on and off and very practical price for such a gorgeous piece of jewelry."
The bracelet is pretty but the clasp is easy to come undone. Wear with caution.
Everything was ok. Thanks
Love this bracelet!  Had one previously and they have vastly improved the clasp!
"I love pavoi jewelry. I almost solely wear huggie earrings and everything I have from the brand is amazing, great quality, and the price is right. I‚Äôve been wanting a tennis bracelet, but didn‚Äôt want to shell out the big bucks. This looks fantastic! So sparkly and very comfortable. I have larger wrists and purchase the 7.5."
"I've purchased several pieces of jewlery from pavoi in the past and they've all held up well. I wear my jewlery 24/7 so far this bracelet is holding up just as well as my other purchases, it hasnt tatnished at all. The bracelet is super sparkly, so gorgeous. It's actually quite lightweight and very comfortable to wear. The clasp is a bit tight but I'd rather it too tight than loose. Gorgeous tennis bracelet for an amazing price. I will definitely be purchasing another one"
"Love the way this bracelet looks with my stack, super shiny! I had a similar one from target that tarnished super quickly, but i‚Äôve been wearing this in the shower and have swam in it and it still looks super great! I never take my jewelry off and this has not tarnished i‚Äôm super impressed. Always swear by pavoi jewelry :)"
"Bought this as a gift. Comes in a small green box that says PAVOI in gold letters. Bracelet is in a small pouch inside the box. Wish it came on a velvet bed instead. The bracelet is gift ready.The bracelet is very pretty and shiny. It looks great for formal and casual wear. It‚Äôs definitely a step up from simple bracelets. It‚Äôs also got a premium feel to it.Overall, worth the money. It‚Äôs a nice piece of jewelry. You don‚Äôt have to spend much for good pieces and thankfully this is a good example.I rarely buy jewelry and I‚Äôm pleased with this purchase. I am not sponsored at all and rarely write reviews."
After reading so many positive reviews I decided to get this bracelet. It‚Äôs so pretty and sparkles as if it were diamonds. The only thing I did notice was the clasp is a little hard to open/close. I would definitely order again in the silver. Over all I‚Äôm super happy with this bracelet!
"it was absolutely lovely. I had one previous to this, not same company and the clasp broke so I needed another one."
"This is a beautiful bracelet that I have gotten so many comments on-I do wear it everyday and after two weeks-still looks as good as the first day I put it on! I have the yellow gold and it complements the sparkly cubic zirconia stones perfectly. Seems sturdy enough and for the price, if it did break, I would certainly replace!"

"Context - purchase for 10 day vacation. Wore nonstop all 10 days, but avoided showers, and water or soap in general. Did not baby it however. Eg it got knocked around pretty bad. Since then have worn it for again on and off for about 1 month.Pros -Sturdy - bracelet never fell off. Stones are all still there. Clasp is really strong* con on this laterSparkly - very sparkly. Decent sized stones too. Looks real almost. I have noticed slight dulling over the course of the 1.5 months.Wear / tarnish - the outside still looks really good. *the inside where it touches your skin has tarnished and is revealing a bronze color. I don‚Äôt mind since you can‚Äôt see it.Does not turn skin green or at least not meDidn‚Äôt really catch on my clothes so the prongs seem to be well made.Cons- it‚Äôs hard to put on and take off. The clasp is SO hard to pry open especially if you have fake nails be careful of chipping a nail- again it does tarnish. Don‚Äôt expose it to water, lotion, soap, etc.Overall, highly recommend. Maybe more for short term use due to the tarnishing and dulling OR for special one off occasions. It‚Äôs really pretty in person and reliable."
Fits my wrist like a glove (6.5inch) and is good quality I shower with it and never take it off. Kt is very shiny and looks really nice and good quality.
"This compact and enjoyable speaker offers a range of features at a very reasonable price. It comes with Bluetooth connectivity and some unique features like covers for the ports to protect the unit when outdoors. The device feels sturdy and appears to be designed to withstand rough handling, making it suitable for outdoor use. I appreciate the USB power option, which eliminates the need for inconvenient connectors and mini-USB cables. The speaker delivers clear and well-balanced sound with a good range that travels effectively. It also provides excellent battery life, which is a hallmark of Sony products. Overall, I highly recommend this speaker."
"I use this to connect to my TV when I want sound up close to me that does not bother others in the house...it works great for that.  It's very compact and does not take up much space.  It connects easily to my Samsung TV.  Sound quality for that use is excellent.  And while I'm sure it would do well on a patio or in a room playing music where the environment is not too noisy, this is not going to boom sound at higher volumes like Sony's or others' larger speakers.  If you want that kind of volume, this is not the ""droid you are looking for.""  Battery life is very good...I haven't run it to when it ""dies,"" but I do typically run it for 10-12 hours without recharging.Well made - I've dropped it several times and no damage.Sony quality in a small package!"
