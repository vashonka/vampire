This is a great set of bands! Iâ€™m learning how to use them and this set is super easy and nice too.
Love these. I like how itâ€™s easy to stack the weight and the bands are thick enough to not snap. Have lasted me over a year and are easy to store.
"This product is as seen in the photos and description. It includes 5 resistant bands from 10l. to 50lb weight. Hand and ankle staps. The door hook to rook resistant bands to door. A do not disturd sign and pamphlet of different exercises. And all of this fits into a bag. I've been using these for a week or so, and I have no complaints. The hooks are metal. I have no worry that they will snap."
One of the clips already broken
The black starp is found broken into two pieces
"I love the bands, I do get in a good workout in the mornings with them. Iâ€™m a few months Iâ€™ll order mens for more weight resistance."
"I’m sure there are a million products PTs use, but this is a super simple and very effective way to strength train your muscles after surgery (rotator cuff in my case).  Therband is the brand my office uses and the price was reasonable.  I use them twice daily right now and they’ve worked well.Not sure what folks are talking about when the mention an odd smell.  They smell like a giant rubber band sort of.  It isn’t offensive to me at all, but that’s subjective I suppose.  Durable so far and I can use them easily in multiple places such as at work.  Light weight and easily transported."
"Purchased for use during recovery from a total knee replacement after using them during physical therapy.  There are many different levels of resistance bands you can purchase and finding the right ones is quite important and this brand or level was just too strong for my needs.  However, I was very pleased with the quality of the product, its length and width, but it would be helpful if the product came with an illustrated workout guide.  On their Amazon site they do show at least three band exercises, but it would be much more useful if it was provided with this product.  Excellent pricing and would still recommend this product for anyone needing a higher resistance band."
"I got the non-latex beginner set.I like the versatility of the bands. There are Low impact. Many types exercises you can do with them.These bands work as expected and the quality is very good. No rubber smell.After a month of regular uses, the bands are still in great condition.I have not had any issue with bands snapping.A few comments about reviews bands breaking -The bands stretch up to a point.As you stretch the bands you can feel when you reach the limit.If that is not enough go to a higher resistance band.Just like a common rubber-band it will stretch until it snaps."
"When it comes to bands the Theraband style of band has been the most useful in our gym. They are easy to grab on to and adapt to both strength and mobility exercises. I know a lot of companies make bands in the same style, but I understand Theraband is the original and still the best.I most recently bought the latex band set that includes the blue and black bands. They are fairly low resistance on their own, so I usually use them together to get the right resistance. I particularly like them for band pull-aparts, face pulls, triceps pushdowns, abdominal work, and more. I much prefer these over tube style bands.Theraband has options for both latex and non-latex bands. I have both, but prefer latex bands, since it is a  natural material. Though in use, both work equally well. I've also found that both hold up well too, as I've not had any break on me, despite a lot of use.I do wish that the Advanced or Super Advanced sets included a Gold band (max resistance). As far as I can tell, it is only possible to get the Gold band by buying an entire 6-yard roll. Inclusion of a Gold (max) band would reduce the need for doubling-up bands to get more resistance.Other than the desire for a higher resistance band, I highly recommend these. As far as gym equipment goes, they are the best bang for the buck in terms of versatility."
Long enough to use no matter what exercises my trainer comes up with. Very nice
"I have done calisthenics and weight lifting. After a shoulder injury I couldn't continue my workouts the same way. Physical therapy let me keep some Therabands which I use for recovery of my shoulder. It was a different sensation to use bands as opposed to free weights. The time under tension is increased and your muscles will be challenged, but your joints will thank you afterwards. Bands let me train harder without having to worry about joint pain, as well as my strength and muscular endurance increasing greatly. Anyone tells you that bands are just for rehab have never tried them.I quickly progressed onto the black and silver bands and I've purchased various bands for specific muscle groups. The non latex Theraband typically lasts me 4-5 months before snapping. Something I realized recently was my anchor points possibly caused structural damage so they might last longer now that I've fixed that issue. I use them twice a week extensively.For $15 I'm more than willing to stick with these since trying other bands hasn't yielding much better.A gym membership or a single kettlebell costs more than these, so keep that in perspective.Resistance bands don't last forever, but your body will thank you in the long run."
These are high quality bands for beginning resistance training. I like the 3 levels of resistance and their length is good for most resistance exercises.
Bought these after my son had knee surgery for rehab. They work for basic rehab but not a lot of resistance as expected.  Good value for the money.
I use these with my pilotes videos and I really feel the my muscles working.
"As a physio needing to rehab my own shoulder, the TheraBand Resistance Bands Set has been perfect for home use. The non-latex bands provide a smooth, controlled resistance ideal for strengthening without the need for weights. I love the variety of resistance levels, allowing me to gradually progress as my shoulder heals. They’re also incredibly versatile, useful for both upper and lower body exercises. The bands are lightweight, durable, and easy to store, making them convenient for at-home rehab or travel. Highly recommend for anyone looking for effective, space-saving exercise equipment!"
Product met my expectations and continues to perform. Noticeable difference in resistance between thickness/colors. They also do not stick together like some brands.
They are easy to use and there are so many ways to get a full body workout.
These bands do a great job of using strength resistance. Look up exercises on YouTube and they’re easy to use.
I love these to enhance my home work out
Work well while exercising
"great workout bands, easy to use"
Great easy way to meet your workout goals at home
they work
good exercise bands.
Honestly purchased these accidentally as I thought the were circular bands not flat.  I was going to return them then saw the great quality and decided to keep and replace the cheaper set I already have.
"My others don't have padded handles, I'll look for that option when I purchase in the future."
Use during exercise class and it works well.
I am questioning purchasing these as they seem kind of cheap.  I wanted a handle like I use at exercise class but it isn’t confortable and doesn’t feel very sturdy.  I was planning to get another one but am now hesitant
Easy to use and fun to use.
I use this item for my daily exercise and it helps to keep me in shape. The length and resistance is perfect for me and there are many exercises that can be done with it.
Good quality. Strong.
"Service was great. Unfortunately, I ordered a new set from a different vendor. There was no flexibility in these so chose not to keep. It's not the strength as I do use pretty heavy ones, but these had no give at all."
Effective exercise band for the money.
No complaints about the product other than it is too short for my needs. I will need to return it. I tried to find a measurement given in the description but couldn't find it and so decided to take a chance. I would urge the company to clearly state the length of the cable in their description.
This purchase was really just a try for my boyfriend who is working out at home rn. We weren't sure what to expect at first but they are the best thing I think I've ever bought for him. I love me a gift you can use. He uses these everyday along with a pull up bar and the results are great. The value of these are great for what you actually get which is a great workout. Very versatile and able to do several different workouts with it. Came with a very useful poster with even more exercises to do which is useful. Easy for men and women to use. Seem a little too easy for my boyfriend after he's been using them for a while but he uses them until he gets a good sweat going. We absolutely love them and will buy again. So far about 3 weeks in and still pretty durable. I would recommend this product for a easy but effective and cheap workout.
The bands are easy to use and help me improve strength and posture In my neck and lower back and neck.
"It’s OK, but one of them snapped after a month, but it was fixable"
"I purchased this product years ago, it is incredible easy to bring with you anywhere, the bands have not broken or snapped but there has been some divots in high stress parts from use. The amount of bands you get is great and despite the weight not feeling as heavy as it represents, there is plenty of resistance and variety of exercises you can do with this kit to get a good workout. The size of all the bands is acceptable, but I’d recommend changing out the bag they give you for one of a bigger size  and more durable."
Received my resistance band set today and used them to do a full body workout. I bought them specifically to use on my door that leads into my sunroom home gym. Great workout! Very strong and comfortable handles. Have purchased from Walito before so their quality was no surprise. Love the set and happy to incorporate these into my collection and workouts!
Works very well.  Good value for price
These resistance bands are very thick and high quality. They are heavy duty beyond any resistance bands I've ever had and facilitate a variety of strength-training workouts that target specific muscle groups and one's core in general. They can make it through carry-on airline travel and the TSA (at least one can space permitting).
"When I read the 1 & 2 star ratings on these, I feel sorry for some of those who were injured, but I also note several hints that some of these folks were using these items far beyond their intended potential.These aren't designed to lift both hands over your head.  That's just asking for trouble.  If you use the door attachment, make sure it's firmly seated and that the door edge doesn't have too wide a gap in it.  Examine your equipment each time before use.  Use them modestly; they are not intended for extreme exercise.  (If you need that, spend four times the money and get a high-quality pro system.)  You can't pay twenty bucks for exercise equipment and expect $150 quality, right?As far as the set itself goes, I had it unpackaged and was using it within 5 minutes.  It was easy and intuitive to assemble.  The lighter bands allowed a wide range of movement, while the heavy 50 lb band (normally out of my strength range) provided shorter-range power exercises. They were all valuable in one exercise or another.My only complaint was the width of the handles; too narrow.  The straps kept rubbing on my hands, warranting exercise gloves (and I have narrow hands).  That's a rather severe design issue... enough to drop this from 5 stars to 3.  The handles surely should have been wider.  Men with wider hands could not use these.Beyond that, the set works well, and for 20 bucks I couldn't really expect more."
"Excellent quality and comfort. I was searching for new bands. The details with the product for example, adding the weight of each band is great! The handles are soft and comfortable. The package is thoughtful with the signage to place on the door handle and the ball for massage. Great job"
The resistance that in way matches the weight.  But use the door hook for other bands. Not a total lost
Great option for working out at home! Diverse resistances can combine into 10 strengths for deep activate of muscle tissues. You can also have several different ways to use them due to moderate length.
"They appear to be a very good set of resistance bands. They have metal carabiners to connect the bands to the grip handles. When I first started using them, I couldn't help but feel apprehensive about whether or not the bands would suddenly snap or if the metal pieces would come undone and fling the hard metal at my face/feet. Hopefully they won't break or snap while being used."
Does what it’s supposed to good value
"I've done resistance training in the past with tubing and handles. While I think they're an extremely good mode of working out, I found the clips, handles, etc, fairly clumsy and ""fiddly"" when trying to just move through a fluid, effective, and efficient workout. Also, using handles make it hard to avoid a ""dead"" space where they join the clips and tubes.I find the resistance bands so much more compact, efficient, also easy to travel with.  The workout flows much more smoothly without trying to quickly change handles, clips, etc; with tubing I found myself taking unwanted ""breaks"", which was frustrating because they break the rhythm, the breathing, the flow, even the meditative quality working with resistance tubing or bands can offer. The bands function much more smoothly and lend themselves to good ""flow"" and mindfulness even while doing challenging strength training. I find the bands much more enjoyable and conducive to focus and centering than the hardware-laden tubing.The UnderSun bands are an excellent quality. Careful inspection of each band revealed no defects or irregularities i workmanship, and the material looks very durable. I believe if conscientiously cared for, they will last a good number of years, relative to how often and how stringently they are used, I'm sure. But they seem truly excellent.Finally, UnderSun customer service is stellar. My bands arrived very quickly, I received a friendly follow-up email, and offer of any assistance needed. I purchased a bundle which included a training package, and access to a closed facebook group. This group is very friendly and supportive, and the company is extremely helpful and supportive as well via email. They are just a really good group of people who seem to really care about others' wellbeing and fitness, as well as striving to operate an excellent, American business.I am a 66-year-old female with no affiliation to UnderSun, and I bought my bundle with my own money. My highly positive, 5-star review is solely based on my opinion and experience. UnderSun folks deserve every star and more."
"First I want to say that I am busy and usually don't spend time writing reviews...but if you are like me and considering the Undersun bands I wanted you to read this.  I thought about wether I wanted to try these or not because I am used to weights and for cardio I cycle.  I was a little skeptical but did my research and found the videos by Undesun very intriguing...With the gyms closed and the price of buying a weight set and dumbbells through the roof I thought I would give these a try. Being a little creative you can hit all body parts with the Undersun 5 Band kit. It also comes with a thing to hook behind a door which opens up even more exercises. Plus I use them with a  bench for more variety. You can really copy all your fav muscle building exercises and get a really good pump if your doing things right. Also you can do a work out in such a way that you will be killing it on cardio at the same time. Yes its a bit different but at the end of the day its resistance training and I have great workouts. With the 5 bands there is no shortage of resistance (weight) that you can create in an almost endless variety of exercises for every body part. So if your some huge guy no problem...I dare you to not have enough resistance! And if your a petite 98 pound gal the lighter bands are perfect. If your a little savy you will figure out that by simply changing your grip, stance and or amount you choke up on the band you are using will totally change its resistance level and act like multiple bands all in the same band...plus there are 5 in total all different levels of resistance.  Like I say, be creative, watch the videos they offer, and save your self some money on stacking up on weights in your garage and get a set of these. They store in a small bag that comes with the set which keeps things tidy. Once the gym opens for sure I will be back but I will still use these plenty because its just so convenient to get a great work out in. Hope this helps you make a decision."
"These bands just arrived today so I haven't actually had the chance to do a real workout with them. So I can't really speak to their durability, but I did a few test exercises and used the door anchor and everything so far seems very high quality and meets if not exceeds my expectations. Bands definitely do not feel cheap or flimsy.Update: Now that I've done an actual workout with them (only one so far) I can say that they do hold up. I put lots of stretch tension on these things and they did not snap. I don't notice any warping or damage or even minor tears. As soon as the tension is released, they return to their original condition without any sign of being stretched out, as if they were never used.Door anchor held up perfectly as well. The outdoor strap or comes with is cool added functionality, but it would be nice if it came with its own velcro or other mechanism for keeping it out of the way when not in use. I just rolled it up into a ball and used some of the rubber bands that came with the packaging to hold it in place and that seems to work perfectly.There does seem to be a learning curve coming to these bands from free weights and cable machines. I think mastering proper technique to get equivalent muscle activation will take some practice. The inverted strength curve of the bands compared to free weights and cable machines makes it harder for me to correctly judge how close or far I am from fatigue and failure and will take some getting used to.I am undecided on whether I would switch entirely to resistance bands with my current muscle building goals. I definitely look forward to at least incorporating them as a rotating part of my workout though. And there's no question that their portability makes for an excellent and convenient workout option for travel."
"I've used a couple of bands from amazon, and they all stretch or break eventually. This is the only one so far in the last year which has held up and remained firm"
"I recently purchased this set of three exercise bands, and they have exceeded my expectations. The colors are vibrant and stylish, adding a nice touch to my workouts. Each band offers a different level of resistance, which is perfect for gradually increasing the intensity of my exercises.The quality of the bands is impressive‚Äîthey feel strong and durable, providing consistent resistance without stretching out or losing elasticity. They offer just the right amount of challenge for various exercises, from strength training to stretching.What I love most is how comfortable they are to use. The material is soft and doesn‚Äôt dig into my skin, even during extended workout sessions. They also stay in place really well, so I don‚Äôt have to constantly readjust them."
I love the material of these bands. They make working out enjoyable. The only thing that I wish it has was more bands in the set! The ones that come in this set were great and great quality. Would highly recommend
This is not your typical flimsy and weak plastic band. This is high quality thick fabric band that doesn‚Äôt roll up or break. Amazing for those who have thicker thighs and suffer from plastic bands rolling up and digging in your legs. Highly recommended.
"Variable and stable resistance. Easy to use. No breakage like to pt ones you get. Doesn't roll up, very comfortable.on skin, performs as it should. Makes working out easier and me.more inclined to do it."
Great quality and the cloth covers are comfortable. The resistance level are a plus & ideal for home PT strengthening.Included is a travel/storage bag and a pamphlet of exercise ideas. I'm ordering more as gifts and for traveling.
The package contains three bands of different resistances and an instruction sheet for some exercises.  I have found them to be sturdy and comfortable and the exercises to be helpful.
These are so much nicer than I was expecting and the quality is superior. A perfect set for home use and already feeling it in my muscles.
Great product. They stay put/dont slide around like the silicone bands do. Love them!
They are so comfortable and ease to use! Highly recommended.
"I ordered the green/pink/purple set and they came exactly as pictured, each band in its own ziplock bag, and all 3 within the handy black mesh bag, along with a little pamphlet showing some exercises.  Sewn on the inside of each band is a little black tag that tells you the strength of the band--light, medium, and heavy.  The lightest band is just a little bit stronger than using a set of 3 rubber strength bands all at the same time.  I wish the heaviest band was just a little bit stronger, which is why I would recommend this set for intermediate level exercisers.  For reference, I am 5' 2.5"" tall, 102 pounds, and on the recumbent  leg press, I push 205 pounds for 3 sets of 10 reps.  In comparison, I've tried a set of fabric bands by Northern Lights, which is sold through Fitness Depot in Canada, and those bands are so much harder, I can barely stretch the heaviest band by more than a centimetre.  These bands by Coobons allow me a much greater range of motion.  I was afraid there would be a strong chemical smell, but these bands have only the faintest odour of rubber, and I had to hold them right up to my nose and take a deep whiff to detect it.  Overall, I am very pleased with the quality and attractive colours!  Highly recommended!"
misleading info about product.
"I do wish there were better ways of attaching these things, but they do include several ways, and the useful exercise that you can get for such a small price is insane, and they're super light and packable if you need to take them anywhere. I just use the black one, I can't remember the resistance rating, maybe 10 or 15 lbs. I'm about 160, Male, often considered fairly strong for my size, but this band feels plenty sturdy enough for me to get good exercise, especially when I stretch it out far and go for high reps. You can move faster with bands than with weights, which is a  interesting advantage. You can really rack up the reps fast. I can't imagine starting on any fitness journey without such a useful tool at the center of your regiment."
"Great product, easy to use and to setup. I keep them in my daily workout routine. They have different weights per color"
If you have a shoulder injury specifically a rotator cuff injury and you are having a hard time with this problem because of the pain and I've had this problem before and the best exercise for me was using resistance bands. If you want to use it for something like that then this is the best product just in speaking about resistance bands in general to help you with that the thing is if you're expecting to do like serious exercising with like a very high quality thick rubber band or resistance band this is more or less like on the basic standard quality it's not they're not heavy duty like professional quality but that doesn't mean that it wasn't a good product overall and it did deliver on what it's supposed to do and for the price that I paid for him I do recommend these for You especially if you're on a budget
Good for working out.
Nice quality stretch bands. Like that they have handles that attach
After using these products continuously for a few months to start me off until I could get my hands on some more heavy duty equipment these were good but the resistance offered didn’t seem to hold as I would have to quickly graduate to the next one just to feel some tension that made the workout feel like a workout
Good set and seems identical to most but eith a lower cost.
