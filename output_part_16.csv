The kid loves it! Very entertaining and good quality. I only wish the toy sound was a bit louder.
This is a really cute toy. My one year old got it for his birthday and he loves it. He has spent a lot of time playing with it and continues to go back for more playtime. It‚Äôs great quality and a great value. I was worried it would be noisy but the noises it makes are easy to listen to without making you want to turn it right back off! Great for motor skills. Easy for a baby to use and seems like a safe toy. The drumsticks have been chewed on and the tops don‚Äôt come off and seem to help with gum/teething pain as well
"We bought this drum set as a gift for a friend‚Äôs 1-year-old, and it was an instant success! He absolutely loves it and can‚Äôt stop drumming. It‚Äôs the perfect size for little hands, and the bright colors and fun sounds keep him entertained.The set is sturdy and well-made, perfect for a curious and active toddler. It‚Äôs also a great way to encourage creativity and motor skills. Seeing how much he enjoys it has been so rewarding‚Äîthis was definitely a great gift choice! Highly recommend for any little music lover!"
This is smaller than I expected but it‚Äôs a nice toy.
"I bought this drum set for my 3-year-old godson and he loves it! He plays with it every day and enjoys making different sounds and rhythms. The drum set is very sturdy and easy to assemble. It comes with four modes: free play, letters, numbers, and follow along. The free play mode lets him bang on the drums as he likes, the letters and numbers mode teaches him the basics of music and math, and the follow along mode challenges him to copy the patterns of lights and sounds. The drum set is also very colorful and attractive. It has three drum pads, a cymbal, and two drumsticks. The volume is adjustable and the sound quality is good. I think this is a great toy for kids who love music and want to develop their motor skills and creativity. I highly recommend it!"
Good size for lil hand
"I bought this for my child's first birthday, he's madly in love with these drums.  The noise adjustes for higher or lower sounds, the durability is amazing also. I would recommend this for younger kids. üòÑ"
My 2 year old daughter loves this. Makes a ton of noice and keeps her busy.
"Bought this for my 1 year old daughter, and it was easily her favourite Christmas gift, and is probably the toy she has taken to the best so far of anything we've tried.The sticks are padded at the head, so their relentless banging shouldn't worry you about anything breaking.It's simple to set up, simple to use, and you'll love watching your kid rock out on this. It is quite small, so I really would only suggest it for kids up to 2 or 3.Also, as far as I can tell, there is no volume control option on the toy, but the default volume is a very reasonable level, so I couldn't see it bothering even those with noise sensitivities."
This is great for a 2 year old
Kids love it. Not too loud so it doesn‚Äôt annoy anyone!
"I recommend this toy for a few reasons. One it‚Äôs fun, plain and simple, easy to use, figure out, and assemble. Two it‚Äôs a good price and the colors for the hair are neat. Last, I bought this for the classroom I work in (elementary K-3 students on the spectrum) and they love it. Each student has their own way they like to use it but it is fun, easy to show how to use and it has helped really well with hand eye coordination when using the scissors to cut the hair or putting playdoh in the hairdryer and using the push tool, making the Mohawks or glasses. All around not only do the kids enjoy it but it‚Äôs a neat toy and does not take up a lot of space. Makes a clicking noise when the playdoh is pushed all the way to the top so you know when to add more or cut. The center piece where you put the playdoh will come out when it is fully extended up and that helps cleaning the extra playdoh on the sides and underneath off. I recommend."
"The commercial for this kept coming up during paw patrol and I caved and got it. No regrets, it's super cute and fun. My 10 and 4 year old boys fight over it. The scissors are a little flimsy but the other accessories are a great. Just read the instructions before loading play doh or it's a pain to get out from the head."
"This is the cutest little play doh set for my toddler. She has been trying to learn how to use scissors and this is a safe way to help teach her. We have had lots of fun at an affordable price, which is great for these cold indoor days."
"I bought this for my girlfriend‚Äôs granddaughter.  She is 3 and her mother is a hairdresser.  She loved this, played with it for hours on Thanksgiving and took it home and continued playing with it.  It did not clean easily, as I kept trying to scrape the plastic pieces off.  It was a real mess that got in the carpet.  But the little girl loved it!"
Cute set. My granddaughter will love it
exactly what I was looking for. Can't go wrong with play doh ever kids always love it.
Christmas gift
"The instructions were practically non-existent. Just a bunch of numbered pictures that didn't show the plunger until the end. The turn crank was very difficult to get on. Very disappointing. My granddaughter did like it, once it was put together. I would not buy this again, and don't recommend it."
Very cute little set however way too expensive. My granddaughter does love it though so she‚Äôs happy.
Bought this for my granddaughters Christmas present. She loves playdo. Lots of uses. Great size. Good price.
A lot of fun!
"My grandsons play with these things for hours, creating new paths and layouts. The size of this set allows for so many configurations that they keep their mind active without getting bored. Their only disappointment is when we tell them it's time to stop! We knew they'd love this set, but didn't realize how much. Well made, colorful and just plain fun! I even enjoy coming up with ideas."
"Someone gave us a flimsy plastic marble maze. It didn‚Äôt work. Marbles kept getting stuck. Our 3 year old daughter was so disappointed. I ordered this. The fun hasn‚Äôt stopped. I ordered the smaller set not knowing how interested she‚Äôd be. We‚Äôve played with it every day in both a dark bedroom with the shades drawn and out in a well lit room. We are all obsessed. The small set works for us now, but I see us ordering more in the future. The glow marbles work well. Completely worth it!"
"Congratulations!  You‚Äôve arrived at the Cadillac of marble runs. After buying some other difficult to assemble and component limited competitors, I‚Äôve decided this kit is tons of fun and way better for kids‚Äô attention span.After opening this set up my daughter and I got to work making towers of exciting marble runs.No need for instructions, most pieces you‚Äôll figure out, and then for the pieces that look weird your wife will read the instructions and explain it to you later! The pieces are simple and connect easily, and you‚Äôll fight your children for the ‚Äúcool‚Äù pieces.There are lots of support pieces and several unique pinwheel, looping, spiraling pieces. Some pieces branch in different directions so you can build multipath runs that go in different directions.Yeah some of the connections maybe get a little unstable (there‚Äôs actually descent support bases) but we‚Äôre talking about building a marble run towers taller than my 6 year old.  If it falls and crashes who cares, just rebuild a new one! They‚Äôll only cry temporarily and you can re-acquire the ‚Äúcool‚Äù pieces your kids wouldn‚Äôt share after the crash and barter them back for promises of baths and chores.The marbles are glow in the dark.  My wife informed me of this on day 2.  So build your tower at dusk and then prepare for the spectacular marble light show extravaganza.In all honesty, this is a great set.  Lots of pieces, peak interest in creativity, and I especially appreciate there were no published designs.  It forced us to be creative and design our own runs."
"Fun, but the marbles are just clear glass and are extremely easy to lose for kids."
"*Updated: The more we play, the more frustrating this set is because the pieces like to fall apart very easily if you‚Äôre not great at creating a stable creation which results in a frustrated mom and boy. Keep that in mind if you‚Äôre child wants to do it independently and is also new to marble runs.That aside, it‚Äôs fun. I just wish the small set had more pieces, especially bases to keep it stable to be able to create different designs.*_______So I gave this a 5 star because although it didn‚Äôt make me feel like it‚Äôs amazing, it‚Äôs great for the price and quality.Our son loved it this morning during Christmas. My husband and him built a few drops.Pros: easy to use, marbles are pretty, the light and glow in the dark feature was a hit, and you can achieve a few different drops with the amount you have.Cons:This isn‚Äôt the most sturdiest set, seems to be easy to snap if you have an energetic child like ours so be careful, and wish they have come out with an expansion by now.Over all this is fun and the kid loves it!"
"Closest thing I could find to classic MARBLEWORKS quality wise. Nephew loves them! A little pricey for number of pieces, but all the ones I found cheaper were horrible quality."
"I have purchased this item twice as a gift for children aged 7 to 9 years old. It‚Äôs been a hit each time! It is sturdy and well-made of quality material. It encourages creativity and thinking outside of the box and provides hours of entertainment for either one child or multiple children at one time. I like that it is available in a few different sizes so that you can purchase according to size availability in the home, which is a plus. I enjoy giving gifts that fall into the STEM categories for children, and this one qualifies!"
I bought this fur my 8 year old son. He loves to build things. He loves it and plays with it for hours. I wish I came with a few more marbles. It's sturdy and can be made into so many different configurations.
"Sturdy, easy to build, and lots of fun for the kiddos. Happy with our purchase."
"Ever since I bought this item for my child, he never stopped playing with it. We designed dozens of labyrinths and he really likes experimenting with the different possibilities of the marbles sliding down through the maze."
"I chose this over cheaper ones that did look very similar and really feel like it was worth the money. I bought the bigger 250 one for my 9 year old's birthday. My 12 year old daughter loves it just as much, so does my husband. Huge hit!"
My five year old daughter loved this makeup kit!  It was adorable and you get a lot for the price. Will purchase again!
My niece LOVED this! Definitely her FAVORITE gift! Goes everywhere she goes! It's so adorable and the accessories were definitely age appropriate!
Everything seems to be good quality from what I have examined The unicorn is adorable and everything comes nicely wrapped inside of the unicorn makeup bag. This would be a great gift for a young kid that likes makeup and unicorns.
Bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Enjoys the items inside the bag. The bag is cute but not that big.
I panicked after I ordered thinking I made mistake getting it because of the clean up or staining but it came off super easy. Even off walls√∞≈∏¬•¬≤
This is perfect for a little girl that wants to play dress up. Much better quality than I expected for the price. A great value and gift
This arrived just as advertised. Great quality bag with lots of make up. Our three year old granddaughter is going to love it!
My four year old daughter loves the makeup and the purse is durable. The brushes are soft and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s overall cute.
Cute simple set that makes it perfect for younger kids. It doesn't have a ton of accessories so perfect for imaginative kiddos who don't need all of that. Good quality and decent value. Since it's small it's easy to put together and play.
Cutest little beginner Lego set! Interactive which is so fun for the kiddos!
4 year old loved this gift.  Easy to put together and actually fires.
This is a reasonably priced Spiderman toy that is perfect for his little fans. My 3 yr old grandson was thrilled to see this when he opened the gift bag.
It's cheap and cute. I got this for my boyfriend and he was happy with it. easy to build and it's cute and tiny
Fun to build. Love the finished piece
My son loves superhero‚Äö√Ñ√¥s but mostly Spider-Man. He recently has gotten into legos. So these were perfect! I have to build them because he is three and doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t understand that part yet. But if you know anything about legos brand they have amazing instructions. Easy to understand and amazing quality! I really enjoy building any legos. I have flower sets of my own. These hold up even to my son dropping them and smashing them. Every now and then I have to fix a piece but this is a sturdy set.
"Lego doesn't disappointment.  This age appropriate spiderman Lego kit provided accurate directions to assemble the vehicle.  The pieces were easy to sort and snapped in with ease.  This item allows for time together with your child or grandchild boosting self esteem and confidence in learning.  Learning, life skills and fun were combined for the best results.  Loved it!  Would purchase additional like items."
As advertised. Nice set
"I got this for my 10 year old.You get what you pay for. In the end, was worth the money for my kids.The instructions ARE NOT HELPFUL! So if you need clear instructions, don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t get it. We literally just went based off of the picture on the box. Took a couple pieces apart and retried a few times. However, all in all it took probably about 20ish minutes. No tools needed. It is a little flimsy. So if you are buying this for a toddler who climbs.. well don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t.Note: this is too small for my 4‚Äö√Ñ√¥11 10 year old. However, we got it because we live in an apartment and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s just not reasonable for him to be dunking on his door all day (so less noise). He likes it though. His 4 year old sister LOVES it, and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the perfect height for her. So I would say this is more so for 4-6 years old. If you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re looking for a cheaper , temporary, small space verified or kinda toddler friendly version then this is your best bet."
"my 5-year-old got this for a Birthday present, and he loves it! very easy to set up, he even got to help. It is lightweight very easy to move around if you need to change the location, but sturdy. Comes with 4 balls and pump to inflate them as well. Kept the kids busy for hours! highly recommend as a gift."
This is definitely for little kids. Easy to put together and move. Not sure how long it‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll last. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not too sturdy. Kids could easily reach basket trying to dunk on it but that would break it for sure. I had to stop them from doing it.  It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s entertaining.
"Pretty sturdy, yet light, easy to maneuver, easy to take apart/put back together. Comes with the balls and a pump so that is nice. Great for our 4 and 7 year olds"
"The quality of the product is not so great. It's delicate and balls are too small, the air filling equipment is very difficult to use.  Not so fun in installment. But, kids enjoy for sometime that's good.  Overall average"
"I was really excited for this item. Easy to assemble. However, it is more appropriate for under 6. I got it for my 9-year-old, and it is too small for him. Its a really cute idea for a room, and I liked the bottom to store stuffed animals with. Great buy but for younger kids."
"My kid had a mini sized real basketball about the size of the little thin rubber balls this came with, and he threw it in there and when it rolled down the ramp and got to the bottom the ramp cloth split. Super disappointing and a waste of money."
"My grandson just loves it! And so does his daddy! My grandson is 9 years old and we got this for his birthday as he loves to play at the arcades. So now he enjoy, together with friends, to play! And best, the way it is set, you can change the height of the basket! He just absolutely loves it"
Washable yet fun for kids. Better than other makeup for kids.
"My daughter love this product, we love the variety of items the product came with, very cute and a value for money."
It's perfect for a 3 yr old
"This is the perfect gift for little girls. The size is great, it has storage for brushes, the colors are bright and it has glitter. My daughter loves to play make up and it is easy to remove with make up removal or soap."
"The makeup quality is great , it‚Äôs washable. And safe for your girl kids to play with and it is a fun toy bring joy to your kids face ü•∞üíØ"
This is really beautiful. My granddaughter loves bath bombs. She is going to enjoy these. She will be surprised with a little piece  of jewelry.  She will love.
"The colors were fine especially as a kids makeup toy. The size however did supers me for it was smaller than I expected kinda like a jewelry box. Bought it as a gift for my 4 year old niece and she loved, used it everyday till the makeup was all gone, definitely her favorite thing/gift. The weight was very light. It was hard to open especially on the sizes but I was able to open it after a while. The price was kinda high especially for what you get, there are cheaper options but at least the ones I saw didn‚Äôt have the same variety as this one."
The size is nicely compacted. The toy my daughter loved and had fun with it. The functionality of it in the beginning is kinda stiff but once the drawers are opened they become more relaxed. The ease of use after a while is easy. The build quality is nice because you can easily store it in a child‚Äôs room.
This is one of the cutest things ever! The kids loved to see the plants grow and now have a dino habitat in their room. Wonderful buy! 100% recommend!!!!
"This is an excellent buy for kids who love outdoor activities, would definitely buy again"
"I bought this for my niece as a Christmas present. I asked her mom to let me know how she liked it. This is what she said. It was easy to put together, she did everything herself.  She loved putting it together! I would say it is good quality, and so nice that it comes with everything you need, even a spray bottle. The light makes it look so good! Everyday she would check to see how much the grass grew in the terrarium. She planted some sedum plants in it after the grass died and it is in our livingroom window. Great size for a starter kit. I would buy again and may get one for my son. Definitely worth the money."
"Super fun and cute. I‚Äôm a grown man who loves dinosaurs and sucks at growing plants. Hopefully, I will be able to make these suckers grow. I really like the size and design, it can fit nearly anywhere. I might move it to my desk once it sprouts. I will update as it grows!!"
