"Most duffle bags for hitting the gym are always way too big and make me feel awkward and weird.  This carries a full change of clothes for me, a towel and makeup wipes, my makeup and hair brush, and a pair of shoes perfectly.  I always shove my sweaty clothes in the workout shoes side pocket after I change so the main compartment doesn't start smelling gross, and the small mesh side compartment is perfect for my sweaty gym towel to air out.  It's perfect for what I need."
"Excellent quality material, metal zippers, “wet pocket” for wet clothes, fits in gym lockers well, perfectly compact. Very happy with this purchase overall."
"This bag is well constructed with heavy fabric and smooth zippers. It comes in two sizes and, unless you're headed for a short weekend, the small size makes more sense for a gym bag. The separate shoe compartment is a nice addition, as is a plastic lined  ouutside cmpartment for those sweaty post-workout clothes. Four stars because the large size is somewhat unwieldy unless full."
"This bag has a wet pocket with thick plastic water barrier, and a shoe pocket. It’s not to big and not to small, the size is perfect! I just think I made a great choice when I bought it!"
"This is the best gym bag, because the bag has a separate compartment for the shoes. We all know gym shoes can leave everything in the bag smelling like them. with this separate compartment you don't have to worry about smelly shoe scent on your clothes. It also has additional compartments for your phone, keys, water, etc. A great buy for the price."
This bag is very well-made. It has metal versus plastic and all of the zippers work very well. It is the perfect size for me because it fits in a small gym locker.
It's what you expect. Good product.
"Bought it for my daughter's sports activities. The bag holds her shoes, extra pair of clothes, a basketball, wet clothes and everything else in between. Extremely handy and well made. A good bye to the hundreds of bags and sacs to carry different things..."
"It looks smaller in the pictures. It is much bigger and heavier than expected.But it is durable, and well made, so it will definitely hold up. I think I bought the last gym bag I will ever have to buy."
"Great size! Easy to use and perfect for work, gym, short trip"
"Very sturdy and nicely made! Zipper good, roomy, high value for money!"
"Wow, this is beyond my expectation, I'm so happy with it.  I wanted to get a little duffle to fit on top of my smaller carryon luggage for an international trip.  This would be used to carry all the extra stuff that I want close at hand at my seat, and this can easily be shoved under the seat.  I can also put my purse in here too just so that I'm not managing too many things.  The material is a very high end looking canvas, not thin nylon or thick army issue so it's sturdy enough but not flimsy.  It's got unisex styling!  Size to true, this fits right on top of my luggage without any spill over.  If I find something I like, I go back and buy more and I submit a 5 STAR review for this!  Zippers are well made and the shoulder strap is a plus.  I'm not a backpack person either when I travel!  (When on the move, my purse/wallet will be under my shirt!)"
"SImple, but good smaller sized bag (fits a typical towel, flip flops, water bottle and misc).  Quality seems good (used for 1 month).  Outside pocket is very small, not big enough for a cell phone.  Inner pocket is good size and could fit phone."
My son needed a duffel bag for his gym clothes. He brings them home every week for washing and this bag is the perfect size. Everything fits and its not too bulky. He isn't easy on his things and it has held up beautifully.
Fits more than you would think. Zipper is durable and doesn‚Äôt get caught. Reasonably priced. I spilt coffee on it and it beaded right off.
Nice size but handle broke off the first time it was used.
"Very durable, easy cleaning fabric, strap is wide and very durable, perfect color, plenty of pockets,the portability is great, performance is perfect for cheer, workout, great for travel caryon"
I love the size of this bag and it makes for a perfect gym bag; it fits the essentials and also packs easily into a locker.  It seems to be well made and the two zipped pockets are useful for keys and other essentials.
"I bought this bag for my brother a couple of months ago and the quality was as shown in the photos. Now, i decided to buy for myself and the bag i received is not the same as the one i ordered for my brother.The quality is rubbish, it feels like paper, the bag does not sit straight and when you put things inside it, it does not hold. Save yourself money and don‚Äôt buy.I‚Äôm guessing they have changed suppliers and the quality is absolutely horrible. The brand name is not even on the zippers as it is on my brothers bag.I will be returning my bag."
"I recently purchased the Travel Duffel Bag, Sports Tote Gym Bag, and it has quickly become my go-to bag for all my travel and gym needs. Here’s why I absolutely love it:The first thing that caught my eye was the chic and versatile design. This bag effortlessly transitions from a gym bag to a stylish weekend tote. The sleek lines and modern color choices make it perfect for any occasion, whether you're heading to the gym, a weekend getaway, or even as a carry-on for flights.The bag boasts an impressive amount of storage space, with multiple compartments to keep everything organized. The main compartment is spacious enough to hold clothes, shoes, and toiletries for a weekend trip. Additionally, it features several smaller pockets, perfect for organizing your essentials like your phone, keys, wallet, and gym accessories.The build quality of this bag is outstanding. It’s made from durable, water-resistant fabric that can withstand the wear and tear of frequent travel and daily use. The sturdy zippers and reinforced stitching give me confidence that this bag will last for years to come.Comfort is key, and this bag delivers. It has both sturdy handles and a detachable, adjustable shoulder strap, allowing you to carry it in the most comfortable way for you. The padded strap is particularly great for longer trips, reducing strain on your shoulders.Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast, a frequent traveler, or someone who just needs a reliable, stylish bag, this Travel Duffel Bag is perfect. Its versatility and functionality make it an essential piece for anyone looking for a quality bag that can do it all."
Nice and big. Hold lots of stuff and has plenty of pockets. Has a waterproof pocket also. Durable and I love the color.
"I got this for travel.  I used it for a trip to CA.  I really like it.  It's roomier than it looks.  I like how well it fit under the seat in front of me, I still had room for my feet.  I was able to access cord for my phone,  my jacket and pillow easily in flight.  It has an internal wet pocket.  It was easy to carry around after my luggage was checked.  It has a strap/sleeve that fits easily over the handle of my carryon, rides nice on my carryon.  The quality seems good.  Wish it had a more heavy duty zipper but so far it hasn't been an issue.  I would buy this again."
"I absolutely love this bag. It holds more than I anticipated. It is sturdy, easy to clean, stores away easily when not in use. I live that it will ride on top of my suit case securely. Good quality."
"Pro- size. I bought this for a week trip, it was perfect size for flight travel! I was able to put a lot of stuff in here. Also has many pockets with zipper. Strong too. Good bag.Con - it feels heavy to carry and walk around. I expected it lighter since it’s fabric but it is feels heavy even when it’s empty due to waterproof material. But I love the size of bag so I kept it."

This bag is solid! The zipper seems fine, the fabric is durable, the waterproof pocket is great, the shoe storage on the bottom is amazing (holding all three pairs of shoes that I'm going to need on my trip). The trolly strap of your luggage handle is sturdy. The pocket to hold your boarding pass is wonderful. I do wish the very front pocket had a means of securing it, it'll work for a momentary place to set your phone, but I wouldn't keep it there for any length of time as it might either fall out or be snatched up by a slick pickpocket. I don't have any of the unfortunate issues that some have had. I ordered because of there being so few people with problems compared to the total number of bags purchased and high numbers of seriously happy customers. I figured with so many bags sold, there's bound to be a few with issues, but the odds of getting one with problems is low, and with Amazon's easy returns and exchanges, it was worth the risk. No other bag had 31,000+ reviews let alone high number of reviews and high rating. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
"A great travel bag for the weekend or for the gym. It fits a lot, the color is great and the manufacturing is also"
"I bought this bag to put in my suitcase for any gifts and extras I might buy while on vacation. Instead, I used it to replace my backpack. It holds a LOT, has inside and outside pockets, is light weight and strong, has a shoulder strap and shorter carry handles. It has a trolley strap that was really convenient, too.  The price was less than half of the heavily advertised competitor, so I say this bag is a winner.  I'd buy another."
"Absolutely love this duffel bag. The spacious interior makes it perfect for a weekend getaway or a gym session. It’s stylish, durable and sturdy. Love that there is a wide range of colours to choose from and the feature where you could slip it into your carry on luggage."
This bag is cute and Light. Nice for trips to the pool and park etc
"I used this product for my workout sessions. It was of perfect size with a section to pack my sneakers. It could even hold my towel to use to dry off after the pool session. Material is good for the usage and the bag was easy to use and handle. The colour was just what I wanted. The style of the bag was the right fit, not too big or too small."
"Has ample space for such a small bag. I was able to fit my clothes, shoes, a towel, and water bottle. Good gym bag."
"Nice bag. Good size. Seemed pretty tough, nice logo. Overall very happy with it"
"Got it for soccer. It' big enough for shoes, a ball, and shirts, but not ungainly big. Like the outside pocket for wallet, phone, keys (a key hook would be a nice addition). One side pocket could probably hold two pairs of shoes, the other side is smaller and a pair of shoes won't quite fit.Fabric is lightweight but appears durable, zippers are smooth. U shaped top opening gives good access.Good bag for the price."
"Bought this bag to replace another puma bag i had for years. This is a good bag and has a lot of room for all the stuff I take to the gym with me daily. The only concern I have is that if the bag is too heavy by the long strap, it’ll tend to rip a little. Overall good bag for my gym needs."
"I am loving this bag, it is the perfect size for taking to the gym, I am really loving the shoe pocket, I can fit both my gym and shower shoes in it at the same time. The big pocket holds my clothes, shower kit and a bath size towel and still has room to spare. The smaller pocket is perfect for holding my padlock and key for the lockers, and my headphones when I'm not wearing them. The other pocket holds my phone, wallet, brush, keys, hairbands, protein bar and it still has room for more without bulging out. The bag has been holding up great, the shoulder strap is not annoying and does not dig into my shoulder. My only issue is that it is about 1/2 inch too long for the lockers at my gym so I have to stand it on end but I blame that on the gym lockers not the bag."
Great bag perfect size to take to the gym will order one more
"For about a year now, this duffle bag has been my gym buddy. Its style is appealing and I've even snagged a few compliments. The size is just right, not too big or small, and the compartments are well thought out - especially the one for shoes, which I find particularly useful.However, I did run into some issues. The zipper occasionally gets stuck, which is a bit concerning as I don't want it to give up on me in the future. The material, while appearing decent, is a bit on the thin and stiff side, which might explain why it feels slightly less durable. In fact, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't hold up well if I were to pack in heavy stuff.Despite these hitches, the bag still serves its purpose for light gym use and stands out in terms of style. Therefore, I'm giving it 4 stars. It's not flawless, but it's been a solid gym companion for me."
You will love it when you use it
"Very nice bag at half the price (or more) of other sport bags.  Good quality and good size.  Although the dimensions were not mentioned, I took a chance, and was delighted.  This is a perfect (if not more) weekend bag, student bag or gym bag.  We are using it to carry my son's football equipment.  It fits his large bulky helmet, his cleats and 2 huge insulated water bottles.  The side pockets fit his small towel and accessories such as SPF, hand sanitizer, keys..etc.  With all that, we don't even need to force the zipper closed, and I'm sure we can squeeze in more.  Only downfall, the shoulder strap is not padded.  Although it is not mentioned and not shown in the pictures, I decided to ask this in the Q&A..and recieved a response that it is padded.  However, it is not, and the description and pictures were exact.  Great bag though, so we are keeping it anyway.  If you absolutely want a padded shoulder strap, you can purchase one separately if in time the bag proves to be uncomfortable.  So far, we do not have much weight in it and only carry it for minutes at a time."
"I purchased this for my son, who is in 2nd grade, and is playing basketball for his first season. The bag suits him perfectly and he loves the design, space it provides for all of his equipment, and how light it is when carrying. Overall, If you're looking for something easy to transport, prioritize affordability, or relish hands-free carrying options, this duffel bag could be your perfect travel companion."
Didn‚Äôt have any problem with stitches and the quality is okay but I also believe that material is not the best. I am happy with the compartments. The size is larger than what I expected but I‚Äôm happy overall.
"Great bag, good quality, decent size"
"This Puma Gym Bag appears to be of good quality for the price (note: I purchased on a sale) and is very spacious. It is light and convenient, with many useful pockets and straps. I am very satisfied with its functionality so far.The quality of shipping itself is one of the poorest I have ever received from an Amazon order. The bag was free floating inside a cardboard box that was so horribly damaged during shipping that the tape sealing the box had mostly broken. The box barely remained intact enough to keep the gym bag from falling out on its own (picture of the box's condition upon delivery included). Shipping was also extremely slow, taking weeks. Absolutely appalling shipping service but the bag seemed to be undamaged, fortunately."
It was a gift for a friend and he loved it. He uses it for the gym and is sturdy a d looks nice.
"This is a fantastic, spacious gym bag with plenty of room and compartments for all your personal items and gym essentials. It easily fits all of my martial arts gear‚Äîand then some!"
"Really good duffle bag, perfect for traveling. Not too big not too small. And price is amazing"
This bag has a high end look to it. I am not sure about the sturdiness of it as yet because I have just received it but the shoe compartment is spacious and more than adequate. My 9 year old son loves it already

Quality there i bought it because someone else did the video this guy deserve money thanks bud !"
Very good quality and good price.
"The bag squeaks a little when I wear it which can get annoying but honestly it’s a great size for gym bag and can carry several things at once like shoes, clothes, boxing gloves and toiletries. It’s great for traveling too. Love the color and look! If you take care of it it’ll hold up well without looking dirty (which I always worry about with white or beige colored things)."
"I’ve had many name brand gym bags and this is the best in quality so far - and for the price! Love the vented shoe pocket, strap is comfortable and sleek look for carrying into work."
"I loved this bag, really spacious and beautiful color, i use it for the gym and sleepovers"

I opted for the small and for my needs it is just the right size. Plenty of room for my towel, bathing suit, shoes, change of clothes, bands, water bottle, and other gym equipment. I like that it’s waterproof, makes it easy to clean. I also like the simple style and the bungee on the side is perfect when you need a little more space. I haven’t used it long enough to comment on how durable it is, but will update if I have any issues."
"this is the first bagsmart product I’ve bought, and I am not disappointed! the quality is amazing for the price, and the deep green is a beautiful color. it’s held up wonderfully over time, so it’s durable. I use this bag for my figure skates and all necessary accessories (hard guards, gloves, screw driver, lace tape, etc) and there is plenty of room for everything. the pockets on the inside and outside make it super easy to organize all my things. the strap is also sturdy and comfortable. bagsmart is now my number 1 go to for bags!!"
Prefect size. Use it mainly for the gym. Great bag to have.
"I bought this bag last year to use as a gym bag, in off white. Super cute! I still use this bag almost daily for the gym and travel and it's in great condition. Comfy and great material that thick. Easy to clean- I just throw it in the washer. Spacious- has a shoe compartment, insulated/wet bag, plenty of pockets/compartments to keep everything tidy. For those price point, this bag is a steal!"
Has so much space and fits so much. Perfect for the gym. I initially ordered because i wanted to be able to fit a gym outfit and my work uniform for when i go in the morning or after work.
this bag is wonderful..it can fit everything you need plus more..the durability so far seems great and its easy to carry.
Use this product for travel purposes. Kept a lot of clothes packed and has lots of room.
I got it for my nephew and he loves it is a good size it fits lot of stuff in it I‚Äôm going to order another one for me
not thin material that will rip on you it feels nice its one layer but its pretty thick its a decently sized bag thought it might be too small it wasnt
Perfect gift for kids who are into sports.
Needs more pockets.
It is exactly what was advertised so I‚Äôm happy üí™üèæ
"Good I like it, good size for the gym"
Bought this for my son's lacrosse bag. Works great I enjoy that I can place his shoes in the side pocket
It's super great looking and very roomy!!! Love this bag!
"This product came at a reasonable price, it's absolutely game changer for my busy schedule. After long days at the office I have a quick efficient bag that has many compartments for my beats headphones, my shoes, and a bigger compartment to hold clean towels, clothes and other stuff. Also noted it is slighty waterproof I took it inside the gym shower because I don't trust leaving it in the room changing areas so it kept my clothes dry even after getting spritz with water while I showered. Should fit in deep lockers horizontally or vertically in small ones. Great buy. Thanks"
I like this bag. It‚Äôs durable and does the job.
"I really love this gym bag! It has enough space for everything I need for the gym; it fits a towel, change of clothes, shoes, and hygiene products! I also enjoy that the product is waterproof so I can use it at the lake and pool as well."
