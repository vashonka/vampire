"I love doing jigsaw puzzles, including the Wasgij puzzles.  Not too much of one single color made it fun.  Took a couple of weeks due to my schedule, but it was fun."
I have purchased a number of Ceaco puzzles and missing pieces are a frequent problem. I shall not be buying this brand in the future.
"This rollup mat is great! It’s good quality, rolls up easily, and stores away in a convenient pouch. It is BIG! It almost fills my large dining room table! I usually only do 300-500 piece puzzles. Therefore, a mat of half the size of this one would be fine for me. This mat could easily hold puzzles of much larger size. (1000-1500 or even larger)! So if you enjoy working jigsaw puzzles that are 1000 pieces or more, you will think it’s perfect!"
Not going to lie I was a little apprehensive of this but it seriously works perfectly. The pad is nice and thick. Non slip on bottom and nice smooth material on top. The guide lines for puzzle size is really nice but of course some puzzles are a little different/irregular so they don't always line up to the size. So easy to roll up and unroll and the puzzle really stays put no matter what level of completion you're at. It does move/slide slightly while rolling up but nothing that messes it up that can't easily be adjusted back. I had a cheaper style that I got as a promotion from a book store but it's not even remotely as nice as this one...was only thin felt and a blow up tube. So glad I got this one instead. Very sturdy and easy to use.
So much detail put into it. Love the ease of bringing a puzzle places or being able to put it away. The sorting bins were nice too. Mat feels nice and like it’s high quality.
I do like this item for keeping my puzzle organized and easy to try again to finish up my puzzle. I did look around for other options but I don’t have a table yet and I don’t want to purchase the upright one since I do want to watch my tv while working on the puzzle. It’s easy to roll up and I like how it has 3 pouches to separate the puzzles. The only reason I added a 4 star is bc Since I do lay it on my bed while working on the puzzle there’s a small lump . It’s kinda annoying but it’s a small price to pay compared to everything else it does for me. When i roll it out it does keep my puzzle to where I left off; so I do enjoy how easy it is to have space in my room.
"This Mat  comes in a nice solid box. ""Open gently"" Included is a decent carrying bag. It comes with durable velcro straps to help  secure your puzzle If you want to stow it away.  The mat is of a good quality, durable and non-linty. There are different measurements on the map for different size puzzles which is not necessary but a nice added feature, for setting your border. I think any puzzle enthusiast would enjoy this mat. It's worth the money."

This is the second puzzle saver I have owned.  The first came with a blow up roll and was made of felt.  It didn’t work at all!  I gave up the idea of putting together puzzles as I had a cat that carried off pieces and chewed them up.Recently, I was given a free puzzle and decided to see if they had any other way to safely store puzzles.  This one got great reviews and I decided to give it a chance.  I got the one that lets you store a puzzle up to 1500 pieces.  It is a great size and any bigger, it wouldn’t have fit.  I found that you need to roll up and open the puzzle slowly so the pieces stay in place and to smooth your hand over it as you unroll.  It is easy to use as along as you make slower movements.The puzzle saver stores nicely, but after just a few uses, the velcro straps are fraying a bit.  The underside collects dirt and hair easily due to static and is a bit annoying when rolling up if you have pets as it gets on your puzzle.  It also tends to shock you with static electricity as you unroll it which is kind of funny.  I like that it is black even though it shows any dirt because the puzzle pieces show up well against it."
I ordered this for our family ahead of the hurricanes in preparation for activities while without power and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Impressed with the quality and even allowed us to take the puzzle from hotel to hotel when we evacuated without losing any pieces. Allowed us some distraction from what was a dangerous storm. We ordered this with the “all-you-need puzzle set” and the kids really liked having the extra containers for easier sorting. Now they want to hang the puzzle since it came with hangers.
"When I started getting into building puzzles I realized there was no way I was going to complete them in a single seating and I didn’t have the room to just leave the incomplete puzzle on a table.  I’m glad to have found this mat.  I like that it has the dimensions of the puzzle on the mat and the material feels very high quality.  The trays are easy to use and roll up nicely with the mat.  The best part is that it works perfectly.  I rolled up my puzzle and put the roll into the included bag.  It was moved around quite a bit over a couple of months and when I finally got around to returning to the puzzle, it was just as I left it.  I just needed to push a few piece flat.  I won’t do a puzzle without this mat."
Excellent to use and roll up till I do more the next day
It's well made and very easy to use. Nice bag for when not in use.
"I have bought a few 2 packs puzzles made by Spin Master.  I think these are the best quality. Great pictures, paper and colors. Pieces fit snug. Will not fall a part when  you pick up a group of pieces put together."
"These are surprisingly high quality puzzles with a very nice matte finish and great image quality. The subjects are fun — and real. One is pulp magazine covers from the ‘50’s, the other is fruit crate labels from the same era. I’ve included a few pics of the magazine covers, both overall and close-up. Most cover subjects that are off-limits today, either from stereotypes (the “stewardess” and the Captain) or bordering on exploitation. But they all existed, and were widely sold to teens and young adults as ”Romance Magazines”. How far we’ve come in such a relatively short time.These are especially good for multiple puzzlers, as you can each work on an area as a “mini puzzle”. The individual magazine cover art is distinctive enough in color and style to be able to find “your” piece from hundreds of other pieces relatively quickly. For example, there is lots of red or yelllow or blue in the covers, but each is slightly different, so a careful eye can find the same shade, which is probably unique to a particular magazine cover. Ditto the font colors and styles.The same is true for the fruit crate labels, although we’re in the middle of that one so no pics — but it’s great fun to see the artwork and creativity that went into these labels “back in the day”. I grew up surrounded by fruit orchards in Washington State, and likely ate fruit from some of these concerns 60 to 70 years ago. I may have even picked for a couple of them, as it was common in the ‘50’s for orchards to hire teens who were looking to make a few bucks. We would ride our bikes to the orchards, pick all day, eat too much fruit, get a few bucks, then ride home. They also used professional migrant pickers, but were kind (or smart) enough to also hire local kids, which was a boost to our little individual bottom lines — and the local “baseball trading card and bubble gum pack” economy.Only downside is there is no paper image to work from — only the small image on the back of the box. We solved that by scanning, enlarging (to 8-1/2 X 11) and printing multiple copies so we all have our own “crib sheet”, which makes the group puzzling much more fun.I would gladly pay more to have a foldable puzzle image included, as many (costlier) puzzle-makers do. But as far as image and product quality go, these are up with puzzles costing three times as much."
"This Jigsaw Puzzles is enjoyable, but I wouldn’t recommend it for kids under 10. The puzzle pieces aren’t very clear, and there’s no support picture included, which makes it tougher to complete. It's still a good challenge for adults or older kids, but having a reference image would have made it easier to follow along."
The bottle puzzle was the hardest.  Both were fun to do.  Definitely worth the price.
"We really enjoyed these puzzles.  The pieces are not the sturdiest we've ever worked with but plenty good enough and none were missing.  Lots of colors, texture and text in the design made them fairly easy to work.  We did wish for either a bonus poster or at least a good larger size view of the puzzle on the box but for the price we're not complaining.  It just added to the challenge and we appreciate that."
One piece is missing! I notice this a lot for puzzle reviews… so sad. I would have gladly given 5 stars otherwise.
Bought this as a Christmas gift. Perfect for puzzle lovers.
enjoyed both puzzles.  good quality construction.  the comic covers were so fun and the fruit labels were quite pretty.
"The images were clear, the puzzle pieces went together well and stayed attached.  This was absolutely good value for the money."
"Good quality puzzle pieces.  You can tell whether two pieces fit together or not, versus cheap puzzle pieces."
These two puzzles were enjoyable to do. The images were sharp and clear. Colourful and pretty settings too. The price was gd too. Highly recommended.
This game is a lot of fun and it’s easy to use. It was easy to put together and it comes with a nice storage bag. The appearance is colorful and cute. And it seems a little sturdier than other ones that I’ve.
"Easy to set up, fun for all ages. Quality of tossing balls is much better than most out there."
"This ladder golf set is a great purchase. It's not only economical, but it's made of durable piping (so pieces won't rust, bend, deteriorate), its SUPER easy to assemble and disassemble, it has a built-in score keeping, and the bolas are made of some kind of rubber, instead of hard plastic, so I'm comfortable letting my young nephews play with them.  I haven't had this set long, so I can't be positive as to how it'll hold up, but none of the elements look like they'll fail soon. The ONLY suggestion I'd make, is to provide stakes to keep it from tipping over; while the base is a good size and shape, it can tip over if the bolas are thrown with force (as my family is known to do!). We'll probably use some tent stakes, but this is does not retract from the quality of the set, or my recommendation to purchase it!!!!"
Its a little flimsy but super easy to set and fun to use! I like having the scoring on the sides.
"This game quickly became a fan favorite at our community picnic. It was easy to assemble, endured wind gusts of 30 to 40 miles an hour without moving, was enjoyed by all ages, and packed away neatly in the bags provided. I needed an extra part and the company was wonderful to work with. I won't hesitate to buy more of their products."
"This is the perfect family game! We used to play a lot of corn hole outside but the boards are SO heavy. It’s really not practical to bring with us on family outings. This ladder toss set is easy to put together, lightweight, and super easy to throw in the car for family picnics at the park, camping, bbqs, etc. It might be hard for really young kids to play, but my 7 year old enjoys it.  My only complaint has to do with the scoring system. One of the “ladders” has numbers painted on both sides, with a pieces of plastic that slide up and down to keep score. After several uses, I noticed that the painted numbers are starting to get scratched off by the plastic slider. I’m pretty sure the numbers will be scraped off all the way after a year of normal use. This could be prevented by having the numbers etched and painted (though that would probably make it more expensive to produce) or somehow making the plastic slider smoother (maybe by having some kind of felt lining?). Overall I highly recommend this game though, even with the scoring issues."
"This ladder golf game is fun for bbq’s, birthday parties or just hanging out. This set up was extremely easy to put together, zero issues with directions. Posts are made of a sturdy plastic & balls are as well. Great value for this set up, would recommend anyone to purchase it."
"This was a gift for our 10 y/o granddaughter, but very nice quality and it fits nicely into a small bag for travel.  Highly recommend this product. Love the score keeper on each rack which is color coordinated to the balls."
"Easily assembled, for hours of fun, friendly competition as it comes complete with score keepers."
Great for all ages
"Good quality, easy to assemble but when you move the game the pieces fall out. Would be nice if there was something to keep them together until you disassemble it."
"This is great! This set of laser tag guns cost about $30 more than comparable units but after researching many sets the common thread was how much a paint is to keep so many batteries around..so, I opted for this set that is rechargeable and I’m so glad I did! This set is very easy to charge, the charge lasts, and it’s truly an easy to use set of laser tag guns that work great! If I had any suggestion for improvement it would be that you have a way to know if you shot an opponent in real time so you know how many lives your opponent has, but this is just being  critical because it’s all around a great product!-Keith M.Pcola Fl."
"I saw a few cheaper sets of laser tag on Amazon, but all of them used 20 AA batteries. I know the added cost of having to replace that many batteries would exceed the cost of this set in the end, so I went the rechargable route. I’m glad I did too because it’s a whole lot of fun, and at this point I would have already spent close to the same amount if I had to replace the batteries. Everything works great, no technical issues or anything with the set we bought. My son (8 yrs) and his friends have fun, and we’ve also had fun as a family playing together. A great gift!"
"This product is great. Very easy to use. Battery life is great and love that it is rechargeable with the standard 5V USB. My kids love to switch modes between teams or individual play. Also fun you can switch to stealth mode to silence my gun, and even go dark and turn off the lights."
Great fun!!!! Worth the money!!
"We've used this quite often and have had a ton of fun with the kids! I'm always a little scared buying things from brands I don't already recognize, but in this case the quality was excellent. Everything is well-made, works well, and I don't have any concerns about longevity.I'd also recommend considering the other model from this brand with the targets you wear on your back. After seeing the quality, I might have considered buying those if I could do it all over again."
I got these as a Christmas gift for my grandchildren. They (and myself) have had so much fun playing with them. We’re Building memories!They came fully charged and ready to use.They also hold the charge for a good while.Well worth every penny!
We got these for Our sons birthday and now we are looking at getting a second set because he and his friends love them so much but we often have more than 4 boys at a time over to play. Easy to use but tricky to store wish the storage bads that come with them were bigger with a drawstring so they could function a little better but overall we have been impressed. And buying these was cheaper than one trip to the Lazer tag place in town for a birthday party.
I got this for my son last Christmas! never even used it but we opened it and put them all on it's definitely an awesome product but he just never used it yet!
"The Rechargeable Laser Tag Set for kids, teens, and adults is an absolute blast! It comes with gun and vest sensors, providing a realistic and immersive experience. The rechargeable feature is a huge plus, saving the hassle and cost of constantly replacing batteries. The set is well-made and durable, standing up to energetic play. It's great for both indoor and outdoor use, making it perfect for family gatherings, parties, or just some fun competition. This laser tag set is a hit for all ages, offering hours of entertainment."
Bought this for my brother & his kids when they came to visit. I wasn’t sure what yo expect but it was really good. It kept the kids entertained for days & seemed to work for all of them (ages ranged from 3 to 16 years) which was a bonus. It wasn’t too loud or annoying either which is a bonus. Everything was good quality & battery lasted a long time.
An outstanding toy for the whole fam. This got opened during the birthday & took over the show! We’re now considering getting a second set for a 4-on-4 battle.
These are fun and they stay charged long enough not to have to recharge in middle of game.
The kids love this so much we've already worn it out mostly we've only had it one season. The darts are in good shape but the connections that make the ring stay together are starting to weaken.
My grandsons enjoyed this game. We were disappointed when one of the tail fins broke off within the first hour of play.  Other than that it is a fun game for kids
Played with the dangerous ones when we were young these are still really cool and work the same just less dangerous maybe they are on the heavy side being filled with sand. But they are lots of fun to be had by all.
The shafts of the glow in the dark wings broke on all of the throw darts within the first hour.  Some wings broke as well.
"One fin of the dart broke on first day of use, rings just refuse to stay flat on the ground so you can toss darts into the ring.  Not worth the money."
We really enjoyed this game.
"The rings are really flimsy and do not lay flat.  The ""darts"" are decent quality.  The ""carrying bag"" is a joke.  Just not worth the money."
A good time was had by all.
Very pleased with the cornhole set. Exactly as advertised. But even more impressed with their customer service support. The shipping box was damaged in shipment. The cornhole platforms were not damaged but the carrying case was torn. I reached out to the seller and they expeditiously replaced the case without hassle. Great customer service.
They do appear cheaply made but for the price you can't get better. They work great and look nice.
"EDITED COMMENT: After a disappointment of one of the boards breaking after only 3 uses, I reached out to GoSport customer service, and they were very quick to respond and send me a replacement for the broken board. I told them that I would update my rough review to reflect the service, however, I also told them that I would update it again if there is an issue that soon again. I was assured that I would be happier with the product they sent as a replacement, and that the first issue was a fluke. That is what I am hoping for! It is a great set of bags, and I hope they last for a long time!ORIGINAL COMMENT: This set of boards is a very nice looking set, and compared to other sets I have owned/used, they seemed like great quality. However, after only 3 uses after receiving it as a gift, I already noticing strange bouncing when a bag would be thrown on one of the boards, and after inspecting it, I found a large crack on the bottom of one side.I was extremely disappointed that this happened so quickly, and am hoping it was just a flaw in the manufacturing of this one board. I am submitting a warranty claim, and hoping to give the set another try.For such a high price, there is no reason for this sort of lack of quality."
"Received my product, noticed a small tear in the carrying case.  Reached out to the go sports customer service to see if I could get just a replacement bag in order to not waste the product by returning through Amazon.  I not only got a response by the next business day, after a quick proof of purchase they shipped out a new bag with tracking.  10/10 recommend if just for their customer service team.  Kaley was the absolute bees knees and deserves a raise!"
The boards are great and easy enough to carry. We bought this with the intention of traveling with it and having a ready to go back yard game.
"Let me begin by saying that we love playing with our GoSports Classic Cornhole Set.  We have had our set for about 10 weeks now.  The boards are sturdy and if not exposed to the elements, should last a long time.  The beanbags are heavy duty and seem to be well made.  Then why three stars, you ask?  It's the carrying case and the customer service that pulls down this rating.  The first is cheaply made and the second is nonexistent.  The carrying case is important a) because this set is heavy to pack around and b) because, as already mentioned, you need to keep exposure to the elements to a minimum.  Not one but both of our zippers on the case have simply come off after only a few uses, rendering the case useless.  We then pulled out the insert from the company that came with our set.  It thanked us for our business and asked for a review; it also included an email address (no phone number) and implored us to please contact them with any issues we have before leaving a negative review so they could try to make things right.  Well, we tried...unfortunately, it is an undeliverable email to nowhere.  We can't find a way anywhere to contact this company, so without access to customer service or a decent bag to protect our investment, we cannot give more than three stars - that is because the carrying case and the customer service get zero stars.  And Go Sports, you should know that because you provide no contact information or customer service, we have decided to go with another company for the ladderball set we plan to purchase.  Too bad....this a great game, but buyer beware if you have any issues."
"I actually thought the rough wood would be a A problem, but it actually just looks like rough wood, but is Very smooth, which allows the bags to slide right in the hole! This is great quality."
"As long as you don't leave these out in the rain, they're great.  They are made of plywood and would come apart easily.  But they are fairly priced.  They come with a nice storage bag."
Seems to be very sturdy. Like the football field design.
"I got this for a birthday party so we could have an extra activity for the guests at the party. It arrived in a large box and inside the boards and bags came in a carry bag. Having a bag to store and carry this is super helpful, as it keeps everything together. The bean bags are thick, and yet light enough so you can throw them easily. The boards held up and have a stand to adjust the level you want. There were kids and adults both enjoying this cornhole game. I would say don't let the kids stand on the boards as it's not that sturdy but I would recommend this for a majority of ages."
This checker set is great to take with you on a picnic. Fun and naturally an easy and fun game for both adults and children. Highly recommend if you are looking to provide games for people to have some fun. The checker board is cloth and the pieces and large and looks great when set up on a table or blanket. Gets good mark from me. Very affordable.
Very good quality. For the price it surprised me how well it was made. Should last us a long time. Very easy to store as the mat folds up small.
"Looks okay, but the overall size of the board and the checker pieces is disappointing.  Had assumed, based on the picture with the single girl playing, it was at least 3 - 3 1/2 feet wide / tall.  Checker pieces are likewise smaller in diameter than anticipated and not as thick as assumed.  But, in the end the game is still useable and playable."
I always loved checkers. Taught my grandkids to play and the love it. Easy to keep up with the large pieces.
"This item was received promptly as promised by the seller.Our grandbabies love this item!!  The oldest (5 yrs) is a whiz at tic tac toe, but had never played checkers.  She’s loving learning and is becoming quite good at it.  Our just 3 yr old is now learning to play tic tac toe and she’s very excited!Definitely worth the money, good quality and an easy size to use either on the floor/ground or table top.  We would highly recommend this item!"
I bought this to put out at a grade party at a game table. It was heavy enough not to blow away.
