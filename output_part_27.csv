"What an amazing, comprehensive bartending kit! It has so many useful elements and they're all compiled in one set. While one would expect a jigger, cobbler shaker, strainer and corkscrew, it has a 2nd type of strainer, knife on the corkscrew to cut through tough bottle seals, an ice scoop and bottle stops. It even has the liquor pour spouts. Not the ones that pour only a shot at a time but guides to help you pour straight and not spill. A zester and muddler are great to have but not always something one thinks of picking up. They're also not always available in stores. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not a huge drinker and only sporadically entertain where lots of cocktails are involved but his has everything I need to serve up a wide range of drinks and do so easily. They've not only included cocktail cards with instructions on how to prepare various drinks but the cards are tied together so you won't misplace any. They include a small pipe cleaner with the deck to keep the liquor pourers clean. There's a small wooden rack to house all the elements together. This would make an excellent gift that would be convenient for the host or for guests to use to serve themselves. I did have a bit of a tussle getting the cap off the cobbler tumbler but just making a mental note not to push down on it too hard should solve the problem going forward. It's silver and supposedly dishwasher safe, though I haven't tried in the dishwasher. I didn't really have an issue having items soak a little in hot water and cleaning by hand."
"Not only does this set have the most-used tools for cocktail making, I especially liked that they are corralled in an attractive, custom sized wooden holder. The holder makes them easy to see and use as well as store. The branding is subtly added too, not emblazoned garishly across the whole thing.  Nicely done!"

What an amazing product well recommended."
"This Cocktail Making Kit is an exceptional choice for both beginners and cocktail enthusiasts. This 16-piece set has everything you need to mix up any cocktail, from classics to creative concoctions. The 675ml (24oz) cobbler shaker is well-sized and has a sleek charcoal/gray finish that looks stylish in any kitchen or bar area. All pieces are sturdy, well-crafted, and designed to last, which impressed me.The display stand is a nice touch, keeping everything organized and easy to access. The 35 recipe cards included are a fun bonus√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthey cover a wide range of cocktails, perfect for trying something new. This kit is also very user-friendly; even as a beginner, I found it easy to use and clean. It makes for a fantastic gift, too, thanks to its quality and presentation. Highly recommended for anyone looking to elevate their home bartending game!"
This cocktail making set covers everything you need to get started. Its made of stainless steel so should be resistant to rusting.The whole set has a nice bamboo stand that you can display your equipment if you like. You also get 35 cards detailing how to make cocktails.4 stars from me. Good set and ideal as a gift.
"Me and my partner love a cocktail night so jumped at the opportunity of getting this set!The kit comes neatly packaged with each individual item wrapped in paper to protect the metal finish. As I unpacked the set, I slotted each item into its corresponding spot in the base and they all fit perfectly.Even when we're not using it, this set has a permanent place on our kitchen countertop because it looks beautiful! The stainless steel has a very appealing finish that catches the light perfectly looks amazing on show.Practicality-wise, this set has it all. We've used the muddler for mint leaves for a Mojito, we've used the strain to pour drinks that required mashed fruit, we've used the shaker for mixing each cocktail, etc.The set even comes with a pack of cocktail recipes if you want to try something new!This set will come in handy (and take a beating) come this Christmas period, and I recommend to anyone in the same boat who plans to experiment with new cocktails this Christmas."
"This is great quality kit for the price. The wood frame is sturdy, well-shaped, and looks good. The kit itself is of nice quality, shiny, and solid. My only complaint is that the cap on the cocktail shaker gets stuck very easily and is hard to remove. I would buy this again, especially as a gift. It's a nice addition to our bar cart, and it looks more expensive than it is. Miniature is in the picture for scale (but not included with the product!)."
This isnt that great of a picture but i havent used these yet. theyre very good quality for the price!! So cute to display aswell and everything came together well! Very easy to use:) nothing was missing and everything fit perfectly! im happyüíå
I bought this for my bar station and it has everything I need to mix drinks and make what I want. The stainless steel makes it look high quality and it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap either. I also appreciate the little book on ingredients to make mix drinks that comes with it.
Great for the price. I put 4 stars because one of the items came broken. Other than that it was good.
I am amazed with this bartenders utensil set. At such a low price and such high quality it‚Äôs a beautiful purchase. There‚Äôs not anything that I will have to add to have everything needed to make our favorite cocktails. I will be purchasing this set for gifts for friends and family‚Ä¶everything from housewarming gifts to birthdays and everything in between.
it's got all the stuff I was hoping for and it stores really nicely.  great price and great look!
"Item as described, good quality, fast delivery"
"I just started bartending and I wanted to get these for home so I could practice and be able to make friends drinks, they are very nice and great quality, is has a few different drink recipes that are easy to follow, and everything is easy to use and clean, I love it!"
"This citrus peeler and zester tool is a must-have for any home bartender or chef. The specially designed channel knife makes it easy to peel citrus fruits, while the ultra-sharp zester holes are perfect for creating citrus zest and garnishes. The non-slip grip of the soft-touch handle provides a comfortable and secure grip, and the hanging loop is designed for easy storage. This tool is durable and easy to clean, and it is dishwasher safe for added convenience.I used this tool to make Old Fashions for my Christmas party, and it was a big hit. The ultra-sharp zester holes made it easy to zest the citrus, and the specially designed channel knife made it easy to peel the fruit. The tool is also quiet and easy to use, making it perfect for entertaining guests. Overall, I would highly recommend this tool to anyone looking for a durable, high-quality, and versatile option for their kitchen or bar."
The handle fits wonderfully in your hand. Great grip peels well.
"This handy kitchen device can take a lemon and cut a large-shoelace-like strip of the peel.  Really nice for a martini.  In addition it can make a set of tiny rind strips using the little holes.  That said, when you get it the big strip maker comes VERY dull.  This made it difficult to produce these strips without a struggle.  However, if you can locate a 1/8"" round metal file, the cutting edge can be dramatically sharpened and the thing then works much better!"
Did the job well
I used it once in the last two years. I chose this one because it was the lowest-priced Amazon option.  It worked perfectly because it's a commodity item.  More expensive options wouldn't work any differently.
"compact, comfortable to hold in your hand, non-slip"
Professional restaurant Quality! spent over 25 years in the food service industry and have held every position from Dishwasher to Executive Chef to Director of Food Services. Fully recommended for Mixologist as well as a Pastry Chef without hesitation!
Always wanted one
Excellent product easy to use
No more knuckle skin in my lemon baked goods. Much better and easier to use than a cheese grater. Allows you to zest around any bad parts of the peel. Makes long skinny strips of zest that I then chop finely with a knife a cutting board. A million times easier to clean than a grater.
Cozy and warm but not too heavy or thick. Love the emerald green!
"It's very cozy, no bad smell when opened, vacuum packed well, shipped fast. It's not very heavy, but it's warm."
"Bought this for my son who loves purple. It's heavy, fluffy & warm. Has been washed several times & holds it shape very well. Great product."
Super soft fabric. Machine washes well. Light weight but keeps you warm.
"I had a hard time believing that this comforter would be warm enough on cold nights, especially after seeing it wasn‚Äôt as thick as expected. However, I‚Äôm delighted with it! Perfect Cal King size, nice soft fabric, neutral gray and a great value for the money! I recommend getting a cover for it to keep it looking fresh even through it is washable. I found a nice cover on Amazon with the same brushed soft feel and it‚Äôs great!!"
Arrived on time in good condition. Not very thick for northern climates but does good here in zone 5.
"Bought it for a full bed and the length on the sides did not reach half way down. I think the King would give more coverage on the sides. Washed it by itself the minute I unpacked it. The tag got dyed red after washing, so be aware of it. The red color is ok, not as bright, but acceptable. Would not had bought it if I were to have seen it before."
"First of all, my wife was coming home from a surgery today. I use Amazon because I was able to get something in a few days. We have been using another ""comforter"" from Amazon for like a year already. It was time to replace it as why wash it after she used an iron on it numerous times haha! I know the pics usually show a fluffed up cover, and no this is not thick people! It is just fine as a blanket however and I ordered a queen and that's what I received. We have a Therapedic queen on a full framed in bed that is also fully adjustable. The cover fits fine, as pic'd. The blanket arrived completely vacuumed sealed yes, I carefully opened and it say for an hour. I shook it and placed in dryer no heat for 20 mins and placed it on clean linens. I did smooth it out and tucked in the end. No smells whatever (?) I put my big nose on it many times and no smells. The color is just like I figured and the texture is great. The fit is just like the last one...perfect. If you want bigger then buy bigger. The stitches show no problems and I looked it all over twice! Now, that said I cannot say what will happen in a standard washing situation. The last one I washed and yes got a few lumps, but smooth out with hands and after a few bed makings they went away enough to keep using it. However, this is an inexpensive purchase and may not be right for those that expect frequent washings and a big thick comforter. I am happy to not have to parade around retail stores until my feet hurt just to find something better. For now these covers will have kept us warm and covered just fine until maybe one day we find a better option. I would buy another one no problem. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the purchase and I don't usually give reviews. However, after spending more time checking reviews on Amazon and needing a new bed cover asap. I feel compelled to say this cover is just fine."
Awesome product. Totally worth buying.

I purchased this for my son because he gets so hot while sleeping but there are times it‚Äôs so cold in his room. The material is nice and soft. I expected it to look like a comforter for a dorm room.  It was full of static so I recommend planning ahead and leaving time to wash it before using.  The colors weee nice a bright. Sometimes black can be a weird shade. But both sides were nice colors. This is great for people who want a comforter like bead spread year round. I really like how lightweight it is.  I feel like it will be one of those blankets that are nice and cool to lay with while the air conditioning is on and warm and comforting when it‚Äôs 20 degrees outside. The price was reasonable for a full/queen and it‚Äôs definitely big enough for a queen.  As long as it washes up nicely I think it‚Äôs one of my favorite buys.  I may buy another for the Airbnb. I think it‚Äôs perfect for everyone."
"I‚Äôve had this same comforter before, about 5 years ago before I moved out of the country, and I moved back like 3 years ago. I bought it again because I remember liking how durable and comfortable this comforter is, breathable but warm. I‚Äôve been using a duvet with a black cover for a little while, and while the duvet is nice and thick and cozy, the fact of the matter is both the duvet and the cover were in terrible shape, and the king size duvet cover still felt too small for the queen size duvet somehow (unless I was given a different size duvet than it said on the label). I got rid of those because it was bugging me how it fit on the bed, and the fact that it didn‚Äôt stay decent for long. This comforter is so much easier to wash anyway, and I‚Äôm really glad I re-bought it. Washed it a few days ago, so it smells like fresh laundry. Laying on it right now, and ahhh üòå that‚Äôs so much better! I definitely recommend this comforter!! It‚Äôs not fancy hotel quality or anything, but, it‚Äôs really nice for the home if you‚Äôre looking for something affordable, but decent quality."
"This is a nice lightweight comforter.Equal to the value for quality.  It is perfect for summer, a kids room. I have mine in the guest room over a day bed. It is easy to wash and there was no odor when I opened it. This is not heavy duty. The size is perfect just as described and it is not overly soft but has a nice smooth fabric."
does the job of keeping me warm without feeling like a ton of bricks on top of me.
Very nice reversible blanket. Very comfortable and keeps me warm.
Okay product but not good for winterDoes not feel comfortable with this one.Quality not so impressiveI definitely not recommend this item.
"This is my 3rd one of these comforters.  The price is good, I figured if they only lasted a year it was a great buy.  However, I bought the first 2 over 2 years ago in 2015; the black/gray for my oldest grandson, and the orange/brown for my 2nd grandson. They are a med weight comforter, which is great for my hot blooded grandson as well as the cooler grandson.  Also my daughter is able to fit both comforters in her washer at once.  Some of the thicker comforters would be too crowded and not wash or dry as efficiently.  BUT here is the REALLY BIG DEAL about these comforters..  My grandsons are extremely HARD on everything!!!  BUT these comforters have truly  stood up to all that my grandsons have dished out.  For the first few months, one of the comforters was washed several times a week, sometimes daily,  due to bedwetting, ALSO  my daughter is regular about changing her household beds every other week, so they are still being washed quite frequently and they have absolutely stood the test!  They still look and feel great.  The colors have not faded, they haven't lost their shape, no shrinkage, the batting is still in great shape, no pilling, or napping.  They come out of the dryer wrinkle free.  What more can you ask for?  And at this price???  So now that grandson number 3 has graduated into a ""big boy bed"" I was very glad to find that Amazon was still offering these comforters and I have just purchased our 3rd one, this time in the two shades of blue.  My daughter couldn't be more pleased.  I am thinking about getting 3 more,  (1 of each)  just to put away for when these  finally do wear out.  You can't beat the price for this kind of quality!"
"I bought this for my granddaughter, she loves the dual colors,  it‚Äôs super soft, comfy, and has held up well on a rough 7 year old. I ended up loving this so much I ordered a second for my grandson. Great product at an amazing price!"
"I like it because it is light,warm and easy to handle."
"It's a perfect weight for those cooler summer nights, nice feel to the skin and a bit larger than expected, which is a positive."
"I needed an inexpensive comforter set for a spare bedroom.  These were priced perfectly so I didn‚Äôt expect much.  Man was I shocked!  This set is gorgeous!  I ordered a king set because I wanted extra overhang on my Queen platform bed.  The color is so pretty.  And best of all, the set washed and dried great and looks fresh crisp and new.  The fabric is lightweight with a cool silky type feel.  Not too thick so it fits in an apartment size washer.  Will definitely order from Bedsure again for all my bedding needs!"
"I love this comforter!  When I first opened it the comforter was very flat, I had to shake it a bit to fluff it up. This feels light but don‚Äôt let that fool you. It is a warm comforter. It is soft and just feels great. Beautiful looking in my room."
This set is so soft and provides so much warmth even though the material feels so light. I love the deep emerald color.

It‚Äôs definitely not luxurious but it works. It‚Äôs thin and lightweight. I would prefer it to be thicker and fluffier but the design makes it look nice. I washed it before use and it held well n didn‚Äôt lump up so that‚Äôs good. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs super soft, but at least it‚Äôs not rough or scratchy feeling. I have a king size bed with a LOW box spring and the cal king size fit just right.  Over all it‚Äôs good and I‚Äôll be keeping it as back up during washes but will be looking for something  more thicker and better quality."
This is exactly the quality I‚Äôd expect for something like this at this price point - good. It‚Äôs super cute and the perfect weight.
"Very nice!  It's a medium weight, so not too hot.  Looks great on my bed and is very soft!"
"Full disclosure: I won‚Äôt lie. I bought this for one of my dogs. Yep. Really. For his purposes I am happy with it. Would I buy this again for a human? Absolutely not.It is soft enough but straight out of the bag it has a horrible chemical scent. That will launder out (I hope) but it‚Äôs still a turn off. The comforter is also quite thin. Now, since this is for the dog and it will be folded that will be okay. For a human, it may not be as warm as you‚Äôd like unless you are a hot sleeper.Simply put, the design is nice and I like the boho vibe, but make no mistake: this comforter and the pillow shams are cheap for a reason. If you‚Äôre looking for high quality, breathable fabric this is not it.Do I recommend it? Yes, but with a caveat‚Ä¶ understand that you‚Äôre purchasing something that is inexpensive. If you care about fabrics and quality spend more to purchase something nice. If you just want a boho vibe on a budget, the price is right."
"This comforter is great for the price. The ivory is perfect... Not white, not yellow. It is the perfect level of warmth and coziness. I bought the queen for my full-size bed so that it comes down more on the sides."
"I am beyond impressed with the EASELAND All Season King Size Soft Quilted Down Alternative Comforter! It has exceeded all of my expectations. The softness is incredible, and the lightweight yet warm design makes it perfect for year-round use. Whether chilly or warm, this comforter keeps me comfortable without overheating. The reversible feature is a nice touch, allowing me to switch up my bedding style. Plus, it's easy to care for and holds up beautifully after washes. If you're looking for a cozy, high-quality comforter that fits any season, this is the one!"
"Absolutely AMAZING!!!  Delivers as promised. Soft, plush, warm, vibrant in color and beautiful.  Winner. I just need that Burgundy color to restock in oversized and it‚Äôs mine. I bought the charcoal gray oversized for my King size high rise bed. Perfect fit. Snooze and you will loose. Winter is coming üòÇ(my Game of Thrones Fans)!!!"
I‚Äôve been wanting to get a duvet for my bed for a while but just didn‚Äôt want to pay a lot. I found this one and the reviews were good and the price is fantastic. I washed and dried it and it held up great. It‚Äôs warm and very cozy. Very happy with this purchase
"Not sure if it is just an aberration but the one I got is thin. This isn't to say that it isn't warm or useful but it isn't the toasty, pouffy comforter that I was looking for. I'd say that this is ideal for spring and fall. As the temperatures have dropped to the 30s and 40s at night, we've added a fleece blanket which, together with this comforter, provides enough warmth for us. (For context my husband's internal thermostat is ""normal"" (runs neither hot nor cold) while I am perimenopausal and for a time was running hot.)"
"I ordered this for our king bed and am very happy with it. It‚Äôs thinner than I expected it would be, but still very warm and snuggly! The material is super soft and the light gray is very pretty. I am very happy with this comforter and would definitely recommend and/or purchase again!"
I like the softness and lightweight yet providing warmth.
I love duvet and it keeps me warm during winter. I love the ease of it and the functionality of the duvet. It‚Äôs pretty soft and you are getting the value for your money.
"I'll be leaving similar reviews on the same product in different sizing: but rest assured I'm a verified buyer. I've had it better than six weeks through all kinds of crazy weather. Honestly I was not sure about this purchase: I have purchased quilts that were advertised as cotton and came to me a sticky, sweaty, stifling (and frankly disappointing) polyester. I am spoiled by the 'grandmother's sheets"" concept: crisp and cozy, all-weather breathe-ability and comfort/quality is my focus.  I have wasted so much money in search of the right sleep combination. Easeland is now my most favorite company EVER!  I am just so pleased with their product and their honest marketing (that means a lot to me). This comforter is gorgeous, cozy, extremely well-made and just plain high quality. The stitching is fine and sturdy: it's fantastic to get a quilt that I know will not bunch-up or fall apart. There were a few loose strings here and there when I opened it, but I singed those off and they were tied off/stitched down so they didn't pull and unravel: just a by-product of manufacturing process. That was no issue. The quilt expanded nicely once un-packaged. Color is a dark smokey grey which I just love (I repainted my room around the color, I loved it so much). It's not wrinkly or clumpy. I live in Michigan, where in the the summer it could be 90 during the day and in the 30's at night, and well... you know we get cold in the winter. I really wanted a quilt that had a balanced, ""comforting"" and all weather weight, but that was not ""smothering"". Easeland delivered! Hallelujah! I purchased this twin for my son and we bought the oversized queen for our new beds: they fit well and the overhang was perfect. I will say that with the new foam mattress I am glad that I did go oversized. Combined with percale Bumble sheets, the whole setup is breathable and I really love the well-stitched loops for a duvet, which I will only purchase from this same company. I returned to school to obtain a graduate degree so my teen and twenty something kids agreed to a ""Christmas in July"" as I was finishing a hard curriculum. This was a great graduation present to myself and I will be purchasing these comforters as gift for my older girls who have their own households. I know they will be a hit! It's a humid, sticky July in Michigan right now and yet this all weather quilt is perfect. And I know it will handle our Michigan winters just fine. As someone who has been struggling under the c19 shutdown with little to spend, I was worried about spending the money on another bad buy. If you're worried about the price point for Easeland: don't be. This is a very quality product and actually a fantastic brand for what you'll pay. Questions? Bring em'."
"This quilt is as soft as promised. Very well made. And the price was good.  Nice that we didn‚Äôt have to wait long to have it delivered.  I ordered two quilts and put one on top of the other, to make a soft bed for someone who has sore joints.  It is working out great.  I would recommend this quilt ."
Nice and warm
"Super soft material, not thick but so warm. I bought the dark grey and it beautiful!Best purchase in a while."
Product is super warm and comfortable for the price bought 2 of them and would recommend for friends  and family to buy also
"Very nice quality, looks very nice on the bed. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s perfect year round. Warm enough for winter but lightweight enough for summer. Soft material and has not pilled at all. Fits our king sized bed perfect."
"So happy that I bought this comforter it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s soft. It fits my king size bed. Well, I love the color. It washes well in my washer keeps me warm even though I like to have a fan on in the winter. Very lightweight I would recommend this anyone"
1. I love all things purple.2. I bought this because of the color.3. I am very happy with this purchase.This comforter is very lightweight and comfy. The King size comforter covers my King size bed‚Äö√Ñ¬∂. But with little extra material. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lightweight and warm with what I consider a pretty shade of purple. The best part of this comforter is that I can throw it in the washer and dryer with ease.
"Seller very responsive, 1 day prime shipping service , great price and a very lovely material . Cozy and not heavy ‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t washed it yet , so for this reason I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t give it 5 star rating. No smell , perfect fit .Thinking about order up for king size next time, since I do like a bit of more covering on my queen size bed . Hubby approved as well . So far so good , get it while supplies and price last !"
"Purchased for Harley themed guest(grandkids) room in Queen. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a nice comforter set for the price, not too heavy but warm enough for SC winters. The fabric is nice and soft. The orange is very bright which I wanted and the black is a true black. I have not washed it yet so not sure how it will hold up in the wash yet. The bed is 23‚Äö√Ñ√π high with mattress and box spring at 17‚Äö√Ñ√π and the comforter just covers the frame. It works fine for this bed but you may want to size up if your bed/mattress is taller. Overall I love it , would definitely recommend"
"This is a great comforter for just about any season (except summer of course)!  Very good price (you get 2 pillow shams) and shipping was only a few days. Glad I waited for the sale,  but if you're looking for this print and color (grey),  it's a hit.  Reversible."
