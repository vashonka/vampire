I haven‚Äôt written a review before but this was such a great product I felt I had to.  Got it for my grandson for a project when he stayed with us.  We did it the first day hoping to see some of the grass grow.  The pictures above are 4 days after we planted things.  He has loved going to check on the progress each morning and water it.  It came with everything you need and I added 2 succulents we had at home.  It was easy for him to follow the directions and put things together with a little help.  Definitely worth purchasing for a Dino loving kid!
"Finally, a perfect birthday present for the nephew that we can have fun doing together without any screens involved! My nephew turned 5 and I always try to find something educational, no screens involved, and hands on that he would have fun with. He came over to my house and we built his terrarium together. It is so stinking cute and even has dinosaur figurines to add into the terrarium, which he extra appreciates as a fellow Dino lover!With the energy of a 5 year old, we were able to put this together in about an hour considering the time to let the dirt expand in the water. I can‚Äôt wait to hear about how his plants grow in his terrarium as the days go by. The seeds are chia and another easy to grow grass similar plant so guaranteed to see the plants grow. Imagine a chia pet concept level of ease! This comes with a light and everything you need, even a little mist bottle to water the plants. Just have to plug it in!He loves to get his hands in the dirt and I love teaching him about plants and hope to inspire him to be a future plant parent when he is older to match his auntie‚Äôs vibes. :)"
"This is a product perfect for kiddos who love dinosaurs and plants. They can easily assemble the science experiment and they‚Äôre on their way to growing greens. Pick your background, arrange your prehistoric lizard babies, and spritz with faucet water, you‚Äôll see seed growth in a snap.The grass outgrew our terrarium within a week and now, three months later, our gift givee‚Äôs mom is THREE MONTHS into the daily responsibility of watering the plants to keep them alive.10/10. Great for the classroom and great for the children of your enemies."
"I was looking for a fun activity with my 3 year old nephew currently obsessed with dinosaurs. We had a memorable time creating this terrarium together. He did add a lot more dinosaurs from his own collection, and loved waking up every morning to see the seeds growing. They grew fast!Note: every 3 year old is different, use best judgment when making this purchase for a child younger than the suggested age."
"This is such a fun thing to do with kids! They set it up how they like, no ‚Äúhard rules‚Äù and they get to watch it grow and  see the routes form in the soil"
So fun to set up. Was a gift for a 4 year old. She loved it.It grew SO much.Really great.
"Easy to assemble for a 6yr old. Just be careful not to pour too much water on the peat, pour it slowly.  Had to squeeze it dry but no big problem. Now waiting for the seeds to grow. My grandson is counting down the days.  Looks magical with the light turned on at night.He loves it !!"
My son got this for his birthday. He loved the process of putting it together and watching it grow. It quickly died and then he was over it.
Purchased for my grandson for Christmas and he loves watching things grow in the aquarium. Unfortunately he has lost everything to a house fire. Will may be buying it again.
"My granddaughters love this doll.  Perfect size for toddlers, such a soft doll.  Great gift idea."
"My 2 yr old‚Äôs eyes lit up when she saw this baby doll! üòç It is a smaller doll, but perfect for her little arms. She goes everywhere with us. The full plastic body is great for washing, and the accessories are perfect‚ÄîBlanket, bottle, binkie, and baba."
"My 2 year old granddaughter loves this doll, she loves that it came with a bottle and pacifier. This doll is very well made and the price was perfect. What I like about it you can purchase doll clothes for it because the clothes that came with the doll is removable."
This is a gift. This doll is so adorable and soft. Like the few extras.
Our toddler loves this doll. I chose it for the cute outfit and after reading other reviews I decided to throw away the paci and not give that to her for choking reasons. The baby clothes are soft and the little pink bow is adorable! There are cheaper options out there but it's a pretty good doll
My daughter loved this. So cute and very good quality
It is so much cuter than the images! It was so nostalgic to see actual socks on a doll again. Can't wait to see my granddaughters face when she opens it this Saturday. The blanket that comes with it is small though.
Purchased this for my one year old niece and it is perfect size for her compared to most baby dolls!
"The product itself is quite cute and a perfect size for little ones.  However, the doll is not soft in any way.  It is reasonably hard bodied.  I was looking for a soft body doll that could be used as a cuddle toy.  Perhaps I misread the description."
She was happy and the doll was sturdy and stunning worth the money and the color was beautiful
Great doll. It arrived fast. My daughter loves it
"Great gift for my daughters friends birthday.  Affordable, and arrived as pictured."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



No complaints. She‚Äôs a gorgeous doll. Two points of articulation being the shoulders and the hips. Does not come with a stand or comb/brush. I look forward to buying others."
Perfect
Cons:-Arms and legs do not bend-Sash/cover up does not go around her because it is too smallPros:-Really high quality for the price-Beautiful and exactly as advertised
My granddaughter loves these dolls. And I like there are so many to choose from‚Ä¶ although they remind me of Bratz dolls my daughter used to play with decades ago. But I guess everything comes around again & again. Great doll for the price.
"This line of Rainbow High dolls and theiraccessories are very well made. They are not jointed like most of the Rainbow High dolls, but I think that it is a good alternative and has a more sculptural quality."
Love rainbow high dolls they are made so well yes somewhat inappropriate in some eyes but yknow normalising is key this particular set they pretend they on holiday and do gymnastics they learn about what place they visit backing up with searching of holidays abroad connect with colours sometimes even mix the clothing to the doll even come up with weather situations ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs so sunny must wear suncream‚Äù imagination bargain price
"Me and my daughter were really impressed with the quality of this. Doll, it was not poorly made like some of them Aren't made with good plastic and poorly Put together this doll had really good quality Arms and legs were attached Solidly And head is well Axon doll for 3 years old and up"
My girl (age 5) loves her Chelsea doll and car! It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s cute and good quality. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve had it for almost a year and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s still brand new looking. Perfect gift!
It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a cute toy and just as expected. It has received a lot of play time and it was a good price.

This is a very cute Chelsea car! The stickers add a fun element to dress up the car. It's a two seater which I didn't know when I bought it, so two Chelsea dolls can fit, plus the dog if you sit it on her lap! If you have the Chelsea camper car, it seats one doll. The ribbon tail is cute. Only disappointment is the trunk doesn't open. Love it overall and a great addition to my daughter's Barbie Chelsea collection!"
Product looked good however these were purchased for family we adopted for Christmas.
This car is the cutest little thing my 21 month old granddaughter just loves it. All the parts are secure. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s safe and very much fun for them. I highly recommend this.
"This set is so cute, the car actually rolls which is great, The stickers are super cute and the car has been decorated a bit in the pictures. This doll is also able to stand up on her own which is an added feature I didn't know about, I didn't think Barbie toys could do that The only problem I have so far is when I removed her sunglassed so her hair could be restyled, I noticed a spot where no hair is threaded, and she's bald there which was unfortunate. You can style her hair to cover this kind of but that was disappointing and I recommend leaving the sunglasses where they are to avoid some of that. Also again with the hair, I noticed she had a tiny section of her layered hairdo that didn't quite work (a bit too long) but it was a tiny section that I was able to easily trim off. I like the layered look of her hair but some people might not. Overall I'd say she is very functional for what she is. Her shirt is actually a one-piece bathing suit painted/molded to her so only the skirt is removable but that's quite nice actually because it gives her two separate outfits. Overall for $13.99, I'd say she's great for the price point because she comes with he car and the puppy, and the stickers as well."
"My neice loved it, price wasn't bad. Seemed sturdy. She was happy."
"Like, Christmas present"
This will be a treasured Christmas for my grand daughter.
It is of good quality.
4 year old granddaughter loves the doll. Good size for her.
"My little 2 year old loves this little set. The baby and carrier are pretty small, I expected bigger but it‚Äôs actually good because my toddler can carry it easier. Nice quality, high end looking and soft. She carries this baby everywhere!"
My niece loved this baby and carrier which was perfect for her little hands!Good accessories for her to keep busy with.
My 2-year-old granddaughter loves the doll. It has a hard body.  Now I need to find doll clothes for it.
i got this doll for my one year old. it‚Äôs her first doll. she really likes it. she brings it everywhere and it‚Äôs easy to clean and sturdy. i would purchase it again
So soft and perfect size for little ones!
"My little girl Loves this doll with pacifier & loves covering with blanket in ""bed"". Great gift."
My 3 yr old granddaughter was super happy with her gift
"This doll is adorable and looks like a real baby. She‚Äôs not made of hard plastic which makes her very comfortable to hold. I bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday and she loves this doll! It has drawn the attention of other adults, thinking that she is holding a real baby! They are interested in purchasing this doll for their child!"
Grand Daughter gift.  This stole the party!  There was nothing that caught her attention like this beautiful baby girl.  Thank you !!  Great product.

I thought it was a good price for this doll. It‚Äôs the perfect weight for my 5 year old. Not super heavy like some other dolls. Limbs are a little hard to move but not bad. The doll isn‚Äôt creepy looking like others I have gotten in the past! Cute face and great size! Hand feet and lines on arms and legs are perfect!"
"She‚Äôs so beautiful I‚Äôm crying! I wish her hair wasn‚Äôt painted on, but it‚Äôs okay. I wanted a more realistic reborn doll, but the prices are out of my range. I am satisfied."
"The doll looks like the picture but the body of the doll is not vinyl. Just the face, arms and legs.  It‚Äôs a cute doll."
Omg this baby doll os just perfect  every one thinks it real.  My 3yr old loves it.
My daughter loved this baby. Dislike that the legs don't move.
"I was quite impressed how real this doll looks and came with baby bottles, soothers, diaper and hospital ankle ID! I‚Äôm sure my 2 yr old granddaughter will love it for Christmas!"
"I thought this reborn doll would be just like the others by this same brand, with an anatomically correct body, but the body is cloth. For the same price as the other ones I don‚Äôt understand why there wouldn‚Äôt be some sort of indication in this listing about the body type. Very disappointed as my daughter wanted this doll to be able to give baths and play with as a real baby."
"This doll surpassed my expectations! As we all (should) know, REAL reborns are A LOT more expensive & hand made. So I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything close. But this baby‚Äôs details, softness & realistic face & body comes close! This was definitely worth the money. I recommend especially if you want to get a ‚Äúreborn‚Äù for your toddler or just start your collection."
This was a birthday gift for my friends daughter. The doll is super cute! Came with a bottle 2 little rattle toys and a magnetic pacifier.
"They look so real. Awesome, was happy."
It is so cute and my family will be sending me pictures as she opens them.  WIll update when I hear what she has to say.  Her name is also Skylar and her facial expression is so simular to her.
Bought this for my 8 yr old niece who is very active. She brought this baby with her everywhere except school for almost a year and it‚Äôs still going strong!
I loved the doll. She came right on time. She is absolutely beautiful! I was disappointed her name from the description was not anywhere on the box or literature. There was a blank birth certificate that I was able to pen her name in. She will be loved by my granddaughter. üíñ
"My daughter loved this so much. It so very nice quality, and the accessories were a great!"
"We ordered 2 of these dolls.  One for each of our youngest Granddaughters.  It‚Äôs almost scary how lifelike these dolls are.  Other than being slightly smaller than a real baby, which is perfect, because they are just the right size for a 6 and 8 year old, they really look like newborn babies.  Be warned they are very accurate.  In other words, they are anatomically correct which kind of surprised my wife üòäI‚Äôm far from being a doll expert, but they appear to be very well made and durable.  So far they have survived a few temper tantrums unscathed.The Girls absolutely love them.  They carry them around and treat them like real babies.  I‚Äôm really glad to see them playing with something that stimulates their imaginations as opposed to being on an iPad all day.Yeah, they cost a little more than the run-of-the-mill big box toy dolls, but they are definitely worth it."
"I am very disappointed with this doll. No soft feel with this hard plastic doll, especially for the amount of money I have spent."
"My daughter will love this at Christmas, fast delivery to the uk will definitely order again :)"

So realistic when it cries and it really does walk and crawl !"
We love this brand feels like real baby !!
"I ordered this baby doll for my 4 year old niece.  One of the eyes does not close by itself, which upsets her.  She will not let loose of the doll long enough to return it.  Any suggestionsBroke"
"This is a very cute doll for little one ! I bought this doll for my granddaughter, for her 3 years birthday and she love it very much! Thanks a lot !"
"my daughter loves doctors , and she loves Barbie‚Äôs even more so this was a perfect toy to just buy for her ! she‚Äôs 3 and i found it perfect for her age range she did good with the small pieces as well"
