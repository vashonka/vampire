This is a cute set. I can wear it casually or dress up.
Very poor qualityy
Looks like the photo. Beautiful sterling for a very reasonable price. It‚Äôs delicate but still has definition and craftwork. Did not come boxed. Strong lobster clasp.
"I‚Äôve worn this bracelet every day,  all day for the last month, except during an X-ray, I‚Äôve not removed it.  I don‚Äôt always have the best luck with inexpensive jewelry.  No discoloration. As shiny as the day it arrived.  This bracelet has accompanied me to the gym, sauna, shower and bed.  I‚Äôve not removed it to clean my home‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs an incredible bargain with a rich look and feel.  Plus‚Ä¶ it looks as good as the day it arrived.  No discoloration.  It was a perfect addition to my everyday wear, it‚Äôs light weight, and looks  like a fine piece of jewelry!  Very pleased.  I‚Äôd be happy to receive it as a gift, and would purchase again."
Length was perfect and the bracelet was very shiny. I love the width and that it was slightly flat. Very nice lobster claw clasp makes me feel that the bracelet is secure.
This bracelet is simple and rather light weight.  The silver tone is whitish rather than a high reflective silver tone surface.  It will be fine for my infrequent use.
I love this bracelet. It's great for dressy occasions as well as every day wear. Well-made and seems quite durable as well.
"It was beautiful, well made , and looked more expensive than it was would recommend it for the Christmas holidays coming up‚Ä¶!!!"
Looks nice. Giving as a gift.
I love this bracelet and the price is right but I have to keep replacing it because it always breaks
"Bought for a relative who loved the look of it. They were very pleased at the craftsmanship. Clasp seems very sturdy, though it may be a challenge to open it one handed as the clasp mechanism is on the tight side. Has a brilliant shine. I am thanked often for gifting it by my relative :)"
This bracelet is very sweet and pretty a bit narrower than I would have liked but I didn‚Äôt see a wider one.
I wear it every day I would recommend it to anyone
Some of the best grade silver ever worn.
"I purchased a pair of daisy earrings and wanted a matching necklace. This necklace is perfect, great value for the money, durable, dainty and very feminine. It compliments any outfit. It is a gold chain with pearl like daisy petals."
This is a Christmas gift for a 9 year old who is very fashion conscious.  It is lovely- delicate looking and feminine- yet appears to be of good quality.  I think she is going to LOVE it!
"I had very low hopes, with how low the price was. I was very mistaken. I have had this necklace for a month now and no tarnish no breaking. Very nice and simple to go with everything."
Although this necklace was quite beautiful and unique as well as sturdy chain...the pearls were damaged when I wore it for 2 days in a little water.  They appear to gave a layer of pearlized paint on them that was turning pink from my outfit and peeling off. I had to throw it out bc I couldn't salvage it....Update: They are sending me another and want to make it right. They are very attentive and helpful with customer care.
Lovely design but the materials are terrible. The gold finish turns brown quickly. Latch failed. Had to throw it away after just a couple wears. Would love to buy a real gold form of this design.
Delicate & beautiful necklace. Comfortable to wear.
Just what I wanted and it looks great!
This necklace and earrings are delicate and dainty perfect for my 97-year-old mother who absolutely loves them!!!
I am very pleased with this necklace.  Very complimentary to my gold necklace I wear.  I wear it like a loose choker.  I have received so many compliments on it.  Very good value!
Nice n light necklace
"This is my second time buying this bracelet. The first time lasted five years through heavy wear, including traveling and overnight use. It’s a great piece for every day wear - not too fancy but just enough to dress up any outfit. Cute even at the gym. Buy it on sale and have a great piece for many years!"
Impressed with the quality for the price. Looks very nice for the price. The crystal stones look good. If you’re looking for a tennis bracelet under $100 hard to imagine a better deal than this.
It so sparkly! I know my granddaughter will love it!
I bought this braclet as a birthday gift for my sister. She said it beautiful. She likes the way it sparkles when the light shine on it. She said she loves it.
I bought the blue one but I got an orange one. My wife loves it but blue one looks better
Stunning sparkles I got compliments on the time and love the touch of the Swarovski crystals at the very bottom of the tassels and absolutely love the comfort of the bubble settings and worth every penny absolutely love it can't go wrong with Swarovski and purchased the double strand bracelet for my future daughter-in-law and I'm getting ready to purchase another bracelet for myself in silver or white gold I haven't decided but once again it's Swarovski and absolutely gorgeous zero complaints and all of my crystals are intact and are absolutely gorgeous
"I bought this as a gift for my sister. The product is beautiful, and the extra links came in handy to adjust the length appropriately."
I love the color and the ball clasp.
Easy to size and looks beautiful. Bought it for my wife and she really likes it. Well made and will last for a long time.
I’ve bought it for my granddaughters 18th and isn’t till Christmas so I’m hoping that it will fit as it looks on the small side but it looks like good quality one
The quality of this bracelet is unbelievable!! It’s gorgeous and fits great; easy to put on by myself. It was delivered on time when it was expected. The price was excellent. I would definitely recommend this product!
"I was surprised by the quality of this bracelet, very nice."
Purchased because the reviews were good but still did not expect much . It arrived and it is beautiful not too shiny or dull. It looks much more high end than the price would suggest. I am buying additional ones for my sisters.
"This bracelet when stretched out is 7 inches, but let the ends go and it shrinks back to less than 6 inches.  It is pretty tho."
"I like the fit, looks and it is NOT the real yellow gold that looks fake."
"I never write reviews on Amazon, but felt the need to do so for this product. Worth every dollar. I shower with it every day and no, it is has not changed color. It's so comfortable you can't even feel it on your arm. I received a lot of compliments on it. Amazing quality."
"This bracelet is so cute, I got so so many compliments on it while I had it on. It's a bit more yellow gold than I was expecting but it grew on me. I'm not a huge jewelry person but i want to wear more, just dont want to break the bank so this was a perfect first bracelet purchase to get going on a wrist stack.  I iked it so much, I repurchased another with no problem after my first one was damaged:My first one lasted me about a month before I had to remove it. I'll admit it's my fault for wearing it while moving into my new house which involved carrying lots of heavy, wooden furniturem however I dont think a quality piece of jewelry wouldve been ruined this easy. After a day of manual labor, the bracelet's chain link had little pieces of the links that were ripped out and would stick out, puncture my wrist, scratch me and get caught on my clothes and rip out threads."
"Great item! No tarnish, light weight, and pretty! I wear this all day everyday, even in the shower. I forget I’m wearing this bracelet because it is very light weight. Recommended. I love it!"
I like this item  . Comfortable.
It was lovely but way to small.  Had to return it
Really lovely bracelet not lost it’s colour great value for money
Perfect size for me and a pleasure to wear. I bought a pair.

"I love! I wear it almost everyday. I had it for about a year or two now still hasn’t tarnished, just like new. Seller is also really sweet."
I was very impressed with the quality of this necklace for the price such a beautiful necklace and it arrived early
i wear necklaces with dedication AKA i never take them off 😂😂 but so far it’s still shiny. unfortunately though with thin writing in jewelry the quality is a little cheap and it will bend so wear with caution. other than that it’s been wonderful
I wish the clasp links were a bit larger. So tiny? Would be easier to attach if links a bit larger
"I got this for my friend who had a new baby very early and her daughter is stuck in the NICU for months. Shes absolutely in love with it. She said she cried when she got it. It’s the perfect gift. I got 18 inches and she said it’s a great size. I ended up ordering another one for my sister who just had a new baby too! Who dosent want to carry their cute babies name around! Material, and fit looks beautiful! Reasonable price too! Perfect perfect gift! Also shipping did not take too long!"
"I'll be sure to take a photo and add it in the future.I wanted a Script Name necklace with a certain scale (Small/Medium, not ""Too Large"" in my mind). This was perfect. And yes, I wanted it in ""Gold.""The fit, font, and scale have all be exactly what I wanted. I wanted it close to my color bone but not a choker. This is mildly adjustable, so that's a nice feature.I've had other ""Gold"" necklaces which were very pretty, and the ""Gold"" was all washed off in a matter of months. It's been around 6 months of wearing it at least a few times a week. And so far, it has lasted and still looks great!I am very happy with it and will use it again in the future for Gift Giving to women on my Team for Recognition gifts!Definitely recommend!"
Love it. Readable. Good quality. Shiny. No skin irritation. Easy to use. Weight is good.
This necklace is very dainty and pretty
"I purchased this as a gift for my 17 year old sister and she LOVED it. I saw it for the first time on my 15 year old daughters Amazon Christmas wish list. Now that I've seen it in person I'll be ordering one for my daughter as well. It's dainty, long and the color is so pretty. Love Kendra Scott. My daughter owns about 5 of these brands and they are all very pretty, durable, and affordable. I think it makes the perfect gift for a teenage girl."
"This was a gift for a teen. She loved it. Good quality, fit nicely, and good value."
The photos of what I ordered had more of a dusty pink color for the stone whereas the necklace I received is bright white. It’s still a pretty necklace though
Kendra Scott jewelry is just  gorgeous . I have a couple pieces and having a hard time picking out my next piece because I want them all.
"I recently purchased the Kendra Scott Nola Pendant Necklace as a gift for my daughter-in-law, and I couldn't be more pleased with the result! This necklace is a stunning, dainty piece of jewelry that is perfect for adding a touch of elegance to any outfit.The design is unique and timeless, with a delicate pendant that catches the light beautifully. It’s versatile enough to wear every day, but it also has enough charm to make a statement for special occasions. The quality is excellent, with the craftsmanship clearly reflecting the brand's reputation for fine jewelry.My daughter-in-law absolutely loved it! She was so excited to receive such a thoughtful and stylish gift, and it suited her perfectly. It’s the kind of piece that can be worn with anything from casual to more formal attire, making it a great addition to any jewelry collection.Overall, I highly recommend the Kendra Scott Nola Pendant Necklace. Whether as a gift or for yourself, it's a beautiful, dainty, and unique piece of jewelry that is sure to impress!"
Upon opening the box I just lit up!!! It is so pretty. It’s the perfect size for me. Swarovski makes this bracelet in this smaller petite size as well as a larger bolder statement bracelet. This size looks like real diamonds at a glancing distance. It is sparkly and eye catching without being gaudy. My wrist measures 5.5” so this fits nice without the extra extender on. Mine did come with a box as well. It feels expensive and solid. I am very happy with it. My review is solely based on my first impression right out of the box. I will update if any issues arise.
It looks according to its picture it is shiny and brilliant
"My bracelet broke the week of my daughter's wedding. leaving me no time to fix it. We purchased this one and it held up through all the festivities and parties and is still going strong after being worn multiple times. It's gorgeous, stays shiny, and the clasp is strong. Thank You Swarvosky!"
It’s beautiful and I received a lot of compliments.
The bracelet broke in less than 6 months. This is when I wore it only occasionally. Bad quality and will never buy again.
I would call this a peacemaker!
"This beautiful bracelet is made by Swarovski. Swarovski sterling silver with small crystals. Elegant yet durable and easy on and off. You can buy the matching necklace and earrings separately.  Made very well, definitely giftable."
"Great product, we bought as a gift for someone and they absolutely love it."
This helps me keep track of jewelry I wear daily but also it is easy to fill for traveling. Beautiful case and it is very sturdy and not easily crushed.
"I needed a travel jewelry box because my mom passed away and I traveled out of state in a hurry not knowing that would happen.I needed something to keep her jewelry I wanted, and keep it safe traveling back home. It was perfect and came quick for the time frame I needed it. It came in both our favorite color and everything I saved fit perfect for travel."
