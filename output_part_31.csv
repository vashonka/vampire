Each scent is unique and vibrant, offering a wide range of options to suit different moods and occasions. My personal favorites are the Vanilla and Mango, both of which have a warm and inviting aroma.### Quality of the OilsThe quality of these oils is impressive. They are highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way. Just a few drops in my diffuser fill the room with a rich and lasting fragrance. The scents are not overpowering, but rather provide a pleasant and soothing ambiance.### Packaging and PresentationThe oils come in a well-organized box, making it easy to store and access each bottle. The packaging is also attractive, making this set an excellent gift option for friends and family, especially during the holidays.### VersatilityThese oils are not just for diffusers.

It offers great value for the price and adds a delightful touch to my home. Whether you're looking to treat yourself or give a thoughtful gift, this set is a wonderful choice.Highly recommended for anyone who loves high-quality fragrance oils!"
"Sorry for the long review, lol, just wanted to be as detailed as possible.I’m giving this product 4 stars because despite the downsides, it was relatively cheap. I think you more or less get what you pay for with these.For the record, I got these scents for slime and potentially soap making, and for my infuser though I haven’t used them for soap making yet.Upsides:- You get a lot of different scents for the price (though do note that each bottle is fairly small)- Some of the scents are clear which is always nice, some are brown but that shouldn’t be a problem unless you get it on clothing or plan to use it in a clear slime or soap.- Seller is very helpful. Like I say in the downsides, the packaging isn’t great, but the seller responded within 48 hours and offered to replace the broken bottles and a sincere apology.- The essential oils did not cause any skin sensitivity, even when I accidentally got some directly on my hands.- I am prone to migraines, especially with scents. Just a tiny whiff of perfume can cause me to have a major headache. None of these scents caused me any issues. Good if you’re sensitive to certain scents or perfumes.- Most don’t smell bad when mixed.- It doesn’t all pour out at once.Downsides:- Packaging isn’t great. 1 bottle broke in shipping, the other leaked. The one that broke was brown, so it did stain my bathroom rug (I tend to make slime in my shower for easy clean up), but that’s not a huge deal because it’s $20. Be careful when opening your box and don’t open it around stainable stuff. Seller was responsive and offered to replace the broken bottles. When they sent the replacement, all bottles did come intact.- You need to use a lot of oil to be able to scent stuff, or at least slime in my case. The stronger scents (like blueberry muffin) took about 1/8th of the bottle to scent a 10 ounce slime (no clay, just a basic slime), but the weaker scents (like cotton candy) barely scented anything at all. Another 10 ounce slime required almost the entire bottle and even that only gave it an almost undetectable smell. It more just masked the glue-type smell slimes typically have before scent is added in.- The scent labels aren’t always exactly accurate.- The website on the box and slime bottles is inaccessible.- So, so, so hard to get the oils out of the bottles. Requires a lot of shaking and banging, which kind of splatters it everywhere (the bottles are already very small, so every drop is precious). The drops don’t really coke out very evenly. This would certainly make it hard to measure if you’re trying to create an exact recipe that you want to be able to replicate in the future.Favorite scent:Blueberry muffinAccuracy: smells more like a blue raspberry type scentStrength: strongest for sure, but stillPleasantness: loved the smell, simply perfectOther scents included:Cotton candyAccuracy: Honestly hard to tell because of how weak it is, but I think it’s fairly accurate?Strength: Insanely weak. Used almost the full bottle on a 10 ounce slime and could barely detect the scent.Pleasantness: Smells good from what I can tell but again, hard to determine due to how weak it is.StrawberryAccuracy: Smells more like strawberry frostingStrength: you definitely need to use a lot, but it’s not as weak as cotton candyPleasantness: I personally loved it, but I also love the smell of strawberry icing. It may be too sweet for some people.BrownieAccuracy: not at all accurate, just vaguely resembles the smell of cocoStrength: very strongPleasantness: This one smelled the worst, I actually threw it away. It smelled like how that chocolate protein powder made from peas tastes. It’s like if you took all of the sugar out of a chocolate bar.French VanillaAccuracy: Smells exactly like vanilla extractStrength: fairly weakPleasantness: smells pretty good, like I said, just like vanilla extract.MarshmallowAccuracy: absolutely no idea, could barely smell itStrength: super duper weakPleasantness: I guess it smells good? Can barely smell it.Sugar cookieAccuracy: Smells just like sugar cookiesStrength: Fairly week like most other scents, but not *too* badPleasantness: Great, very sugary.CoconutAccuracy: smells like coconut oilStrength: so so, about as strong as the other products.Pleasantness: I’m not a good judge in this as I don’t like the smell of coconut.Apple PieAccuracy: smells like a sweeter version of the harvest spicesStrength: a bit stronger than most of the others, but not as strong as the blueberry muffinPleasantness: very niceHarvest SpiceAccuracy: Smells like what you’d expectStrength: a bit stronger than the apple piePleasantness: Also very nice"
"My oils arrived yesterday. They were wrapped really well and securely to protect the glass bottles themselves. However, similar to many other reviews, the bottles had leaked all over the inside and the bottles weren't full (likely as a result of the leaking). I opened each bottle and tested them to find that not all of the droppers worked either. Specifically, I had to entirely remove 1 dropper from the bottle to get the product out.Regarding the product themselves, they smell heavenly. I use floral scented oils for homemade carpet powder/upholstery refresher and on wool dryer balls. These are potent and upon making carpet powder, made my entire finished basement smell as if I had walked into a fresh flower shop.When considering whether or not I'd repurchase, I think I probably would try another brand first to see if they arrived with less leakage but overall, not a horrible product."
I love them they smell so good in my diffuser's I use them in my wax in my carpet shampooer also it's great gift I can't wait to get more
Nice smells but sadly leaking when arrived so missing some liquid and a mess instead
Came well packaged - however one had slightly leaked in transit.
The media could not be loaded.
"I was looking for scents to add to my candles and thought these would be perfect as candle making was mentioned in the features. Sadly, although they smell 🤤 incredible, there is no scent throw in the wax. I'll be giving them away as gifts to friends with diffusers."
"5/5 RatingThis is one of the only scents that just about every women who smelled it loves it. I got this for my diffuser to liven up my place, a friend came over and smelled it, she LOVED it. I used at my Dad's place one time and everyone seemed to love it there as well.  Even bout it for a friend and his lounge, it was a hit there as well.Do yourself a favor and get it.ProsSmells GreatComes in large bottleHas an earthy Masculine scentConsA little pricey"
I love the smell of wanderlust it have your home smelling good when you come in.
"I bought the midnight and it smells amazing. However there is no dropper or dispenser on the bottle. A little bit goes a long way, so it’s difficult to pour into a diffuser without making a mess."
"I have bought these multiple times why because the value for my money is there,The smell is good, and it lasts a long time."
Got this for my hubby to use in a waterless diffuser in  his truck. works great and smells fantastic has that smell that men love he usually like the ice smell but this is better.
Haven’t used yet but because the box came with the contents leaking inside it I can certainly smell. It does smell great just sad it leaked.
What I liked about the product is that you receive a lot versus the other brands. What I don’t like is that the smell of the scent is very very very mild. I can barely smell it compared to the original scent. I do understand this is a dupe but it needs to be stronger in my opinion. But I guess I get what I pay for.
"i love this fragrance and how it lingers . It’s a nice elegant smell . The only drawback back is that it didn’t come with a dropper or dropper cap , so when you pour some into diffuser a lot can come out . That’s why I gave it 4 stars"
"I don’t know if you’re like me and love the smell of cedar if you do you will not be disappointed in this oil.Product packaging is fantastic oil comes in a tinted glass bottle with a reusable lid and a glass dropper. I love that the glass is tinted because this adds longevity to the oil. Oil is priced well for a 4oz bottle I have spent much more on a bottle of 4oz oil in the past not to mention that other brands will provide plastic droppers or bottles or once you remove the original cap you cannot use them again and are stuck using the dropper as the lid.Sent is amazing and fresh no rancid smelling oil. The smell of cedar is one of those smells that brings so many memories of my childhood and father and this one had the memories rushing back as soon as I opened it and got the first smell of the oil. Sent is long lasting and even after 16 hours I could still smell it on the items I have sprayed it on.I plan on making a variety of different DIY projects with this oil I have already made a spray for my dogs with homemade rose water and adding a few drops of the oil to my spray for them. I love the fact that adding the cedar oil to the spray helps with deterring bugs while also making their coats soft and smell amazing, and not having to use the chemically created sprays that are offered for sale currently. Not to mention that I can make a ton of spray from this one bottle and with the perfumed dog spray costing so much I am going to save a ton of money making my own spray for them. I have plans to use the oil for various other things like my oil warmer for a affordable room sent, in my drawers for moth prevention and also adding a wonderful sent to my clothes, candle making and anything else I can dream up the list of things I will be using the oil for is a long one. And you won’t be disappointed with the smell because it smells amazing! I will definitely be purchasing it again in the future and I cannot wait to try some of the other oils from this brand and seller."
"I recently started using thyme essential oil, and I am thoroughly impressed! The quality of this oil is outstanding, and it has quickly become a staple in my wellness routine.First and foremost, the aroma is absolutely delightful—earthy and herbal, it’s perfect for aromatherapy. I love diffusing it in my living space; it creates a calming atmosphere while also helping to clear my sinuses during cold seasons. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in my respiratory comfort when I use it, especially during allergy season.I also appreciate its versatility. I’ve used thyme essential oil in my homemade cleaning products, and it adds a fresh scent while providing antimicrobial benefits. Plus, it’s been fantastic for my digestive health. A few diluted drops in warm water after meals have helped with bloating and discomfort.What I love most is that it’s safe to use topically when diluted properly. I’ve applied it to minor cuts and bruises, and it seems to speed up the healing process while reducing inflammation.Overall, I highly recommend thyme essential oil for anyone looking to enhance their health and wellness naturally. It’s effective, multipurpose, and has a wonderful scent—definitely a five-star product!"
Grapefruit is one of the freshest clean smelling essential oil fragrances.  I use this product in the household cleaners and laundry products I make at home.  This is a great product for a low price.
I have to start off by saying the packaging of this product is beautiful. There’s a glass dropper that goes with the bottle and it’s well protected inside the packaging. You can tell there is love in this company. The only reason I’m giving it a 4 star is because it’s fragrance is not like an actual Vanilla like I was hoping. It was a little too “perfumy” if that makes sense. I wish this brand would have a vanilla bean scent!
"It smells like black licorice, which I am not a fan of, but it added the scent I needed to achieve the new scent, if that makes sense."
"I honestly don’t know what sandalwood is supposed to smell like. I have never bent down to gently inhale the aroma from a sandalwood in nature. Until 2 minutes ago I had no idea what the source was other than a vague notion it was likely a plant of some sort. This product is an entirely accurate representation of what I believe to be sandalwood fragrance. Seriously, it smells good, no weird sweaty sock undertones or whatever it is that makes some smell like a hospital version of your favorite childhood food. The fragrance lasts. If one were to, for example, drop the entire bottle on the bathroom floor, you would not be disappointed with how quickly the smell disappeared. Obviously a completely ’out of the blue, nobody is that clumsy’ scenario I made up."
Wanted to try out a new fragrance for my candles and thought the combo would smell nice. Before I took the stopper out the scent was really strong but as soon as I took the stopper out the scent died down big time. I had to use more than I do for other fragrances just to smell something. I wouldn’t buy this scent again.
"Ordered to refresh my cinnamon broom - i didn’t care for the scent. To me it smelled like a wet cinnabon, but i prefer a really offensively strong scent of essential oils. My husband threw out my broom because he said it “went bad.” However, i regifted the remaining amount to my mom who LOVED IT, so tastes vary!"
You really can't go wrong with the Spearmint Oil. It is top-shelf AAAA quality. Its scent is extremely pleasant and potent without being overpowering. I have to believe this is the best quality that can be achieved. Top marks to PHATOIL! *****/5
"This is the second bottle of PHATOIL peppermint oil I have bought from this company.  We have 2 very large raised beds that stand on pavers to stop them rotting in our back garden and unfortunately last year a rat moved in under a bed and made a nest.  We tried everything to get rid of the rat, which of course became more than one but nothing worked. I had heard that they don’t like mint so bought the peppermint oil to spray under the raised beds, it worked. We didn’t have critters digging up my potato’s, or eating my strawberry’s and tomato this year. However our dogs have become very agitated around the raised beds again which means another critter has moved in so it’s time to spray peppermint oil under and behind the beds again, hopefully with the same success.  It also smells nice in the burner."
Large bottle for the price. Happy
"Lovely product. Bought for my daughter who had a rat in her attic. They hate peppermint smell. Put peppermint oils on cotton wool and place in attic, yes it helped to send him off."
"Beautiful presentation of this item upon arrival, it was wrapped so no mess could happen (great care taken). I bought this to go in my waterless diffuser and in reed diffuser for my bathroom. I think it's a lovely sent and reminds me of the Yara fragrance by Laffata Perfumes from the UAE. Long lasting and it works perfectly with my reed diffuser. I also purchased Secret and omgosh it's heavenly. I put that sent in a reed diffuser for my 18yro bathroom. She wanted to dip her fingers in it and apply it directly to her neck lol. I think whatever sent you buy will deliver exactly what you expect. 100% recommend"
"I have been struggling, trying to find the right scent for my home. I finally tried the “The Magic Scent” “Secret”. This is absolutely my favorite scent out of everything I have tried. I’m now purchasing several of the other scents from this line and redoing my whole house. AMAZING"
"I loved this!  Came fast! The scent last & is very powerful. I haven’t used my diffusers in a few days, and when I walk in, the whole house is still illuminating with the smell… I’m definitely ordering again!"
"Mahogany and Teakwood is my favorite, but all of them smell great! This is my favorite brand to use in my diffusers!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I got the bamboo scent and although I haven’t been to the Four Seasons in Bora Bora, I would imagine that this would smell just like it as it is elegant and high class. I like strong smells and this is something I would recommend if you like them as well. The scent last and fills the room in about 10 minutes. With the diffuser off, I would still smell the scent which is a plus. For me, it’s not overwhelming and doesn’t cause any headaches. I use a rechargeable waterless diffuser. I use the diffuser between my car and bedroom. I also used Hotel Collections in the past for my go to but now with The Magic Scent, I have a new array of scents to choose from. So far, excellent product and company. I would say that it would be nice to have a sample size of each scent so I would be able to smell others before committed to purchasing a full size bottle. The price isn’t an issue as long as quality is there, I would purchase again. Thanks."
Great product!  Would purchase again for sure!
Excellent!!!!! Love this scent!!!! It’s great
"Smells incredible! Wonderful whole house scent, love coming home too!"
"I recently tried this air freshener, and I have to say, the scent is reminiscent of a fresh cologne, which I absolutely love. It adds a sophisticated touch to my space. One thing I appreciated was having to turn the warmer down a couple of notches compared to other brands I've used. This adjustment helps the fragrance last longer, making it more cost-effective in the long run. Overall, a great product that strikes the perfect balance between scent strength and longevity!"
That has been our scent for a while and we always get compliments when we have friends over. It’s a great value since it last long. We also never had any problems with leaking. It’s great!
"I was using lavender with White Flowers and just loved how it smelled out of the package and in the diffuser. But it did not last as long and the aroma intensity waned during it's 2 week life span. In comparing this new Lavender with Waterlilies, I was initially unimpressed. However, in the new diffusers, the fragrance has grown on me and it is lasting longer. It is stronger than the White Flowers off the bat, but it's aroma stays at the same potency day after day. The AC picks up the scent and I get gentle whiffs throughout the house. The mightier aroma of the Waterlilies is a high fly home run in the Laundry area and the Bathroom.Two weeks later, the scent seems normal, it overpowers dirty socks in the hamper, the bottle is still three  fifths full (lowest setting).And, I periodically get a faint trace of the fragrance as I go through the house.I actually bought separately a 5 pack of the the fragrance and a 4 pack of the New Diffusers.There is bundle with both that is just easier to order.Give the fragrance a week, because if you have been using a dainty scent it may seem strong initially.The New Advanced Scent Warmers with this new Lavender with Waterlilies are beautifully lit and easier to use and my refill is lasting longer. The new Advanced Scent Warmers can be bought by themselves or with a bundle, but they are So worth the 16 dollars for a Four pack."
Lasts a longwhile - vibrant and strong scent. Great value and cute decor
"First time purchasing eucalyptus & wild berries scent. I love it! My one & only complaint is that one of the bottles is empty. After opening the box it was shipped in i could smell the scent. The inside of the box was not wet but the pkg the refills come in was opened at the bottom and that was wet. I haven't taken the bottles out of its pkg yet. I don't understand how that could've been missed. For what i see, lt was already like this, the packers didn't care and just sent it to the customer which happens to be me. Packers need to pay more attention."
"The product was not expensive. The smell iris like being at a spa.The functionality of the product worked well; i did not experience any leakage, and the longevity of the product is worth having. I had my warmers for two years and they still are working till this day. They omitt beautiful scents. I really enjoy this scent and intend to purchase again."
"I have received so many compliments from people who enter my home. They are functional, don’t leak, easy to use and provide a great scent. They are a good value for the price."
I lovvve this air wick flavor! I have two teenage boys and it has worked great for their rooms! I will continue to use this fragrance especially for their rooms!
Great scent
"So I got this for my car air freshener - it's a little black thing that has a wooden round disc inside and when the sun hits it, it spins really fast dispensing the smell. And after a few months of having it, the wood disc doesn't smell anymore so I figured I would just soak the disk in the oil - and it works! I love this scent, it smells like a.... man. Idk how else to describe it. I'm a fan of Black Ice - so it's similar but not the same."
I‚Äôve been using essential oils instead of fabric softener for a while now and this is by far the most fragrant one I‚Äôve had! Makes my laundry smell so clean and fresh!!
I love this essential oil. It actually smells like linen! I ordered 4 different oils all marketed as linen essential oil. I kept this one and returned the others. Very happy with my purchase and just ordered another bottle. Highly recommend.
Smells good and lasts long. Find a small piece of wood and squirt the oil all over it. Throw the piece of wood under a seat in your car. Long lasting smell good.
It was wrapped in a loose bubble bag. 1/3 of the liquid was leaked. Some nice this is not a prime purchase I did not have time to return it so I kept it. Smell is good . But I am gonna look for the better option on my next purchase
This smells great in my diffuser
This is a great product to put Into your ac filter to make your home smell fantastic!
Great aroma at laundry time with this scent on my wool drying balls.
"Great product and customers love this fragrance! I use this product in my handmade bath and body business to make bath bombs, body oils, sprays, and salt scrubs/soaks. This is a very good neutral fragrance for customer's especially if they are purchasing something for someone else. It has a creamy honey, coconut and almond scent as the title says and it doesn't disappoint. I will continue to order from this company and have ordered 20 fragrances from them thus far and they all are of high quality and this company does a really good job explaining the fragrance as a whole and I have yet to find one that doesn't match what they say - I highly recommend this company. Their products come in glass bottles which I really like and they hold the fragrance really well in all of my products - each medium will hold a different level of scent and a different portion of the scent - so my body oils you can smell the entire fragrance; where as my salt scrubs and soaks have stronger notes of the honey and my bath bombs have a stronger creamy almond smell so it just depends on what medium you use for your product. Overall, fantastic product and will continue to order from this company."
"I figured this oil was going  to have a strong cedar scent, but its actually not that strong, you can smell it, but mixed with the leather scent it muted it a bit...Definitely balanced well!  I definitely plan to buy more when I run out"
I use this to make my own body spray. It smells amazing and the scent lasts a long time. Great purchase.
"I licked this oil when I got it as part of the 8 scent package I received several months ago. So, I ordered this specific scent based on that and I am very happy that I have it again. It's not a fruity or floral scent, it has a more earthy masculine fragrance, perfect for me."
"The BEST cotton candy scent I’ve found. I’ve spent a lot of money over the past 9 months on finding the perfect scents. As far as a cotton candy goes, you won’t find a better one than this! I will say that it could be stronger, other than that it’s perfect."
The bottle is a decent size moneys worth for sure last w long time.i don't really care for smell but that's juste.not that it's a bad smell just not for me.
Well worth the price bc the scent is amazing. I used these to make candles and the scent is super strong and I have gotten nothing but compliments on how wonderful my candles smell. Especially the pumpkin spice and homemade pumpkin pie scent. I will definitely be buying more.
"I liked the great smell.don,t like that it's not enough of it"
Works perfectly with my reed diffusers and smells excellent!
I do like the fragrance which is very light. Wished it was a bit more potent
The quantity of the refill for the price is very good. Some of the name brands prices for smaller amounts are pretty substantial. Only the selection is a bit of a shortcoming.
"saves time & a little $ if you want to do your own refillsWatched the ""how-to"" videos before purchasing. This is where I stopped making & started buying!I don't want to be a chemist. Besides I had all these fine little bottles and could not find any dbl units that only had one scent in the dbl bottles! So it takes 10 ml per Wix bottle (divided into the 500ml bulk refill.) vs $ for a completely new unit. (What if I don't like Hawaiian & Lavender spewing out at the same time?) My compromise solution, I guess."
I am disappointed -- fragrance does NOT permeate the room at all
Love the scent coming from my reed diffuser!
I find the scent is pleasant but very weak. If you prefer very subtle then this will work for you.
"Iâ€™ve been on numerous long flights and have never been able to find a travel pillow that allows me to sleep comfortably, especially in the section of an airplane that doesnâ€™t fully recline into a bed. This travel pillow is perfect. Itâ€™s easy to travel with, itâ€™s comfortable, and I donâ€™t wake up with neck pain, it keeps my head and neck comfortable, prevent me from snoring on the plane and I sleep so well with it. Iâ€™ve tried many pillows, but this one is one of the best ones Iâ€™ve ever tried, and a great value for the money. I purchase several for my family members who travel Internationally as well, it makes a great gift - I highly recommend it."
