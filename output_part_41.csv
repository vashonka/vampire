I need a shoe that has stretch on the top portion of the shoe to accommodate the bone on my foot. I found these shoes and it is all I wear. It feels like I am walking on air. I cannot express how much I love these shoes. They run big so I purchase one size smaller than my regular size and they fit perfectly. You will love them!!!
"I have very narrow feet, so finding a comfortable slip-on walking shoe is not easy. I also was looking for something that did not resemble an athletic shoe. After some research I decided to try this shoe for a trip. Originally I was just going to wear them through the airports, but instead ended up wearing them for the entire trip, which entailed a lot of city walking. The shoes are very comfortable, sort of like wearing house slippers everywhere. They are also understated enough that they fit well with a business casual look. However, even through these were sold as narrow, they are wider than I like. Still, they are so well-constructed that they did not slide around too much and I could not walk out of them; also, even though a little looser than I expected, they did not rub and leave blisters. However, if you need a shoe with more arch or ankle support, they are probably not for you. After a week of constant use, they also still look good and the soles do not show wear."
"Very lightweight! Easy slip on and off,Looks cute and is also very functional and comfortable.Wore it with socks so not sure about blister? But is slip resistant too."
"Oh wow! I took a chance and ordered these. Because I don't usually order shoes online. And I am so glad I did! They are extremely comfortable.I can wear them all day long. I ordered nine and a half narrow which is a half size larger than usual, but they fit perfectly. They are mesh on top, so don't expect them to be waterproof.But I do think they give a nice firm footing, and I love them."
"Best shoes ever!! So lightweight yet good support. Slip on nicely. Do not need ""breaking in""!!! Comfortable immediately! Love so much I bought another pair and will again!"
shoe is super lightweight and very comfy.  Not as much arch support as I would like/need.  Just recovering from 8 months of plantar fasciitis so I'm a little keen on wearing the right shoe.  I just wear these around the house so they work great. I do recommend that you give them a try and the fit is right on.
Size is correct.
I feel like I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m wearing slippers. These shoes are slip on easy and very comfortable.
"I was worried these would look nerdy for Disneyland but they were perfect! Super comfy, my feet didn‚Äôt hurt at all either day I wore them and I wore them ALL day at Disney. I have a very wide foot and they are true to size. Great support. Super nice quality. And they were easy to wipe off and keep clean!"
"This is my 7th pair of Skechers memory foam shoes! I keep buying them because they are so freaking comfortable! Sizing is spot on and let me tell you, they will last for two years at least! And the foam is like walking on a cloud! Definitely worth the price!!! I've had the blue ones, pink and black and now white ones and they all were consistent with the wear and tear on them. Of course the white get dirty quick. I did order wide width just because I like a little room in my shoe. They mold to your foot in no time and will be your fave pretty quickly!!! Definitely will order again!"
"The Skechers Women's D'Lites Fresh Start Mem sneaker is a fantastic blend of comfort and style. As someone who spends a lot of time on my feet, I appreciate the lightweight design and cushioned insole. The shoe provides excellent support, making it perfect for both casual wear and light exercise.The retro-inspired design adds a touch of vintage charm, while the modern colorways keep the look fresh and trendy. The shoe is true to size, fits comfortably and slip resistant.Overall, the Skechers D'Lites Fresh Start Mem is a great choice for anyone seeking a comfortable and stylish sneaker that can be dressed up or down."
"Cute with a little bit of sparkly silver accents. These are very comfortable and have good arch support. Good fit as any Skechers to me. The leather quality is good and durable, but the initial stiffness of the leather makes the shoes feel bulky. I guess I have to wear them more and break them to feel more like my shoes. I feel that I can walk more stably when I‚Äôm wearing these which is a plus."
"These Skechers fresh start memory foam lace ups are comfortable and the insoles are very spongy. The souls themselves give when you move on them. So your heel doesn't hurt. However, the shoes run too small for someone who doesn't have a pointed foot. In addition, when wearing athletic type socks that are cushioned, the shoes are too short as well. There just isn't enough room for active use.So, I had to send these back and I ended up getting men's shoes that are wider. A 6 1/2 man's regular is wider than a woman's 8 wide, but about the same length. My advice to my wide footed friends is to pass. But if you have narrow feet and your toes are not splayed but more pointed, these shoes will probably be very comfortable for you. Again, if you have an athletic foot and wear thick, cushioned socks then you might wanna go with a man's shoe. So for some people this is going to be a very comfortable shoe. The rubber soles and the foam insoles will be nice and forgiving, forgiving on your heel or when you step on a rock.The shoe is attractive and some versions are not leather. Additionally, the angle of the shoe with the higher heel is also adequate and will probably help you if you stand on your feet for a long time. I would recommend these shoes but only for some people. Happy days."
"I only buy these shoes. They are nice white shoes that go with everything/ comfy and offer arch support. They are washer safe and easy to clean. And last for a long time, I wore them everywhere and everyday  for an entire year before they began to really wear down."
I love these shoes. They fit great and don't hurt at all. They also look great. They have sparkly little round things next to the laces that really dress them up.
I've bought these in different colors. The design changes a little bit but they are comfortable and good quality true to size
"I was wary to buy a pair of shoes on Amazon but given the high ratings, and the fact they reminded me of the Dr.Scholls memory foam runners I used to buy, I decided to take a chance. Im glad I did!They are very light weight but well made, the memory foam makes them soooo comfy!! They are true to size. I think I have found my new pair of running shoes and I definitely would repurchase these. My only complaint is I feel like the back by the heel could be a little higher for more support , but that‚Äôs probably just because what I‚Äôm used to.I love these sketcher d‚Äôlites!! Buy a pair, you won‚Äôt regret it."
Looking good and comfortable üòç
The size was not what I usually wear. Making the shoe smaller than before
"I recently purchased the Skechers Women‚Äôs Hands Free Summits Dazzling Haze shoes for my elderly mother, and they have been an absolute game-changer for her! These shoes are perfect for anyone who wants comfort, style, and convenience, especially for seniors who may have difficulty bending down to tie or take off their shoes.Hands-Free Convenience: The standout feature of these shoes is the hands-free design. My mother no longer has to struggle with laces or bending down to put on or remove her shoes. She simply slips them on and off with ease, which has made her daily routine so much simpler and more comfortable.Comfort and Support: These shoes are incredibly comfortable. They have a cushioned insole that provides excellent support for her feet, which is crucial for her as she spends a lot of time on her feet. The memory foam insole molds to her feet, offering personalized comfort that lasts all day.Stylish Design: Despite being highly functional, these shoes do not compromise on style.

Great shoes!  Comfortable fit true to size and easy on and off with no hands.
"Great feel, easy on and off. Looks great feels good."
"After recent knee replacement, I needed a good pair of sneakers for rehab & recovery. Comfort, sturdiness & slip-on features were a must. These fit the bill in every way - I now LIVE in them & just ordered a 2nd color. Only bummer, the style is older so just 3 colors available. On the bright side, the price point is excellent."
"They‚Äôre a bit on the narrow side, but they are comfortable and easy to get on if you have mobility issues"
"I purchased the black shoes with black soles.  The shoes provide support for walking and have been comfortable from the first day.  They are versatile for traveling.  Since the shoes and soles are black, you can wear them for evening events.  They are light weight and washable.  I find them to be true to size.  I have a pair that I have worn for three years for yard work, and they are still in good shape.  I recommend the shoes."
"Over the course of the last year I have tried on numerous pairs of slip on shoes.  After purchasing some at an excellent price at Walmart, I really wanted another pair that fit just a little better so I didn't have to touch the heels at all in order to get the shoes on.I used Prime Try-Before-You-Buy several times to try the Sketchers Slip Ons and never could find a pair that would really work.  They were all either too wide or too big or too small.When these were offered at a great price for Prime members ahead of Black Friday 2024, I took another chance.  And I'm so glad I did!  These slip ons go right on, without me having to touch anything on my feet!  They are wonderful!  Even though I got a blue pair, they are so great and feel so good,  I don't care if I wear them with a black or brown outfit!!  I'm wearing them!All around, these are excellent shoes!  A+++++"
I debated these vs. other hands free sneakers that were twice as much $.  These work perfectly fine. I like how you can slip them on without using your hands to quick take out the trash or drive a child to school last-minute.  They are pretty comfortable as well.  I wore them for a weekend walking around Salem MA doing 2 walking tours while pushing around a friend who was unfortunately in a wheelchair on endless cobblestone sidewalks.  My feet didn't start hurting until after several hours/ miles of walking on the main day.  Highly recommend!
Great slip in sneakers no bending down to put them on.  I like the design and very comfortable.  Wash well in the washing machine.
"These shoes fit very well. Extremely comfortable right from the first day I wore them. They are great to wear all day walking in. There seem to be no breaking in period.I highly recommend these, true to size, shoes."
Great shoe! Super comfortable and so easy to slip on and just go! And fits great! Love my Skechers!
Very comfortable and light.It‚Äôs very easy to slip in and out as they advertise.I‚Äôm very happy with the shoes.
"The Skechers Men's Nampa Food Service Shoe is a comfortable and durable option for those working in the food service industry. Designed with a slip-resistant rubber outsole, these shoes provide excellent traction, helping to prevent slips and falls in busy environments. The memory foam insole offers all-day comfort, while the smooth leather upper is easy to clean, making it a practical choice for anyone on their feet for long hours.These shoes have a sleek, professional look, while being lightweight and supportive, ensuring both comfort and safety.Overall, the Skechers Nampa Food Service Shoe is a reliable, functional, and stylish choice for those needing a comfortable work shoe for demanding jobs."
"Seem like good quality, typically Skechers work shoes hold up a good long time, and I am HARD on shoes.  Lots of time working and walking on concrete floors, tons of stairs, etc.  comfort, support and long life are always top of my requirements.  Non-slip is a good bonus.These seem to run a little narrow, or my usual shoes run wide maybe??  Either way I usually wear a size 10 in Skechers work shoes, but these in size ten were too tight in the toes and longer than I needed.  9.5 extra wide was perfect.  Super comfortable right out of the box."
"This is a great work shoe. I bought these for my boyfriend and they've held up great. Their perfect for working in a restaurant kitchen, the slip resistant sole works like it should and their not overly heavy. They are comfortable enough to have on for long shifts and give enough support so that your feet don't hurt at the end of the day.Only complaint is that the sides of the inner sole fell apart somewhat quick."
I get these for my son for fast food service and they seem to take daily abuse for about 8+ months before any sign of failure and he says they are comfortable enough that we reordered for the third time to replace. The price meets the value and the service....
"Good, basic comfortable work shoe if you're on your feet all day.  I just make sure I replace them (for my husband) as soon as the padding stops easing his feet."
So comfortable and fit perfect almost a balance to the texture of them perfect tight love them will always have to order these year-round
"I do like that it looks good with formal wear, even though it's a work shoe. Stretches to fit my wide feet. So farit has performed well as a slip resistant shoe. However, an issue has just occured. The stitching on the toe of the right shoe is starting to come undone. It must have happened when I walked through the rain. Can't believe it would come loose after it first rainfall. Have to reconsider buying this type of shoe since the sketches shoe I bought had the same problem."
"I picked the right size for these shoes and they fit perfectly. Usually I tend to wear a 9.5 wide but a 9 relaxed fit also works too. I wanted to make sure I didn't choose the wrong size or a wide fit in case they feel too loose when I'm walking. I tried them on the first day after picking up my Amazon packages and the quality is very durable, traction soles are sturdy and it's very easy to wear. Memory foam  is ok, not very soft but fortunately my soles don't get tired from working. These are a great replacement for my previous pair of work shoes for my job at Publix whenever I'm closing and have to clean or do inventory. I also recommend these pairs for casual days as well."
"Comfort: These shoes are incredibly comfortable. The insole is well-cushioned, providing excellent support for long hours of wear. My son didn‚Äôt experience any discomfort or blisters, even on the first day.Design: The design is sleek and stylish, perfect for both casual and formal occasions. The attention to detail is evident, with clean stitching and a polished finish.Durability: The materials used are of high quality. The leather feels sturdy yet supple, and the sole is robust, offering good traction. After three days of use, they still look as good as new.Fit: The sizing was accurate, and the shoes fit perfectly. They offer a snug fit without being too tight, which is often a concern with online purchases.Value for Money: Considering the quality, these shoes are a great value for the price.  .Overall, I highly recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a combination of comfort, style, and durability. They have exceeded my expectations in every way."
I should have got a size bigger but they are fairly comfortable
I bought these white leather sneakers as casual wear.  I don't like to pay a lot for shoes and these were perfect for me since they look good and are comfortable.
"My son loves these.  He‚Äôs been asking for white sneaker-shoes, and rather than get canvas one that will get worn out easily, I bought these. They feel substantial while still giving him that sporty look.  And at a good price!"
"Very good delivery time, good quality, perfect size; not a five because a little bit heavy"
"Pleasantly surprised on the quality of these shoes - well made, comfortable and look sturdy. Really like them and would recommend these to anyone."
Comfy to wear to work and easy to keep clean.Feels like good quality
great shoe
"Very good and comfortable, but start wear it out after 2 months of office use only."
I wear these everyday with my work uniform. They fit well and are comfortable all day. If they get dirty I just wipe them off with a wet cloth and I‚Äôm good to go. I recommend them to my fellow coworkers.
"The Under Armour Girls Pre School Assert 10 A sneakers are fantastic! My daughter absolutely loves them. They‚Äôre lightweight yet durable, making them perfect for all her running, jumping, and playing. The fit is true to size, and the cushioned soles provide great comfort and support, even after long days of wear.What I really appreciate is the quality‚Äîthese shoes have held up beautifully despite all the wear and tear from playgrounds and outdoor activities. Plus, the design is stylish and fun, so my daughter is excited to put them on every day."
"These are perfect! Great fit, style and quality. I didn‚Äôt have to go to the store though which makes back to school shopping so much easier with little ones! Price was great too! No more running store to store trying to find the right shoe in the right size. Thanks Amazon!"
"These fit true to size for Under Armor (which in my opinion runs a bit small.) I sized up a bit to make sure they fit my son well and they did. He said they are super fast shoes!The shoes are a bit wider than I was expecting as far as the sole goes. The white under the black mesh also isn‚Äôt as visible in real life like it is in the photo. I was a little disappointed in that.Overall, a good quality shoe for young feet. Would recommend and get again."
"I have purchased this brand many times. Every pair has held up, especially for a kid that loves putting rocks in his shoes since Pre-K. So I would have to clean them out & sometimes wash them out in the sink, instead of the washer. I'd wash them out spray them with a safe Lysol clothing spray & dry them with a fan. + I use these shoe eraser from DG to get the bottom souls back as new as possible on the white souls we've had in the past. Doing that made the last 1's last almost 2yrs(They're hand me downs now). I have to buy a size(or size &¬Ω) up, they do run smaller. It would be nice if they offered the wide in all the styles. The straps should be longer, over time they either come undone, & seem to get shorter after they get broken in good. I would definitely recommend them.Update! ..I had to return these for a bigger size & I was charged twice, 1st was the $43.89 the 2nd was the other one $33.74. so I don't know what they did charging for both pairs. They owe me a refund of $43.89 what the 1st ones cost. I haven't heard back from Amazon since I called about them, I've tracked the return package it shows it was received. So I guess I can say I ended up paying full price+ some."
We love under armor for our kids and with the ages of 5 and under we need something that is easy to get on and off.  The appearance was nice and the fit was good once they were on but they were so tight trying to get them on originally.  Definitely good value but might have to wait till my little ones can slide their own shoes on
"I bought them for my son's Christmas present. Omgoodness!!! They're amazing! The color, the style, and the quality.  I want to gift it to him now, but I'm not haha."
My son is 8 and he is ROUGH on his shoes. They barely last through his activity let alone the growth spurts. I have purchased this style in several colors over the last few years and they have held up so well. He finds them comfortable for daily use at school and they're easy to wipe clean so they still look great after a few months. Highly reccomend for active little boys.
My daughter loves these shoes. I think they are super cute and exactly as pictured above.  The colors are very pretty. They fit well and are comfortable. The quality is great. They have held up well too. I think the price point is good for these shoes. I would purchase again.
I must say it‚Äôs avg shoes
"At a certain point in life, a man reaches a deeper understanding.  A viewpoint that permanently alters his worldview, and makes him question all that came before.  This can happen slowly, as experience and knowledge grows, and ultimately crystalizes around a kernel of this new perspective.  Or it can happen suddenly, in an epiphany of recognition that forces a foundational frame of reference adjustment.  Yesterday I experienced the latter, and I wanted to share it in case any of you have yet to reach a similar point.  As enter the fall of life, I feel compelled to offer this new personal world order in the hope that you may benefit longer than I will likely enjoy.While this change thunder-struck me suddenly yesterday, some background will help put the revelation in proper context.  It all started with the bankruptcy of Sears.  Sears engaged in a foolhardy acquisition strategy during the 1980's of retail and non-retail businesses that would be completely undercut by the digital revolution of the 1990's.  The debt accumulated from these various acquisitions would drag on company financial statements for decades as revenues slowly eroded to online shopping alternatives.  Finally, in the face of an unmanageable October 2018 debt payment of $134 million, Sears declared Chapter 11.  Eddie Lampert made several attempts to secure funding for a reorganization strategy, but they would all ultimately fail.  None of this impacted me until the end of 2019 when the last Sears in Jacksonville closed.At that point I had a shoe problem.  For decades I had purchased brown four-hole lace-up suede loafers from Sears.  They were a store brand that sold for $30 or $40.  I had probably purchased a dozen or more pair of these.  I would often buy two or three pair at a time so I wouldn't need to return to the store so often as they wore out.  But now Sears and my default shoe choice were gone!  Panic ensued.  I started searching the internet for the manufacturer of this shoe which I had enjoyed for so many years.  The hope was that another distribution channel would emerge, or that a transition to online sales could be found.  No luck.  So at the dawn of COVID-19, I was facing an existential shoe crisis.It was about March 2020 when my last trusty Sears loafers were at end-of-life.  Most real world retail was shuttered, and supply chain disruption was in full force.  There were no shoes to buy.  Finally, a local Rack Room reopened and I scoured the shelves for a suitable replacement.  I eventually settled for a deck style shoe that was only mildly stylistically objectionable, but seemed acceptably comfortable as one of the very few models offered in wide width.  For nearly two and a half years this daily worn (weekday) pair of shoes sustained me.  Last week I was forced back to the retail experience for a hopefully improved selection of casual shoe options.Did I find an improved post-COVID selection?  Hell no, I did not!  It was WAY worse.  There were no wide offerings at all!  Three shoe store visits left me cursing the pathetic state of IRL retail, and the stupid business people who were essentially forcing me to shop online.  So home to Amazon I went, with the name of an untried shoe brand and model seen in a store.  It was a pleasing looking set of footwear that I was going to gamble might be suitable.  And the size variety available on Amazon was breathtaking.  All the sizes I was familiar with, that were completely missing from any store, were available with a click.  I don't know when stores decided that they couldn't offer size selection.  They certainly did in the 1970's!  How did they lose that ability?  Anyway, shoes selected and ordered online with delivery anticipated in a couple days.  Fine.Ladies and gentleman, this is it.  These Rockport Oxford Eureka Walking Shoes are THE most comfortable shoes I have ever owned...bar none.  I am gobsmacked by how comfortable these shoes are.  Eureka is right!  I think back to pre-Rockport me and shake my head in sorrow.  Poor fella.  Stuck in a rut of frugally driven brick-and-mortar retail based consumption resulting in the bare minimum of utility.  Not even guessing about the possibility that such a paradigm shift could be out there.  Who knows what might have been if that version of me had found these shoes earlier?  Years of an improved outlook on life is the most obvious missed opportunity.  Perhaps he would have turned to philanthropy?  Trying to engineer life improvements for those around him in an effort to induce similar outlook-altering reactions in society's less fortunate?  I literally skipped around the house yesterday sharing the good news with my family.  I haven't skipped since a 1973 visit to Cedar Point with my Aunt Fran.  Eureka my friends.  Eureka indeed.  If you're in need, I beg you to give these shoes a try.  If I can convince just one of you, then this lunchtime prose will have been worth it.Edit: Two year update on durability - These spectacular shoes have been part of my workday fit for two years now.  No major durability issues to report.  The highest wear was on the insole.  The soles still have quite a bit of life, and are still well attached to the uppers.  One black pair I bought has fully thrown their insoles, and the brown pair have significantly worn insoles.  I still feel that this wear pattern is above average compared to my past shoe purchases.  So much so, I just ordered another pair of both black and brown Rockport Oxford Eureka Walking Shoes.  Love 'em, and looking forward to the fresh kicks!"
"As an Airline Pilot, I walk many miles around airports. I find these shoes to be comfortable and stylish. They fit my large 13 wide feet well. They clean up easily and the leather tops look nice with my bi-weekly waxing. I believe the quality of the shoes match their price point."
"Bought these to replace my worn Rockport Mens Junction Point Lacetotoe in hopes the rubber sole on this shoe would last longer than the non-rubber sole of the Junction Points.  While it seems to be a very durable shoe and overall comfortable, the crease created in the toe box from the shoe bending rubs the top of my big toe enough to cause discomfort.The Junction Points did not have this issue but their sole wore out in less than a year.  Will have to find a different shoe as I wear these for daily walking for work."
"The extra width is great for my toes.Comfort is key when you are over 75 and these are very comfortable.I've always liked the quality of Rockport and these caught my eye at this price point, so I bought a pair and I am not disappointed.I have been on my feet all day preparing for Thanksgiving.  I didn't realize I had been wearing these shoes all day - but I have.  My feet don't ache and they could talk they would say ""This is a good deal."""
"I ordered a 10 X-Wide pair of these Rockport Men's Eureka walking shoes from Amazon a couple of months ago,  and they were without question the best pair of shoes that I had purchased since the 1980s.  Actually, these shoes are not only attractive and sharp looking, but extremely comfortable as well.  In fact, if I was smart, I should be thinking about purchasing another pair of these Rockport Men's Eureka walking shoes.You know, they sure have a good thing going with these shoes so I wouldn't change the design no how.  By the way, the X-Wide would be comparable to either the EE or EEE width.  So there you have it.  If you want a sharp looking and very comfortable pair of walking shoes, look no further than the Rockport Men's Eureka walking shoes."
Comfortable and they hold up well
"Look nice and comfortable, but some of the outer color is flaking off around the outside upper heel making the shoe look unprofessional. Not sure why as this area does not really wear against anything... Disappointing after only wearing them a couple of months."
"These are awesome shoes.  They last for a very long time.  They run a bit tight, and pretty stiff.  I use old-school techniques, that I learned in the Army, for new Rockports.  I put them on, and wear them for an hour.  I'm not going to lie, they chew on my feet pretty hard for that hour.  Then I wear them for a couple of hours, on some errands that require walking.  They start out biting pretty hard, but after a couple of hours, they feel like a good pair of gloves, and they're like walking on clouds.  The third time, I wear them to work.  I pack a spare pair of shoes, in case my feet get too sore, but they usually don't.  After that third day, they might be a little hard to put on, but once on, they're super comfortable.  I have a pair that are 5 years old, still look great for office work, and are one of two pairs of shoes that I go to when I know I'm going to be on my feet a lot.  It's a process to break them in, but good leather requires break in.  These shoes are worth it!"
"Very comfortable shoes, look very nice too. I've had them abous a month and malfunctions so far. Sole still looks very sturdy and they are very waterproof"
"I had been wanting some nice looking leather look black sneakers, these fit great, and are very comfortable. Would buy again!"
They are comfortable. How they wear over time is yet to be seen. Good if you're on a budget.
"These were the first FILA shoes I've tried. They are priced lower than most other brands. They are very comfy, with memory foam insoles and all around cushy feel. They are aimed at indoor workers, especially food prep folks, and emphasize their non-slip soles. The sole pattern is finely divided and may tend to track in mud if used outdoors. They aren't designed for trail walking. They look and feel good, so I'm happy with them. They are a little looser on the toe end than I expected, and I have pretty wide size 11 feet. These were the third pair of shoes I tried under the Prime Try before you buy feature, which includes free return shipping if you don't want to keep them. FILA won me over from New Balance, which I've worn for 10 years or more."
