It was smaller than expected and the handle came broken. Definitely not worth the money.After my review the company took the time to reach out to me over the issue with my purchase and not only did they apologize before anything else but then they have offered to give me a full refund on the product.EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I look forward to dealing with them again!!!
My granddaughter loves it.
"This case is ridiculous. Not even fit for my 6 year old. The latch won't hold so it doesn't stay shut, defeats the purpose of a carry case."
Loved the item
Product is good.
Bought this for my 11 year old who wants to try makeup. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a pretty nice set for the price.
Perfect
This All in One Makeup Kit has a great variety of different brushes and makeup choices.The arrived nicely packaged in a box and everything listed was included. The makeup holds up well and was easy to remove.This would be a great gift idea for teens or someone starting to try makeup.
This all in one set of makeup application comes in a small box but has all you need to do your makeup.  The colors are vibrant and the rollers work perfectly.  After applying some lipstick and eye liners I realized the set is worthed. Have fun.
Has so many things!!
The shades seem to highlight the eyes. Great selection. All shades for all women. Great price. Highly recommend..All colors for every occasion
"First of all, the color selection is absolutely incredible! You've got everything from vibrant pinks to stunning reds, and even some unique and trendy shades. It's like having a whole rainbow of lip colors at your fingertips!But it's not just about the colors, the formula is also top-notch. The lip gloss goes on smoothly and evenly, giving your lips a gorgeous, glossy finish. And the best part? It's not sticky at all! You won't have to worry about your hair getting stuck to your lips on a windy day. Plus, it's long-lasting, so you can enjoy beautiful, vibrant lips all day long without constant touch-ups.Whether you're going for a natural everyday look or want to make a bold statement, the Color Nymph lip gloss has got you covered. It's the perfect accessory to complete any makeup look and add a touch of glamour. Trust me, you'll absolutely love it! üíÑüíã"
"I ordered 2 of these one for my mom (gold) and one for myself (brown). The brown one I noticed has a garlic smell in the bottom tray. I can't really figure out why but I'm assuming something in it contains neem oil. (Hopefully ) Aside from that the colors are beautiful. The eyeshadows have a slightly weak pigment. The color is there, but it's not overwhelming. The eyeshadows are also a bit powdery. The blush and highlights are gorgeous and the brown pallet is great for fair to medium skintone. I tried the lip gloss, it's kind of sticky but not bad. Overall I do like the pallet and I think it makes a really great gift for anyone! Just make sure it doesn't smell like garlic before you gift it lol."
"As advertised, not horrible quality, great price. Perfect for beginners"
"I am experimenting with makeup after several years of being makeup free.  These are small, almost sample size.  I enjoyed trying out the differences in the 3 types of lip products.  Great for newcomers and anyone just trying out lip products.  It will give you a good idea of what colors look good on you.  Good value."
My granddaughter loves this. A bit cheap. She just plays with it
"Excellent quality lip gloss/tint, great selection of colors, great price!!  I gave away the reds and kept the rest - love this product. Doesn‚Äôt dry the lips and provides the perfect tint."
Needs More darker concealers and bigger brushes
Good quality nice color loved the combination and value for money .üëç
I would just like to say I was very disappointed in the product and the fact that everything was in Chinese or whatever language you had on it. Just absolutely no good
Nice over all
"Mmmmm‚Ä¶. Not too sure because I couldn‚Äôt read any of it‚Ä¶ everything was written in Chinese so I‚Äôm unsure what kind of ingredients were in anything other than the cream palette that had mica, titanium dioxide already don‚Äôt like that.Most things had a very fruity smell, the lipsticks smelled really good because they contain ‚Äúessence‚Äù they smelled heavily of cherry. The mascara also had a fruity smell which was a little strange.The makeup brushes were awful and smelled like chemicals‚Ä¶ the aloe Vera lip oil had a pink applicator and turned my lips pink though it was a clear gloss I found that strange as well."
Perfect march for skin
"**Pros:**- **Comprehensive Set**: Includes a large variety of makeup items, perfect for endless fun.- **Real and Washable**: Safe for kids, easily washable to prevent any mess.- **Princess Theme**: Adorable design that appeals to young girls.- **Perfect Gift**: Ideal for birthdays or special occasions for kids aged 3-12 years old.Overall, it's a fantastic makeup kit that offers both fun and safety for kids, making it a perfect gift option."
"I recently bought the Hollyhi 58 Pcs Kids Makeup Kit for my daughter, and it's been a hit! The variety of colors and accessories is fantastic, and the washable formula makes cleanup a breeze. She loves the mirror and feels like a real princess while playing. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s perfect for imaginative play and makes an excellent birthday gift. The quality is impressive for a kids' set, and I appreciate the attention to safety. Highly recommend this kit for any young makeup enthusiast!"
"My daughters loved this! They are always asking to use my makeup and now they have their own. I love that it comes with everything from powder/blush to eye shadow and lip gloss, as well as the peel off nail polish. And comes with a bunch of makeup brushes so they aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t stealing mine. It also has plenty of room for extra makeup. They have been carrying around their makeup totes since they opened them. Definitely recommend this product!"
"This item was a tad smaller than I expected. The quality isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t terrible but could be better. It is definitely very cute for a child. Only complain I have is that 1 of the lipsticks came with no lid and the drawers are a little hard to open without feeling like you are gonna break it. Other than that, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s decent for the price. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s for my 7 year old so she is going to love it."
"I got this as a gift for my very talented make-up artist niece, and she loved it. It is all washable and safe ingredients for her skin. It comes with an awesome book of makeup ideas and tutorials and has provided me with me some very cute pictures of my niece for the last couple weeks. So glad I got this for her and she is putting it to good use."
"This was okay for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She loves it and that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s what matters.It is cheap though. The quality of the brushes are poor and broke very quickly as well as the lipsticks. The shadows are difficult to get pigment from without using a ton of product.The description of what each pallet is, isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t listed on the actual makeup case, but the plastic covers. So once you remove them, you don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know what each pallet is. Again, not an issue for a 2 year old who doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know how to read anyways, but I was definitely curious what was what while playing with her.  Overall it did the job.It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s easy to wipe off, the nail polish dries very quickly and comes off with ease in the bath."
This is going to be a very cute Christmas gift for my 4 year old niece who loves mamaws makeup.  Now she will have her own vanity.  It is a little smaller than expected from the Amazon pictures but still perfect for little hands.  Had to pry the brush drawer open first time but now it is opening easily.
loves having her own makeup kit
Bought for friends 3 year. Loved it
"Not worth $70 AU. Very poor quality, Very small case. Little bigger than the size of my hand. I expected a decent size case, with good quality kids makeup in it for the price I paid. Very disappointed! Also the case broke straight away."
"These are actually amazing. I got these for my christmas tree but I had to open some of the items to see how the product was. I picked out the blush and the pigment was really good, I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t expect that. I also opened the lipstick, loved the shade and the pigment again. Great set of make-up items. Loved it!!"
"I bought my litte sister this makeup kit last year for Christmas. I honestly expected her to lose it all within a few months, but the case it comes with is sturdy and has held up and kept all her products safe. The price was great and the quality was good considering its cheap beginner makeup. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d buy it again!"
Christmas gift for granddaughter. Look like she'll love it!
10th birthday present. She seemed to love the selection of make-up and the carrying case was nice.
"My daughter loved this. If was worth the price for sure. Easy to take off and she feels like such a big girl having her own ""make"" up."
Definitely was a great gift. Super fun!
She‚Äö√Ñ√¥s 6 loves  putting makeup on me. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll have to get her another one ‚Äö√π¬ß√î‚àè√®
I think she will love this for Christmas
"The price was very good. There are a lot of makeup options and they wash off my daughter easy. The jewel stickers were so much fun and there were a lot. After decorating the makeup box, there were tons of jewel stickers left to decorate other toys or my kids faces, and they did! Happy about this purchase!"
My 5-year-old granddaughter loved this bright and glittery makeup set. I don't mind a little mess in the bathroom because it all cleans up very well. It's easy to remove from her face too.
"Saw this in an old Christmas Amazon catalog my daughter keeps. My daughter has autism and prefers to have pictures to point at. Anyway, great quality for the price."
This makeup is super cute and pretty decent quality. Had a hard time opening at first but then we haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had any problems since. Came with lots of brushes and colors. The stickers were a nice bonus
"You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get as much as you used to there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not much make up in the trays, and this stuff has stained her clothes"
Child was very excited just what she wanted
My daughter messed over this in 2 business days but good product
Perfect birthday gift for my 3 year old granddaughter. She loves it. Very reasonable price as well
My daughter is super happy with this present! I got it for her birthday and she asked to wear them often. Some of the eye colours aren't the best (can't see the color after applying) but some leaves nice pretty colours on eye lid.
Fun to play withMore than I thought wasAll the kids enjoyed. Kids who normal don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t play with make up were playing with the make upAdults were also getting in the fun.
The plastic box is poor and can dismantle and the glitters will be the first to end. But overall this just fascinate the 4 yo girls who received.
It is a really cute makeup kit and my Great Granddaughter will love it. I bought it for her birthday.
"This product looks fairly good, however, when the item arrived one of the colours is broken and another one has some odd goop covering it."
"After 20 years of trying different curling irons, I can confidently say this one is the best! What really sets it apart is the extra-long barrel‚Äîit's a game-changer. I‚Äôve never had a curling iron with a barrel this long, and it makes such a difference. It‚Äôs perfect for my long hair, allowing me to curl larger sections at once, which saves so much time and gives me consistent  curls.Another huge plus is the high temperature it reaches. It heats up quickly and delivers the kind of hold I‚Äôve always wanted, but it doesn‚Äôt leave my hair dry or damaged. I‚Äôve used other irons that would leave my hair feeling brittle, but this one is much gentler while still delivering long-lasting curls.I‚Äôm so happy I invested in this curling and the price point is great!! It works so much better than any curling iron I‚Äôve used in the past, and the extra-long barrel was exactly what I was missing. Definitely worth the purchase‚Äîhighly recommend it to anyone looking for great curls without the damage!"
I saw a stylist using this curling iron in my hair salon. I bought it and couldn't be happier. It works well. The range of temperature is a nice feature and the controls are easy to use and don't get in the way. It's sleek and sharp looking and it works well. My hair is only shoulder length and it works well on my hair. The design makes it easier to reach and curl the back.

This curling iron is worth the hype. I bought it on sale for here so fast. Doesn‚Äôt take long to heat up. The curls are really pretty I got the 1.25 inch and it‚Äôs perfect it leave the curls kinda lose. It does have automatic shut off. The barrel is longer. It gives really pretty curls. Wish I had bought it sooner.
Just got this thing yesterday and I‚Äôm already obsessed! Easiest curler I‚Äôve ever used. I love the extra long barrel and it wraps my hair gently without over pulling it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever use another brand after this
Makes curling hair so fast and easy! Beautiful curl
"If you‚Äôre looking for a curling iron that offers professional results without the ultra high price tag, this pro curling iron is a great option. While it‚Äôs a bit of an investment, it‚Äôs actually more affordable than many high end styling tools, and the results speak for themselves.I have long, thick hair and the 1.25 inch works great, leaves hair smooth and shiny. There‚Äôs no tugging or pulling, just a smooth glide that feels gentle on my hair. The design makes it easy to maneuver, and with a bit of practice and the help of a few tutorials, I‚Äôve been able to perfect my waves.For best results, I found that taking time to get the technique down is key. Once you have that, the waves turn out beautifully, and they last all day with a light spritz of hairspray."
Love it. Leaves hair soft..works amazing
"I am brand new to using curling irons, and this was a great one to learn with. I like that it did not pull my hair at all and I love that it was long enough to wrap my section of hair. I find that other irons I‚Äôve tried to use were too short. The lock-in for the temperature setting is a game changer because I unintentionally must have pressed the temp button and off button a million times!! Highly recommend!"
This curling iron heats up fast with option to use high temperatures‚Äîwhich speeds up the styling process! It‚Äôs extra long barrel makes it much easier to create waves in shoulder length hair. It‚Äôs lightweight which is great for arthritic hands. Arrived very well packed.
"Great clipper with many comb sizes available.  There are larger sizes available then what is included in the kit.I use this to cut my own hair.  I was originally thinking I would just use it to make small adjustments to help extend the length between going to the hair stylist.  With the discovery of the 1.5"" wahl guide comb I am able to cut the hair on the top of my head, very easy to do with the cordless.  Cutting the sides requires a little thinking because I have 5/8"" on the sides and back.  After watching a couple on-line videos on how to cut hair with clippers I realized what needs to be done.Whenever I go to the hair stylist I always get let down with the cut.  The last time was the breaking point, it seemed like everything I was asked was just thrown out and my hair was cut their way.  Very frustrating to say the least.  I thought that in the worst case I could do no worse.  What I did was get one last hair cut after I purchased this clipper.  I watched very closely how it was done, not too close on the parts I didn't like.  Any way, I went home and put a guide comb on the clipper and with the clipper off, I pushed it through my hair.  I was able to find which guide comb was used on my head and how far up the sides.  I have 5/8"" on the sides and back and 1.5""; on the top.  Wahl makes the 1.5""; guide comb which really makes the deal.  I put the 1.5"" comb on the clipper and turned it on then ran it over my head, it just cut some stray hairs but I was able to see just how easy it was to use, I could hold it at all the angles needed to run over the top of my head.  Overrunning the sides and back were no issue since they are shorter.  Then I put on the clipper for the sides and ran it around. The area where the sides/back meet the top need to be blended gradually which is really easy using the technique on the Wahl website and shown in the instruction book, called blending.  The blending is using the rocking motion at the end of cut, the photo in the instructions and the video make it clear.  Same technique my hair stylist used too.So far I have done 3 hair cuts, I cut more often because there is no charge and I figured if I messed up the problem would be small.  The result was amazingly good and took almost no skill.  The hardest part is squaring off the back, kind of hard to look in a mirror and watch while moving the clipper.  I just did several dry runs, with the clipper off till I felt I had the technique correct then turned it on and cut.  Perfect results.  Now I cut my hair in the morning before taking a shower, no lost time sitting in a hair cut shop waiting to have a less than average hair cut.I received 12 guide comb attachments with the clipper.  I think there was more than the basic set.  Very happy with the quality of the combs.  The clipper feels good and it is not too heavy.  No cord really helps cutting your own hair.  The case is a soft zipper case, holds everything in it.  It is ok quality.  I have not yet ran a change out on the clipper, it lasts longer than I could possibly use it.  Perhaps for several hair cuts it would not make it but for one person no issue.  The rechargeable battery is the weak point, the instructions say it will only last 3-5 years.  Seems short but the instructions also say the clipper can be used with the cord plugged in.  So that would be the back for one day when it finally gives up.This really changed my mind on cutting my own hair.  It is no harder than trimming a beard, really easy for me to pick up.  If you ever thought about cutting your own hair give it a try, you may be surprised how easy it can be.  Just get it cut one more time at the hair stylist then go home and run the clipper with the comb attached, no power and see what was cut to which point.  That really helps teach you how to cut.UPDATE:  I have been using this clipper to cut my own hair for over 1 year.  I have improved cutting my hair a bit.  I cut my hair more often these days because it is no charge and I like to maintain the same general look. I'm amazed at how easy it is to cut my own hair, I should have tried this years ago.  It has become so easy to cut my own hair I hardly think about it any more.  I have become better at cutting my own hair so that it looks the way I like it.  And I can repeat it easily.  My wife likes the way it looks too."
"I was skeptical because it was so cheap, but honestly this is the best hair cutting kit I've ever purchased. I've cut my own hair since I was a teenager and this set is perfect. Quieter, lighter weight, smoother cut, and I especially love that the attachments are different colors to make it easier to find what you need"
"I like keeping my hair very short. Sometimes I even shave my head. I don‚Äôt have enough hair to go to a barber. Trimmers with cords can be quite  cumbersome. This trimmer caught my interest because it can be operated with or without the charging cord, it can be used with water and it is a common brand with which I am familiar.This trimmer takes very little time to charge. Once charged, it can be used several times before it needs to be recharged. Provided the trimmer hasn‚Äôt been run completely dead, it can be used while the charger is connected. Because the trimmer is cordless and can be used in water, I have used it in the shower for a quick trim. During the summer I occasionally will go outside to cut my hair so a do not have a mess inside.This trimmer comes with a handy kit. The kit includes a zip up carrying case, a comb, lubricant, a charging cable and a large assortment of guards in addition to the trimmer. The guards are pretty much useless to me because I have pathetic facial hair and I buzz the hair on my scalp without any guards. The trimmer may be a little large and cumbersome to regularly use it for facial hair. The bare trimmer gives a close cut, but I‚Äôd prefer if it got closer. My corded Wahl trimmer has a lever to toggle between two levels of closeness and I miss it on the cordless.This Wahl trimmer has a pretty wide head. I appreciate this for a couple reasons. With the wide head, it takes less time to trim my whole head. The second advantage of the wider head is I am less likely to miss a spot. I can overlap strokes to ensure coverage and still not take forever to complete the task.Because this trimmer is larger, heavier and a wider trimmer head, it does make it less practical for trimming facial hair especially around the mouth and nose. I mentioned before that this trimmer doesn‚Äôt get terribly close so that makes it less practical to use on the face because a longer stubble will be left in comparison to facial hair trimmers.In conclusion, I really like this trimmer, but I took a star off because the trimmer doesn‚Äôt get as close as I would prefer"
Cheap and useful. Best head shaver out there and wireless.
"light and much easier than corded. no problem with the low-end battery, don't use it all that much. my facial hair is sparse and light, so it works great for shaving too (I use cooking oil and running cool water, I have no idea whether that's safe but it works)"
