"Having recently traveled through Africa, I had nearly 50 hours of flying in a span of 3 weeks! Knowing this was coming up, I decided to upgrade my airplane pillow and settled on the Cabeau. Thankfully, I was not disappointed!I'll keep this very simple; see below for the Pros, Cons & Conclusion:Pros:- Comfortable (probably the best I've used)- Doesn't budge- Didn't smell- Packs nicely- Allows you to ""lean"" into it; if you're a side sleeper like myself, this helps.Cons:- There is really only 1 con, and that's how it works with headphones. Unfortunately, there's no way to cut it; this doesn't work well with headphones. Tiny earbuds, yes, but headphones rub along the side and push the headphones up. I had to switch to earbuds numerous times because the headphones wouldn't fit properly/Conclusion:  This is the best airplane pillow I have had the pleasure of using. If you have upcoming travel & want to upgrade your in-flight comfort, look no further. However, if you are someone who relies on bulky headphones during you're flight, you may want to consider another option."
"This pillow is very comfortable and a great size. It would be perfect for traveling purposes in more ways than one. It goes in the bag easily for carrying and great size for in a car. I laid on it to try it out, but I bought it to use as a between my legs while sleeping pillow and it's perfect for my purpose. I hate the weird knee pillows and regular pillows are too big."
Only used these in a hotel experience so far but purchased them for a primitive camping trip to Alaska. So far they have held up and are very comfortable. The size is perfect for travel and the carry case is fabulous. I added some rubberbands to help hold it's shape while getting it back into the travel bag. Perfect size to attach to my backpack for travel.
"I would have given this 5 stars if there had actually been a carrying bag included, as stated in the product description.  Firmness is perfect for my needs.  Works well as a leg pillow and small yet firm enough for a travel pillow."
"I bought these for the camped build I made for the back of my truck and they are perfect. I have slept a few nights with them now and this pillow is comfortable. I wish it was a little thicker but its fine. They roll us to a nice size, probably twice the width of a nalgene bottle and 2 inches taller. I also wish it came with a pillow case. Great pillow though."
I took this on a recent trip.  I sat on it during the plane ride.  I used it as a regular pillow when the hotel pillows were not comfortable.  It is the BEST travelling companion!
I like this pillow...hoping I can break it in...because it's so hard that it hurts the cartilage in my ears. Its a love hate relationship. The size is great! I had been using a small travel pullow for every night sleeping. This one fits into my standard pillow cases. Thickness is perfect. Quality is great.
So easy and lightweight to travel with and to pack!!!
"I LOVE this pillow, it is medium firm, and not too thin, but not too thick. I really dislike extra thick pillows so this is the perfect thickness and firmness. It supportive enough, but soft! I ditched my neck pillow and amused this one instead on my trip to Italy. I traveled for 11 days and I even used it instead of the hotel pillows and it has become my favorite pillow..even replacing my one that I used at home! I need them to make a full size version of this!!"
"You will definitely feel you got more than you paid for. HUGE bag, well made. My son uses this as his hockey bad for his hockey skates and gear with lots of room left over. The bad doesn't have a cardboard bottom to give it a structure as a lot of bags have but for the price it's been very good for our purposes. Definitely recommend this bag if you need a big bag."
"We flew on Avelo and they have specific dimensions for a checked bag, not only did the Dimensions nail it, but it fit about 54 pounds of clothes, we just brought a smaller carry-on to take out the extra when we were at their scale and it was perfect. You definitely need a person with muscles to carry it from the car to check it onto the airplane though because this beast is heavy! Can’t beat the price either!"
"Very very very efficient for traveling. The bags hold A LOT and weighs less than a pound each. Don’t put share objects in the bag though as that will rip it. Great straps, great bag! Actually better than I expected."
"Big enough to carry my 4 man tent, ground cloth and more. I wish it was made of Cordura instead of thin nylon, but nylon is still pretty durable."
This duffel is great.  Large capacity and seems to be well made.  It withstood being checked baggage on a flight with no issues.  The only thing I wish was different was that there were holes in the zipper handles to be able to clip them together to assure they would not slip open during the flight or handling.
"Needed another bag to check, this worked fine for excess clothes, laundry etc. Great price and can’t miss the red color coming off the baggage claim area."
"UPDATE June 2020: I had a mandatory medical trip I took and took along one of my duffels. I found out you CAN lock these duffels. I purchased a set of ""TSA approved Sure Locks"" that are the perfect size to fit in the zipper pull holes. You can find them on Amazon below:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G7V5M17/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_b4o9EbP8NM5ATUPDATE: I finally went on my trip.  I bought a total of four of these duffel bags, but ended up taking three, plus two smaller bags. So far, they traveled in a truck, 2 Ubers, 1 hotel shuttle, 2 airplanes, and thru baggage claim...and a yellow cab and they all made it to Mexico City all intact.  No rips, nada.  I'm impressed.  I've added more photos to show the bags in their original state packed.  They all weighed about 40lbs at the airport.  They were pretty much packed and I'm sure exceeded the checked baggage limit size based on my measurements, but I didn't have to pay any oversize fees at the Delta service desk.  They didn't even look at them twice.  Highly recommend these if for no other reason than a good bag to use for storage.Please note: I stored the shoulder straps of each bag in one of the outside zippered pockets.  That's when I discovered that the fabric (seat belt material) that is made out of the handles actually extends all the way to the bottom of the bag and is double stiched and taped and sewn with a separate piece of nylon, so those handles are hefty.  The whole time I thought they were just sewn to the side of the upper bag because that's all you can see from all the images.  But, when you unzip those exterior pockets you'll see the extra craftsmanship.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Wow!  Very roomy bags.  Upon opening the small boxes they came in, I had my doubts and they initially appeared to be just regular size duffel bags.  But, after I shook one open it expanded to a mega size.I purchased two of these to use as checked bags to transport a LOT of stuff I will need for a 9 month trip.  Mainly a lot of cosmetic bottles,  cleaning supplies, a heater, fan, slow cooker and a lot of other stuff.  I find that no matter where you go having your own cooker, personal fan and heater is necessary, because rooms are either too cold or hot.These bags aren't very cheaply made in my opinion (even though they are made in China).  I thought the nylon was stronger than expected and the zippers are too.All the hardware is metal, not plastic.  Can't wait to use these in 3 months.  I would recommend using bread bag ties to tie the two main zippers together, which is what I do with other pieces of luggage to prevent them separating in transit.Locking any soft sided luggage, in my opinion is a waste.  If someone wanted inside, they just penetrate the zippers or cut the fabric.  But, bread ties work great to lessen the chances of an accidental opening.I update many of my reviews and I will come back and give my 2cents on how they worked out in the wild.  But, there's no reason to give these bags nothing less than 5 stars.Note: I purchased the red color, and it's not fire engine red, but more burgany/maroon in color.  Which is a good thing.I added a photo to show how large these bags are.  I stacked both of mine on top of a Patagonia Black Hole Duffel 120L size.  Look how much bigger the Amazon bags are.  Those120L black hole duffel bags are huge.  People use them to go to Mt Everest base camp.  Hope this photo helps in comparing the size.Before I forget, the only thing I can see Amazon doing to make this bag even more awesome, is adding a shoulder pad to the strap.  I already have several extra pads from other bags that I plan to slide on these existing straps.  I will only be using the straps to move from a taxi to just inside the airport terminal to the checked baggage desk.  So not a biggie."
"This thing is big and it's light. I knew the size dimensions when I ordered it but I was still sort of shocked when I opened it up. It definitely will fit whatever you want to pack. With that in mind, I would only recommend this bag if you are the one handling your bag (i.e. traveling in an automobile). I don't think I'd trust baggage handlers with air travel.The strap is nice, the various pockets (a lot with zippers) are great, and the main zipper seems strong. If you want a very big bag at a very cost-effective price, this is a great option. There are definitely better products out there at much higher prices, but this one gets the job done and doesn't require breaking the bank. Basically, it's a great option to use if it's impractical to use or you don't want to use your traditional suitcase for certain travel or packing needs."
"I needed a big duffle bag that is lightweight and foldable to gather all different types of things that I needed for hospital admission. I didn’t expect much considering the price, but it really exceeded my expectations. It looks very decent, very durable and the materials don’t look cheap. The zippers also look and feels reliable and I love that it has a lot of small pockets. Very handy with this purchase."
Like many reviews here said: it’s made of a great material. It’s big. The straps are strong and finishing are done nicely.

It's thin but it works. Its also very large! Holds lots if things. Not a bad buy at all. It's good for local travelling.
"Its big enough to fit my 54in fairly large tail and wings, hands and my head. All the extra pockets are great for accessories and a balaclava. It’s a bit flimsy but I fully intend to use solely for local travel. Plus it folding up into a smallish bag means I can clip it to my belt."

Bag is decent I've really only used it once for a trip and have it stored in its folded compact form. It's very thin so don't expect a heavy duty bag. Lots of room and good price
This bag was everything I expected. It’s huge! The fabric is very light and thin but it does the job!! And a fantastic price!

Nice and big. Hold lots of stuff and has plenty of pockets. Has a waterproof pocket also. Durable and I love the color.
"I got this for travel.  I used it for a trip to CA.  I really like it.  It's roomier than it looks.  I like how well it fit under the seat in front of me, I still had room for my feet.  I was able to access cord for my phone,  my jacket and pillow easily in flight.  It has an internal wet pocket.  It was easy to carry around after my luggage was checked.  It has a strap/sleeve that fits easily over the handle of my carryon, rides nice on my carryon.  The quality seems good.  Wish it had a more heavy duty zipper but so far it hasn't been an issue.  I would buy this again."
"I absolutely love this bag. It holds more than I anticipated. It is sturdy, easy to clean, stores away easily when not in use. I live that it will ride on top of my suit case securely. Good quality."
"Pro- size. I bought this for a week trip, it was perfect size for flight travel! I was able to put a lot of stuff in here. Also has many pockets with zipper. Strong too. Good bag.Con - it feels heavy to carry and walk around. I expected it lighter since it’s fabric but it is feels heavy even when it’s empty due to waterproof material. But I love the size of bag so I kept it."

This bag is solid! The zipper seems fine, the fabric is durable, the waterproof pocket is great, the shoe storage on the bottom is amazing (holding all three pairs of shoes that I'm going to need on my trip). The trolly strap of your luggage handle is sturdy. The pocket to hold your boarding pass is wonderful. I do wish the very front pocket had a means of securing it, it'll work for a momentary place to set your phone, but I wouldn't keep it there for any length of time as it might either fall out or be snatched up by a slick pickpocket. I don't have any of the unfortunate issues that some have had. I ordered because of there being so few people with problems compared to the total number of bags purchased and high numbers of seriously happy customers. I figured with so many bags sold, there's bound to be a few with issues, but the odds of getting one with problems is low, and with Amazon's easy returns and exchanges, it was worth the risk. No other bag had 31,000+ reviews let alone high number of reviews and high rating. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
"A great travel bag for the weekend or for the gym. It fits a lot, the color is great and the manufacturing is also"
"I bought this bag to put in my suitcase for any gifts and extras I might buy while on vacation. Instead, I used it to replace my backpack. It holds a LOT, has inside and outside pockets, is light weight and strong, has a shoulder strap and shorter carry handles. It has a trolley strap that was really convenient, too.  The price was less than half of the heavily advertised competitor, so I say this bag is a winner.  I'd buy another."
"Absolutely love this duffel bag. The spacious interior makes it perfect for a weekend getaway or a gym session. It’s stylish, durable and sturdy. Love that there is a wide range of colours to choose from and the feature where you could slip it into your carry on luggage."
This bag is cute and Light. Nice for trips to the pool and park etc
"Overall a very nice bag. I bought for a short business trip (3 days) and had plenty of space for everything. Looks good, has a lot of options for carrying and storage, reasonably priced and great for both the gym and short trips.-- Pros --* Flexibility (Carrying): This bag has a lot of options for both carrying. The backpack straps, shoulder strap and carrying handles were all used and appreciated (depending on how far I was walking or what else I was carrying. The straps all have compartments so they can be tucked away (see images).* Flexibility (Storage): There are a number of internal and external compartments, pouches, and a flex space which I used for dirty clothes. The flex space is particularly nice because it could be used as additional expansion if needed by flipping the lining outward (see pics). It's also great for keeping dirty items separate. The side zip pouches are nice to have but they are very small (more on that later).* Durability: Materials are all easy to clean, thick, and sturdy. The zippers are metal, move smoothly with no catching on lose fabric, and the ends sewn into the body so it is unlikely they will ever jump the track.* Appearance: Looks are subjective but I like the color of the light grey and the styling overall. In the listing the bag looks almost white but in person, the color is a bit darker (still a very, very light grey though).-- Cons --* Storage Space: As noted above, there are a lot of compartments. 6 exterior including- 4 side pouches that zip fully- 1 bottom pouch (when used as a backpack) that is adjustable in size and- 1 mesh stretch pouch on the top (when used as a backpack)The minor complaints I have are mainly that all of the zip pouches have very little space and don't stretch or expand much at all. You can't fit much more than some socks, deodorant (see pics), or a few cables/cords/chargers/etc.The mesh pouch on top (in backpack form) does not close or fasten in any way and when used as a backpack the opening is behind you and angled downward (see pics). This means it better be empty when you wear it as a backpack (otherwise it will be empty soon enough...).* Lose Stitching: More of a nit-pick here because overall the construction and quality is great but there were a few loose stiches here and there. Nothing major and easy to snip but one of them on the carrying strap didn't fully tie off so eventually it will unthread itself further. Easy fix for me and doesn't change my general satisfaction with the quality."
"This is exactly what I was expecting for the price and materials.  I really like its style and performance.  Iâ€™ve purchased a few other duffle bags looking for something like this but wasnâ€™t happy them until I came across this. The zipper is smooth, the materials feel well made, the pockets are roomy, and the colors pop.  I recommend this one if you want your moneys worth."
So far it is working well. It is light & time will tell if it is durable. Pleany of room for my needs & enough pockets to separte logically.
"The bag has so much to offer besides the quality. The best part is the separate shoe area which keeps your shoes away from your clothes (and the smell). It has an air hole to help dry out your sweaty shoes if you work out that hard. Also, I used the top area with the stings to put my shower flip-flops in for the water to dry off quickly. Best gym bag ever!!!!!!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I love this bag!It has so many pockets for small things, it's not to big and not small. It holds all my necessary equipment and i can add more if i need. Comfortable handle! And seems to be a good quality bag. I had it for about a month so far, carried 22lbs ankle weights and other things, looks like it's pretty sturdy as well.I didn't try it as a backpack so got nothing to say about that feature."
"The Gym Bag offers plenty of space for all your workout and travel essentials. The separate shoe compartment and anti-theft features are well-thought-out, adding convenience and security. Its water-resistant material is perfect for gym or travel use. Overall, a great bag that combines functionality with ample storage."
Great bag with a lot of pockets for our personal belongings for camping each weekend.  Plenty of storage for bulky items in winter too and zipper seems of good quantity but will have some trips to prove itâ€™s strength.  Overall a good bag.
Good quality with plenty of pockets. Priced fairly but seems a little small when you have the bag fully packed for the gym.
"Big and roomy, folds down compact. Durable material that will hold up and color perfect to picture."
"HAS WO MUCH ROOM, ZIPPER IS STURDY AND QUALITY, THE STYLE INCLUDES A PLACE TO PUT YOUR SHOES, AND PC AND CLOTHES ETC, STYLE IN ITSELF IS REALLY STURDY AND EASY TO CARRY WITH THE SHOULDER STRAP. I WALK ALL OVER DOWNTOWN AND IT HOLDS PERFECTLY. MANY COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM . REALLY DEPENDABLE PRODUCT!"
"This is a decent duffle for the price. It's a bit flimsy and the fabric is pretty thin, but if it lasts a couple years, I'll have gotten my money's worth. I ended up taking a hard flat plastic bottom piece from another duffle and put it in the bottom of this one to make it a bit sturdier, and that helped a lot.I like that it has a separate shoe compartment, although it could have been a bit bigger; my husbands size 12 shoes didn't quite fit, although I was able to squish 2 pair of my smaller sized shoes in there.I liked the variety of colors available and the bluish-green color I got looks nice. It's got lots of compartments for stowing all your stuff and a handy strap to hold it on your suitcase handle."
Like how it goes down to nothing easy to store.  Lightweight.
Even though I picked the larger size and should have gotten a size smaller it still worked out great for what I needed it for. I was able to put everything that I needed in it and still had room left over. The material is sturdy enough but isn't the sturdier material I thought it was going to be. It is a little thinner of material but still is a great bag.
"I received the bag about a month and a half ago, and all was well at first, i can’t complain about how much space it has to carry things, you can fit a lot in it, however a did experience a big problem about 2-3 weeks into using the bag, i would use it for going to the gym because i walk over a mile, i usually walk in crocs because they are comfy for me, but i don’t like working out in them so i bring workout shoes in the bag, as well as other things, the heaviest being a gallon size bottle of water (rarely ever being full when i’m going it the gym) and the second heaviest thing probably being my shoes i was just talking about, and somehow it was enough weight to cause the bag to rip in the bottom, and i was pretty upset as i’m a young man who’s only 18 and don’t really have the money to be buying a 200 dollar bag to ensure it will be able to carry a measly gallon of water, like cmon, a duffel bag can’t carry the weight of gym shoes, a gallon of water, tiny old spice body spray, and a personal umbrella all at once without ripping in the bottom, like the most important part to not rip at cuz all of the items could then fall out if it happens….anyways the bag still does get the job done, i wanted something to carry items from point A to point B, I can indeed get that done, and it isn’t uncomfortable or anything, as i said i walk over a mile to the gym and back home with this thing around my shoulders and i have no problem with the comfortability of it, looks nice even, black goes with every outfit in my opinion, it even has a compartment that i would assume is for keeping things cooled, which is where i kept my gallon of water…I actually kept using the bag after the big rip incident of 24’ because as i said i need something to get my stuff to the gym, but one day on my way home from the gym i got chipotle and i put the bag of chipotle inside the duffel bag (not the smartest idea) and when i got home I came to find out the inside of the black duffel bag turned white from sour cream ☹️☹️☹️ ever since i haven’t used the bag and i’m really only leaving this review to tell you all not to carry chipotle in the bag and not to carry a gallon of water in it or else it will rip on you 💔"
Great travel bag or just as a gym bag. It’s spacious but not bulky and very easy to carry
"The duffel bag is extremely large perfect to be a football duffel bag storage capacity is extremely large. It’s durable. It has a couple of extra pockets plus it comes with a small personal hygiene bag, which is perfect for football players because they need that and it has an end for you can open and put something in where it can’t get dirty, or you can put your stuff in there. I sure enough will buy another one if my grandson needs another one and it’s waterproof the water just bubbles off of it. Great news for football players."
"When I first received this bag in the small box I got it in I was a bit confused wondering if they sent me the correct item. As I unboxed the item I realized that this duffel bag actually can be folded up and more compact for easy storage in the future which I love by the way.  The quality seems very nice and the bag seems to be made pretty durable so I had to test it, when I unfolded it out of its compacted shape my cat decided that it was a good place to sleep so I grabbed my cat and put him in the bag left it unzipped and picked it up to see if it can hold him. ( he is rather chunky ) It seems to do well and it was lightweight even with him inside. So I did another test I am going on vacation soon so I jammed all the stuff I was going to pack and it all fit :)"
This is a good medium sized bag for its price
As a football referee I use this bag to carry my gear. The 65 liter bag contains everything and has even spare room. Having a separate compartment for the shoes is just perfect since I don't soil my clothes with dirt and odors. The mini bag is just perfect to carry small accessories so you don't lose them in the large bag. The only negative is that the fabric is very light so the bag itself is very soft and barely hold itself. Seems look quite sturdy so it should last for a while. Not the best bag I had but a good bag for the price.
This thing caught me off guard. I thought I was buying like a small filler bag that I would use possibly occasionally. I find this thing to be my go to almost all the time. Excellent zipper! Excellent handles! Great size for small amount of goods without feeling like you’re carrying way too big of a bag.
"Nice bag. Its bigger than it looks. Seems durable. Used it on a 2 week trip, so far so good"
"Nice and roomy, seems well put together. Just what I was looking for."
So impressed with the quality of this duffel bag!
"The bag size is as described, and the handles on both ends are convenient. However, it only has one zipper pocket."
I got this for my husband as a general use bag. It was surprisingly rugged and just all around tough. Although I shouldn't have been surprised as Carhartt really is a good name. It was well constructed and has held up quite well to being overstaffed and slightly abused as his day-to-day life can be a little hectic. It's also holding up to the crazy weather that we have been having. You really can't go wrong with the name Carhartt. I would definitely recommend this whether it's for yourself or a gift as you should get years of use out of this bag.
Used the bag once and the button broke on the handle.  I don’t recommend on purchasing because the quality is low even though it has the Carhartt brand.
I ordered this product in a size 60L four times from different ads and different colours and received the 25L each time. I do not think the 60L exists!!That being said said - the bags are carhart quality and appear to be very durable.
There is no way to rate the seller as the seller is Amazon.ca. I ordered this product 4 times and received the wrong size every time. I ordered the 60L and received the 25L every-time - Buyer beware! Overall the product is nice and of Carhartt quality but it is a pain that when ordering a 60L size and receiving the wrong size every time even after speaking with a customer service rep and they guaranteed I would receive the correct size the next time I ordered it. WRONG!
"Simple duffel bag, but has the Carhartt quality and feel. Great space for use, nice straps, and sturdy construction, and is great for moving a ton of stuff"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Did not like how my order was wrong ordered 60l received 25l Whats going on I want my 60l"
This is the second time Carhart sent me the wrong bag. It’s frustrating
I love the size and quality of this duffel bag. It is very lightweight. I was able to fit a lot of clothes in here. It is great for a carry-on. The designs are simple and have lasted me 20 days on my trip.
