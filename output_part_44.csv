These are actually seamless and very comfortable
Not what I expected from this brand. I‚Äôm returning customer but these recent ones are just flimsy. Not my favorite. I think they would get worn out too easily.
"I keep purchasing these! My go-to white socks. They are thick and comfy, but still breathable.They hit at the right height so they're cutie cute. I even caught myself doing a little happy dance in them ‚Äì they're that comfy!!!"
"Comfortable and utilitarian, no frills about them. Good quality and reliable."
"These socks are comfortable, and fir well."
"Great socks, as expected. Good quality. Will purchase again when it’s time!"
My kids love them !!! Good quality.  Will purchase more.  Fast shipping
"Great, I use it all the time. Amazing!"
All the hype is Nike socks. My son loves these for football practice. They are comfortable and have great quality. Black is the perfect color so you can’t see the dirt and grass stains for practice!
My 13 yr old son loves these socks
my daughter likes them.
"Very good quality and value for money , they wash really well too"
Quality product at good price.
A must buy very comfortable and I bought them in black too.
Item was as advertised
"These on-pointe, white socks by Hue are just about the softest socks I have ever put myself into. They are true to size and the price on Amazon is cheaper than at Marshall‚Äôs‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"It‚Äôs a comfortable, perfect for your samba addidas or wearing them over your leggings. They last a long time and I like that‚Äôs there‚Äôs no logo on the sides."
"Super squishy, crisp white colored, sturdy socks! So far, they have been sequential to my morning wardrobe dress attire. As a millennial, I am well acquainted with crew socks. Now, in the mid 2000‚Äôs I do remember these socks (anything that wasn‚Äôt no show) were very much ‚Äòlooked down upon‚Äô‚Äî thus I remember being bullied for still having mine. Which has now turned me into a no show sock QUEEN. I have a vast array of different types. Now that I have a 9 yr old daughter, she has let me know that I should show my socks! ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid! Let those puppies out!‚Äù I said I‚Äôd love to but I have nothing to show.Then, we looked through all crew socks. These were the ones that hit all of my daughter‚Äôs marks. AND LET ME TELL YOU, these have me loving them again. YES I SAID IT. Tell Becky from 2nd grade that I‚Äôm not afraid of her antics, and I am PROUD to wear them again. Live. Laugh. Wear crews. Live your dreams. Frick bullies. Forget Becky‚Äôs. Long live the crew."
Perfect fit & super comfy but the colored ones seem to get more pilling. I have a pack of just white & this colored pack & none of the white have a pilling issue
Really cute sock with any white shoe. With durable thick material.
"Love these. Perfect fit. When you buy socks online, you‚Äôre pretty much gambling on if they‚Äôre going to be good quality (same with everything else).  These socks are great! Tight enough to wear I don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôll get lost in my shoe, but not so tight to cause discomfort."
I love these socks!  I‚Äôve bought so many socks that either don‚Äôt stay up or cut my circulation off!  These stay up but don‚Äôt cut into your leg.  Perfect length too!  Don‚Äôt be surprised when you first get them.  They look small but actually fit great!  Lightweight but perfect padding in the sole.  Very comfy for my walks and treadmill.
"This is my second time purchasing these socks, not because they wore out but because I lose socks. I have the black ones and they hold the color well. I‚Äôve had the first purchase for almost a year and they wear well, no holes like other brands at a similar price point. These have cotton and are breathable yet warm enough for winter, great for those of us who don‚Äôt like the feel of knee high socks."
"I‚Äôm impressed by the quality of this. Perfect size, comfortable. It‚Äôs my favourite."
These are very comfy
"Nothing to complain about, they‚Äôre exactly as described and good quality. They‚Äôre not too thick so your feet aren‚Äôt being squeezed into your shoes, but definitely not for super cold days where you need your feet kept warm. Just average everyday socks which is what I needed!"

"I mean socks are socks, these meet the bill of goods.The height is just above the ankle.Not terribly thick, but they work for daily wear. I'd expect to replace these  within the next 12 to 18 months. My last set lasted 6 months. So these are good quality.Maybe I'm too rough on socks, but man's got to work to love these days.Haven't slipped in these socks so far.Thin, not super warm.Strechiness is fine, they snug up nicely."
"I like these socks, they're comfortable and they fit well. Only problem is they get holes in them very easily but other than that they're solid."
"These socks are great. They fit perfect on my big feet, i wear 10 in women's 8.5 men's, they're soft & stretchy. Even as my legs swell through the day these are not cutting off my circulation & the ankle height is perfect for my work boots. They look sharp, mostly solid black, they also don't roll down & feel like their actually durable. We'll see as time goes on but i feel like i won't wear holes into these like i do with the thinner socks."
"Cheap, and comfortable."
Comfortable for everyday wear
Last a while but will fall apart after an average amount of wear
Trusted brand and comfortable.
"Very comfortable, good price, fits well, decent quality"
I bought this exact brand and type of sock 5 years ago and they're still going strong. I'm only replacing ones that escaped from the laundry. Unbelievably good quality and very comfortable and warm. I also love they are simply black with no pattern. The ankle length is perfect and quite hard to find in UK retail shops (which normally only stock short or crew length socks).
"These socks are wonderful. They fit my foot perfectly, snug but never tight. This calf-length never falls down, or bunches up under my foot. The extra cushioning support is excellent, and they are comfortable in all my shoes -- dress, sneaker, or casual loafer. The multi-color mix here goes with a wide range of my dress or casual clothes -- suits or jeans -- the colors are vivid and rich. The material is very well-woven and offer a lot of support, but they are not excessively thick, nor do they encourage sweating. For the price is is an excellent choice, and I will buy the other offered color ranges."
"These socks fit snug, feel so comfortable, don't fall down, look great and  keep  my feet warm without  sweating."
"very attractive, extremely comfortable, and appear to be very long lasting socks. my pair ran small but they were too nice to return so i gifted them to my wife. :-)"
"The socks were made of quality material. They are very comfortable and dyer several washings, tend to hold their original shape. I like the style and patterns of the material. Very good value for the money."
"I am so impressed with the quality, feel and fit. I find them to work extremely well with my work boots. These feel so comfortable. These allow my feet to breathe, not get sweaty with workouts and these don't shift around when I wear around the house. I went back and ordered another set. These will hold up nicely."
nice fit and comfortable
Liked durabilityTop of sock squeezes my calf
"The quality isn’t what I expected. They are very soft and cushion is good, but the top of one of the pairs started coming apart and they have only been worn once and haven’t even been washed yet."
"I recently tried the Alvada Men's Merino Wool Crew Socks during my hunting trips, and they have quickly become my go-to socks!What I Loved:Incredible Warmth: These socks do an amazing job of keeping my feet warm in chilly weather. The merino wool provides excellent insulation without feeling bulky.Comfortable Fit: The crew length fits perfectly, providing ample coverage without slipping down. They feel soft against my skin and offer great cushioning.Moisture-Wicking: I appreciate how well these socks wick away moisture. Even after a long day outdoors, my feet stay dry and comfortable, which is crucial when hunting.Durable Construction: The quality of the material is evident. After several washes and wears, they have held up beautifully without losing their shape or softness.Versatile Use: While I primarily use them for hunting, they are also great for hiking and everyday wear during colder months.Overall Impressions:The Alvada Men's Merino Wool Crew Socks are a fantastic investment for anyone spending time outdoors in the cold. They keep my feet warm and dry, providing the comfort I need for long days in the field. I highly recommend these socks to fellow hunters and outdoor enthusiasts!"
"These socks are so good. They’re super comfortable. They hold up well in the wash they don’t slide around in your shoe, which is a big issue for me and I end up with scrunched toes and it’s super uncomfortable. They are very warm socks for cold weather. The size is great they’re stretchy so if the fit is a little snug at first, they do loosen up after a short period of time. They are fantastic for cold weather and lounging around the house out house slippers on they’re not too heavy so they travel well. Honestly I love these socks. 10/10 would recommend."
"I’m really impressed with these grey wool crew socks! They’re soft, warm, and comfortable, making them perfect for cold weather. The wool fabric is breathable yet insulating, and the fit is snug without being too tight. They’re easy to get on and off. But I do love how they stay in place all day, and they’re durable enough to handle outdoor activities. These socks have quickly become my go-to for both everyday wear and outdoor adventures in the winter, not bulky i can wear them with my converse.Highly recommend for anyone looking for cozy, high-quality socks!"
"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to brand name wool socks. They lasted decently well for the price point and kept my feet toasty. At the time of use, I worked 10-12 hour days outdoors on my feet ALL day, hiking through rugged terrain. They held up for months of daily use and I was really impressed with the quality. On rainy days or when working in creek beds, my boots and feet would be soaked but stayed decently warm. After about 4-5 months of regular use all of my pairs had holes in the heels. Nonetheless, the quality and warmth they provide is great for the price point - especially if you're not quite ready to pull the trigger on brand name wool socks."
Today it is 2• below zero wind chill.  Actual temperature is 8. A great test for these great socks. My feet are toasty warm. The socks fit well and are not scratchy and not too thick for my footwear.  So pleased with my purchase.
"I love to run and was looking for socks to keep my feet warm when it was cold.  I tried a couple of ""running warm socks,"" that did not really do the trick.  These absolutely do and for a great price!  They are super soft and comfy too.  They are a little tight in my running shoes, but exactly what I was looking for!"
Socks were of high quality and warm.  Thick socks.
"My feet are always cold, especially at night, and these socks keep my feet incredibly warm.  They fit and feel great.  I wear them at night when I sleep.  They are thick and won't work with my regular shoes, but that doesn't matter to me as long as my feet are warm at night.  These socks are awesome!  Thank you for an excellent product, and it's priced right too.  Thank you also for men's socks in the larger sizes.  I got my husband some socks too and he wears a size 16 shoe and these socks come in this size.  To be able to get these socks in his size (14-16) at this prize is amazing.  Thank you so much."
"I ordered 3 brands of wool blend socks and these. Out of the four, these were by far superior-warmer, more breathable and better cushioning. I get cold feet easily, and these really help. These are great socks at the price, and if I hadn’t work]n the others I would have returned them. Highly recommended!"
"I love these! They are comfy, affordable,thick, non slip, good fitting, cotton, durable, not easily torn, low cut styled socks!!!"
"These socks are really comfortable and the material is breathable so my feet don't get sweaty.  I have a 9 1/2 foot, so I bought the larger size.  These are the perfect fit and they are stitched so that there isn't a lot of bulk or excess material at the toes."
"I just got these socks and I had to come write a review right away after I tried them. They feel so good!! Different. Not sure what it is but I love them. They fit perfect, they feel soft, at same time they are thick at the bottom but breathable. They are excellent."
Affordable and great durability
These socks  were purchased to replace socks with a  similar polyester/cotton blend.  They were more comfortable after being washed and dried but not as comfortable as other socks I have purchased.
"Breathable, thick but comfortable. Amazing quality and style. Fit to size"
Made very well. Washes up great. Comfortable and functional
Great fit and comfort. So far teo washings and very happy - no holes or issues wiil update if issue
I have been wearing these since I received them. They are really comfortable.
"Gotta love a reliable product.  Keep coming back to Hanes for these.  Perfect fit, and most importantly, they don't slip down into my shoes throughout the day.  I recommend."
Love the socks. Fit nicely and not to thin but also not too thick either so all good things
"Comfortable, not too thick or thin and the right height- exactly what I was looking for. I’m a bit on the tall side and lots of women’s pants are made so short. I hate having my ankles out because I feel like it looks silly and it’s cold too so these help with the look and keep me warm. I’m glad I got them because they were a lot lower-priced than socks at most stores. They’ve held up well so far too."
These socks are well made and very soft. I wear a size 7 shoe and find it hard to find socks that fit. Usually only 9-11 are offered and are too big. These are offered in size 6-8 and 9-11. Fit is  perfect!. Love the colors and patterns offered. Will but more at this price.
"I am pleased with these thin, but not too thin dress crews. They are comfortable at the toe and the material feels good. They stretch enough and feel good on your feet. The socks do not slide around either. They are a good value for the money. I hope I helped you decide on your next pair of inexpensive but quality dress crews. Happy shopping."
I was looking for thin socks and these are thicker than I wanted - but I still like them.  They are soft and launder well (cool wash and low heat dryer).  I like the variety of the package I got - some had cute patterns.  My only complaint is that these are tight on my ankles (and I don't have thick ankles).
"Super socks for tennis shoes or boots. Excellent deal, and in my fave color, black!"
