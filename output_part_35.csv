"The bag is good value, I can fit everything I use at the gym in it including my weight belt (not leather and folds flat), knee sleeves, bands, wrist wraps, lift straps etc. It’s got 2 dedicated zipper pockets, one on the outside and one on the inside which I use for my headphones and keys. It would also make a great travel gym bag due to its ability to compress down.Unfortunately there’s absolutely no sturdiness in the bag, and there’s no “bottom” that keeps it rigid and preventing the bag from folding in on itself when carrying. This is good if you’re traveling but is a con if you’re just going to a local gym with it. There’s also probably not room for a change of clothes/shoes along with your gym equipment so I wouldn’t recommend this as a work gym bag.Overall it’s useful for what I use it for and is small enough to bring with me to all the equipment I go to in the gym without putting it into a locker."
"I needed a smaller duffle bag and this one is nice quality and works for what I needed. I do wish it had pockets on the ends like the larger bags I have, but it’s still good"
"My old sack came apart carrying my music stuff (folding stand, harmonicas, page turner, IPad, etc). This bag easily fits all the stuff and provides easy carry and access. Good value for the money."
"This duffel bag fits a lot- I use it for hauling picnic stuff, sun shade, blanket, etc.  Zipper works fine. Compact/foldable.  Handles are sewn on securely but are not meant to support super heavy loads."
"Went for a weeklong trip to Europe with this bag as my carry on and had room to spare for gifts and souvenirs on the way back. Was worried about quality, but the bag held together nicely. Zippers work well. It's very thin and packs away well, which would also make it ideal as a day pack or just a spare bag to pack in your suitcase."
"Great bag and quality, but no shoulder strap really limits its usefulness."
"I've looked quite a bit for the proper bag to put my very thick yoga mat in, but most sacks zipper from the side, making it impossible to fold my mat into.  it was nice to find this sack that zippers from the end."
Perfect for gym or overnight.
yeah its fine its not bad
"Very nice carry on bag with lots of compartments and pockets.  Beautiful color.  A lot bigger than expected. Definitely have plenty of room for a lot of things.  Cute toiletry bag with plenty of room. Really like the shoe separate compartment. The adjustable strap should make it easy to carry.  Even though I got the creme/ ivory color,  I think it will be easy to clean.  I ordered this for a trip the next day, and received the same day.  Recommend this bag!It made it through the trip without a single stain!! :)"
"I bought this bag to use along with my carry-on luggage. I saw it mentioned in an article and found it on Amazon. Now that I have one, I can't say enough good things. It's well made and completely lined. It has the bottom zip-out area that I can use for extra clothes or for packing extra golf gear--anything that won't break when the bag is set down or dropped. The inside main pocket is very roomy, has a zipped plastic-lined area for wet clothes, and there are all sorts of other inside pockets. I also like the multiple outside pockets for water bottle, phone, etc. The bag is big, but not so large that it can't be stuffed under the seat in front of you. Plus it comes in lots of colors, is set up to add a phone charger, has a shoulder strap and a separate, small zipper bag that can be used for oh so many things."
"This is a good bag for a few days of a trip, but here are a few things:Pros:Lots of pockets and spaceI like the separate shoe storage and the extra mini bags that come with thisEasy to Pack, solid zippersCons:-Once you put your shoes in, this thing keeps toppling over. I cannot get it to sit flat when I put it down on the ground. If you don't care about this, then it's fine. But I don't really like having my bag lay on its side because it cant stay upright-shoe space actually takes up a lot of the capacity. The part of the bag used for putting your clothes+ in holds a lot less than a duffel bag of a similar sizeOverall, I like this bag but I think i'd prefer a regular duffel and a bag for my shoes instead. It is definitely nice you can slip it over your carryon bag though."
"This bag is durable, great in size, easy to clean, super cute color. It has a build in show holder and a waterproof pocket on the inside! Rip resistant is a huge plus! The versatility is great you can use it for every day items or as a gym bag!"
"It had just the right amount of pockets for me. Easy to organize and find things. Excellent travel bag because it fits under the seat. The pad on the shoulder strap keeps it comfortable. and has a strap fits over the handles of my carry-on for when my shoulder gets tired.The bottom shoe compartment is convenient, but it is flimsy and unstable. I cut out a piece of hard foam in the shape of the bottom to give it more form And that works great."
"I purchased a medium-sized beige one for travel, and it‚Äôs been fantastic! It‚Äôs well-made, sturdy, and has a stylish design. The multiple pockets make it super convenient and keep everything organized. I‚Äôm extremely happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!"
"The ETRONIK Gym Bag for Women is not only perfect for the gym but also great as a carry-on for travel! It‚Äôs spacious, with a separate compartment for shoes and wet items, and fits easily under the seat or in the overhead bin. The durable yet lightweight design, multiple pockets, and water-resistant lining make it super practical for trips. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a versatile bag."
"This bag hardly has an structure to it. There is nothing keeping the top portion of the bag from collapsing into the bottom part. Side pockets can not hold and support a water bottle. Inside pocket folds inward when I put my cellphone in it. The picture of the product is deceiving because this bag does not stand up on its own, it callaspes into crumpled up mess. Not ideal for a gym bag, best used for an overnight bag if you have no intention of using the side pocket or inside pocket to hold anything that has little weight to it. Overall I do not recommend."
"I recently got the ETRONIK Gym Bag, and it has been a game changer for my workouts! This bag is spacious enough to hold all my gym essentials, and the dedicated shoe compartment is a fantastic feature that keeps everything organized and separate.The design is stylish and practical, with multiple pockets that make it easy to find my items. The material feels durable, and the straps are comfortable for carrying, whether I‚Äôm heading to the gym or traveling.Overall, I highly recommend the ETRONIK Gym Bag for anyone looking for a functional and chic duffel bag. It‚Äôs perfect for workouts, travel, or weekend getaways!"
"This bag is perfect for my travels. It has a space at the bottom for shoes, a separate bag for whatever items you need to keep together and it's sturdy but light. Highly recommended"
Absolutely love this bag perfect for weekend trips and has lots of pockets to store varying items. Love the durability and good quality!
"Great size! Easy to use and perfect for work, gym, short trip"
"Very sturdy and nicely made! Zipper good, roomy, high value for money!"
"Wow, this is beyond my expectation, I'm so happy with it.  I wanted to get a little duffle to fit on top of my smaller carryon luggage for an international trip.  This would be used to carry all the extra stuff that I want close at hand at my seat, and this can easily be shoved under the seat.  I can also put my purse in here too just so that I'm not managing too many things.  The material is a very high end looking canvas, not thin nylon or thick army issue so it's sturdy enough but not flimsy.  It's got unisex styling!  Size to true, this fits right on top of my luggage without any spill over.  If I find something I like, I go back and buy more and I submit a 5 STAR review for this!  Zippers are well made and the shoulder strap is a plus.  I'm not a backpack person either when I travel!  (When on the move, my purse/wallet will be under my shirt!)"
"SImple, but good smaller sized bag (fits a typical towel, flip flops, water bottle and misc).  Quality seems good (used for 1 month).  Outside pocket is very small, not big enough for a cell phone.  Inner pocket is good size and could fit phone."
My son needed a duffel bag for his gym clothes. He brings them home every week for washing and this bag is the perfect size. Everything fits and its not too bulky. He isn't easy on his things and it has held up beautifully.
Fits more than you would think. Zipper is durable and doesn‚Äôt get caught. Reasonably priced. I spilt coffee on it and it beaded right off.
Nice size but handle broke off the first time it was used.
"Very durable, easy cleaning fabric, strap is wide and very durable, perfect color, plenty of pockets,the portability is great, performance is perfect for cheer, workout, great for travel caryon"
I love the size of this bag and it makes for a perfect gym bag; it fits the essentials and also packs easily into a locker.  It seems to be well made and the two zipped pockets are useful for keys and other essentials.
"I bought this bag for my brother a couple of months ago and the quality was as shown in the photos. Now, i decided to buy for myself and the bag i received is not the same as the one i ordered for my brother.The quality is rubbish, it feels like paper, the bag does not sit straight and when you put things inside it, it does not hold. Save yourself money and don‚Äôt buy.I‚Äôm guessing they have changed suppliers and the quality is absolutely horrible. The brand name is not even on the zippers as it is on my brothers bag.I will be returning my bag."
"This is a big duffle bag, not the most expensive. Will be good for our trip, however, if we traveleda lot I am not sure how it will hold up. Thinner material, but we will see how it does."
It’s big and the material is great and it has wheels and take as many as you want .. very light weighted and good for travel
"This bag is an upgrade from another basic bag I was considering. Very spacious interior, wheels very helpful. I packed at 50 lbs weight.  I bought 2. One tore during the trip and I threw it anway and the other made it back home with a torn handle. Not major issue for me as the bag has several handles. Definitely worth the price. If you fill to capacity for a checked bag, they will be a single use item."
Very roomy. Sturdy material.Can fit contents of two suitcases inside.
"Good product, the most economic way to avoid buying expensive luggage, not very sturdy, but accomplish the mission. you can travel with it folded inside your other luggage and used it as another item in your checked-in bagagge. Would be great with better quality straps, but you're getting what you are paying for."
"I fly to events from time to time, and I don't want to have to check an empty bag to make sure I can bring things home, so for me this is perfect. It fits into my carry on bag (along with a long weekend worth of clothes and a change of shoes), and then I can throw my clothes or light, non-fragile items in it and check it for the flight home.So far it has survived several flights with no problems, including one where I honestly probably overloaded it with board games.It's inexpensive, so it certainly has a finite lifespan, but I've already gotten my money's worth out of it and will continue to use it until it falls apart."
The first time we used this suitcase the zipper broke. Had to bring it to airport taped up and have them place in plastic bag for travel. This is outside the one month return window so we have no recourse. So frustrating!!
The wheels feel a little heavy some I’m kind of mixed about what I think. Over great quality
"The duffel is very large, but lighter than you would expect, It does not have a frame along the bottom to the wheels so if you are packing it loosely you likely wont be able to roll it well.  But i got it on a great sale at the time so Its a solid purchase that I dont regret. I can imagine it holding about a weeks worth of clothes and belongings.  The zipper on top is large and easy to access things, but the hand grab handle seems a tad short when loaded, but comes with a shoulder strap slightly padded, with thicker plastic clips.Great value to me at sale price for sure. Suits my needs well!"
The size was almost right for what we intended to use the bag for.We just had to pad it out ourselves.Yet to test its sturdiness with travelling to make sure it does not tear as easily as the other bag we used to have.
Bought for my husbands work trip and he loved it. Thankful for the pockets. Rugged and just good quality. Would definitely recommend
I bought this for my husband because he travels out of town for work in construction. He loves it! Said the outside pockets are padded or the way it was made is really nice. He said he puts his phone charger in one of the small outside pockets and you can’t even feel there’s anything in the pocket. So he feels like he things won’t get damaged.
Perfect for my husband who works outdoors and needs to bring a change of clothes with him. It also fits his medicine and diabetes supplies.
"This duffel bag is STRONG AND DURABLE, and it houses all of your essentials with lots of room inside of it sizing no matter what the particular purchaser uses it for and matter what the intended use is for it has strong stitching and is put together with sturdy sewing so this will last a while depending on how it is used by the personal uses of it and perhaps if  it is used correctly ,a lengthy duration of use, Definitely a strong buy for the money and would recommend to other AMAZON shoppers who like nice craftsmanship and good strong materials for their bags ."
Bought this bag to replace my overnight bag. I have several other Carhartt bags and they have stood up over several years of use.
It made it through 4 flights and its still like new.
I bought this for my son to use as a diaper bag for his daughter. It's perfect!
My traveling son needed an upgrade from an old backpack for weekend trips.  This duffle did the trick!  Great value for money.
It has a lot of space for all my clothes and the extra little pockets inside are amazing for extra room. The pockets outside of the bag are also very useful when it comes to smaller things like chargers!
"I was impressed with the one I had bought for my boyfriend. We have been using it for over a year, now he uses it when he goes away to work. It’s taken the place of his suit case. I had to buy my own lol. Great Bang for my buck."
This bag is perfect for my job in construction fits everything I need for my job and the compartments are great for having even thing organized
"Based on the description, I was expecting a bag with the material weight of canvas or heavy duty canvas, this bag is fairly average."
"I am replacing my outdoor research duffle that I had for over 20 years. The new bag is even better than the last one because it has a large u shaped opening for the main enclosure, two large pockets at each end, a rectangular shape, and one smaller pocket on the front side. It is the perfect duffle. The new bag also has a more comfortable strap and handles. Just a note: I had to replace my old bag because I overstuffed it, and broke the zipper. It was a user error, not from poor quality. It had been to multiple countries, and spent the past few years as the main gear bag for snowboarding gear. It’s washable, and highly durable."
"So I've been in the market for a medium sized duffle for car camping for some time.  I've been using the round single zipper type duffle bag from REI for the past year.  While that bag is very rugged the organization inside the bag is very poor.  The zipper doesn't open fully to see the content inside and it's difficult to separate gear.I went into REI to check out some bags they have there.  My favorite was the REI 65L Tech Beast duffle (it's the closest in size to this medium duffle).  While it was really awesome at $90 it was a little expensive for a duffle that would be used for car camping and weekend trips.  Not to mention, the 65L didn't have a separate compartment for shoes.  I would have to get the 100L bag for that, which was more expensive and way to big for my needs.I picked this up on sale and was expecting it to be cheap and flimsy.  I was defiantly surprised when opened it up and saw that the bag is made out of a thicker canvas type material.  There is a lot of double stitching, including the strap area.  The organization of the bag is pretty good, and it has a cavernous opening to be able to see all the contents of the main compartment which helps me to keep my gear organized and not mess stuff up when I grab a change of clothes out of it.  Granted this bag is not the same quality, and lacks a few features of say the REI tech duffle, but for the price I'll try this guy out for the year and buy a nicer bag when I get some extra cash.I'd say this size would be best for trips under a week long.  4-5 days is my typical camping trip length and I've been able to fit all my clothes, extra jacket, toiletries, camping towel, and a pair of hiking boots in this without issue."
"sturdy bag, holds our heavy duty ski gear. also comes with a smaller zippered bag inside which is great for toiletries."
"Lots to like about this bag.  I have it in several sizes, the Large is closer to the size of a big gym bag, the X-Large is as big as many hockey bags.  It has side pockets for shoes or boots or things you want to separate from the main compartment.  It has a small outside pocket that can hold maps or paperwork and when unzipped  on the XL it fits a coaching clipboard rather well.  It has a collapsible carrying bag that can be used on its own.  It has carrying straps that go completely around to the other side, good zippers and quality stitching.  It is fairly durable and holds up to normal wear and tear.The only downside is that it is not indestructible.  Airlines and sharp skates are able to cut the nylon fabric.  I have been really satisfied with the performance for what it is.  That having been said, I am still looking for the holy grail of bags to protect my pack from the airlines when traveling.  I thought I had it in the XL.  After seeing the abuse that this bag has taken at their hands, I can only imagine how many straps and buckles I would have to replace if I had not had it as a first layer of protection for my pack.  If I have to buy one of these every couple of years to protect my pack, I would still consider it a good investment.  In the meantime, let me know if you find something a bit sturdier."
I was looking for a large duffle with side pockets.  Most of the ones I found were too small - more like a large gym bag than a travelling one.  This one fit the bill.  The side pockets are large too - large enough to fit my size 15 hiking shoes and still have the other pocket left over for other items.  The side pockets do not take up additional space inside the duffle (like many gym bags) so there is PLENTY of room for everything.
"The size of the bag was perfect. The outer material seemed sturdy and zippers worked well. An extra zippered bag comes inside. Overall, the bag seemed to meet my needs, however on day 2 of using it, the interior pocket seam ripped. The bag was not overpacked. I think the interior is just made poorly. If you used this for very light use, it might be ok, but I don't recommend it for travel."
Fantastic bag for traveling perfect for taking items that are not fragile. Easy to fold when you arrive in your destination and doesn’t take space at all perfect perfect perfect highly recommended and very strong product so far I have purchased three of these.
Good quality. Nice duffel.
I love the quality and roominess !
"This is a high quality bag for the price. Very nice material and seems very well made. It is lightweight, yet sturdy. The bag is not rigid, but holds its shape well when packed. The straps are a nice thick but soft, flexible material. The zipper is very nice as well. I use this bag for packing clothes for camping trips. It is a good size for a weekend trip."
"This bag is perfect for my needs. Love the color! Great material that makes for easy cleaning. Upon purchase, I did have to air it out for several weeks because the material was off gassing with a moderate chemical smell, but afterwards, it was good to go. I also like the inside pockets and storage. The only other downside was that the bag closes in an odd way where the ends raise up on the corners, so it's not straight across like a regular duffle bag."
"There is a lot of smaller pockets and larger sections to store things, it I'd a material that easy to wipe out, similar to rain jackets.  The color and design is exactly as shown and the two strap types make it very easy to carry around! However, my only complaint is that if you put anything in the inside mesh pockets taller than the side of the pocket, it just tips over and falls out into the bag because the pocket has no support. None of the bag actually has supports, so it doest stay up, or open, and things tend to get all mixed together because the inside pockets don't close, but that means there is way more space to shove things in! And it holds well to being stuffed full, the zipper holds shut"
Nice little bag for babies essentials while traveling. Pockets inside were a nice surprise as well! Handles are study as well for the cheap price.
"I needed a weekender bag on a recent trip. I was able to get next day delivery. For the price I paid, I am pleasantly surprised at how durable and spacious this bag was. It fit all of my items and then some. I was able to easily carry and travel with it and connect it to my carry on. The extra internal and external pockets were an added bonus. Again, for the price, this was a steal. Very satisfied."
"I needed a cheap all-black duffle bag, and I am blown away by the quality of this bag! It has pockets inside and out and heavy-duty straps. I'll probably buy more just because of the quality vs. the price. Great packaging also makes it perfect for gift-giving. You can't beat the price."
Light and roomy and sturdy loving it
"Use this for travel for 4 days, fit everything no problem, great buy!"
I ordered these shorts for my dad for his birthday and he loved them. The size is true to size and for the price it's a very good product.
