"I purchased these lighters after getting fed up with using multiple windproof matches just to light a portable cooking stove. Instead, I invested in these two lighters to take the place of matches and free up some space in my pack. Since it came with two, I was able to put one in a survival kit in my truck and the other in my hunting equipment.The electrical lighter has a distinctive ""cool"" factor going for it with the pink crisscross lightning bolts that it has for the ignition mechanism. It's nice that it can be recharged as well. The butane lighter is pretty standard.Both of these are weather resistant and work great!"
"Wow, these are terrific. I smoke cigars, and we do adventure motorcycling - so I bought these as compact lighters that are water resistant. I haven't tested the water resistance, but I think for the price, you have to cut some slack - although I'll say, they appear VERY solid and will resist water nicely. Everything about the construction and quality is really good-  AND, I was very pleased the USB lighter works great for cigars. The 'window' where the electric current runs is quite small (seems designed for a cigarette) but I've had no issues at all lighting up my stogies, really great design. The butane came empty, but local cigar shop sold me a canister and super easy to fill!  The butane flame is powerful and just really really pleased with both of these, I'll carry both and butane will be backup if USB runs out of power/fails."
"Great little arc lighter, but I wish that the cap could either come off or folded further back. It’s nearly impossible to light a candle with it because the lid is open at a 45° angle so the arc can’t reach the wick."
"Bought these for kayaking and camping, easier to use since they are windproof. Better than matches."
"I like how they feel in my hand, smooth and light. They have a locking mechanism to keep top on. I tried the electric (arching light), and it started a fire on paper and burned it.  Good to have on hand.  I haven’t tried the fuel one yet because I need to buy fuel to fill it up. So, I’m sure it will work just as well!"
"I really like the USB arc lighter, it's pretty reliable and it will certainly start fire if you need it to. The butane lighter only ignites when the celestial conditions are just right. In other words, you might get it to light on the first click, or the 50th. Not exactly what you want if you've crashed your car in the country in the middle of winter and you're trying to start a fire to stay warm."
I have used these for back country camping on 2 trips so far and they work great. I'm ordering a second set for my GO-bag.
"These lighters are pretty cool.  The arc lighter is interesting.  I have never used one before, but it started out fire with ease.  I have not tested whether they are water proof yet, but the case design is solid.  I like the lanyards that come with both lighters. I lose stuff a lot, so it is nice to be able to hang them around my neck while setting up camp.  Great value and works well."
No more wind blowing out
Product works good. Easy to use. I use it to light my cigarettes while riding my motorcycle.

Super lightweight, I love how fuzzy and warm it is. The black color pairs great with so many different things. Easy to pack and fold up to bring with you. Quality is great, I got this my first year learning to snowboard and took some mean falls and it still held up perfectly lol. It‚Äôs functional, fits multiple helmets. Super easy to wash and it doesn‚Äôt tear to pieces after washing. Will definitely be getting different colors!"
I was surprised how attractive this hat is.  It is really pretty and extremely soft. It is warm and can be adjusted. I purchased the leopard one and love it.
This fleece hat is so soft and warm.  I use it when I walk my dog in the cooler weather early in the morning.  I can layer with a beanie underneath and my head and neck are so toasty!  I will enjoy wearing this with a ski helmet when I go skiing this winter too!
"4/5 because it is kind of thinner and looks like a cheaper material, but I mean... you can tell that from the pictures. It looks exactly like the pictures (which imo isn't really the cutest, but functionality > fashion in the winter)Bought it for a chilly camping trip (~35¬∞F) and was not disappointed. Design is perfect - blocked the wind, easily adjustable to be loose or tight, easy to drink/eat while wearing without having to stretch out the mouth cover. Soft, comfortable, cozy.I've now worn on 4 camping trips, machine washed and dried each time, and it still looks like the day I got it. Definitely recommend."
Soft snuggly and warm. Kept me warm during a trip to Iceland in November.
"I am snowboarder, I need a balaclava over the helmet, not inside the helmet, because I don‚Äôt like the balaclava too tight on my face and over my hair. This balaclava is exactly what I needed. My helmet is slightly bigger than normal adult, my helmet size is 65, if you are familiar the helmet size, normal adult would be 63. This balaclava fit over my helmet, and not very tight, I can still turn around my head to either direction easily, also the ropes in front can also help adjust the tightness of the balaclava. I really like it."
"Wasn't impressed at all with this purchase.  Seemed cheap, but boy, I was wrong!  It is amazing!!  Kept me warm when the windchill was 16.  I am ordering more to give as gifts!! Great purchase!"
"I bought this to wear while alpine skiing. It is a lot thinner and less plush than what the picture shows. It did fit well over my super warm hat, and kept my hat from flying off in the wind. I stayed warm, but again, had my awesome warm hat, so I‚Äôm not sure how it will be when I just have my ski helmet. I‚Äôll update when I find out."
I've had this for 2 years now and it's amazing. Keeps me super warm and it's extremely comfortable.
"I was not sure about ordering a female Balaclava as I thought i might look like a bank robber lol but I did and I and so pleased with it, it is thin material but so very warm and fits perfectly. It keeps my hair dry and the cold of my neck and ears definitely very functional  but stylish."
"I purchased this one and another one that was thinner for an Iceland trip. This one definitely did the work. It was perfect fit, comfortable and kept me warm during the entire time being out in the cold. The other one was too thin."
Very warm... versatile....I used it several was... Like it alot
Does what it's meant to doIf this was windproof it would be amazing.
"Love the product, keeps me very warm. I use mine for snowboarding and sometimes it gets a little too hot in there and I can‚Äôt breathe. Would be nice if had a nose port but you can always just lower the mask. Also it‚Äôs a hair short in length it seems, sometimes i‚Äôll get a breeze on my neck but overall i‚Äôd recommend."
"This is nice and soft, cozy, doesn‚Äôt smell weird - it‚Äôs perfect. I really like the double drawstrings. One controls the tightness around your forehead and the other controls around the top of your nose and back of your head. It‚Äôs fully customizable to fit your head/face shape, so you can‚Äôt go wrong with this if you have a small to medium sized head. Someone with a particularly large head may not be comfortable in this due to the depth of the hood, but I think it would work well for most people."
I bought this to work in the cooler & it sure kept my head & nose warm.
"So far, the quality seems very good. Nice, heavy weight fleece, with a few options on wearing it.  Fits my head perfectly..I wear 7 1/4 hats, and have close cropped hair. If you have a big head..or a lot of hair, I.can see this fitting you a little tight."
"I bought this product because of this claim‚ÄúFreezing moisture is the biggest cause of discomfort when skiing or out in the cold. That‚Äôs why the Tundra Balaclava has a breathable Poly-Spandex mouth panel and moisture wicking fleece to keep you both warm and dry all day‚ÄùI wore this product on a 6 mile walk today in 32¬∞F weather.  The ‚ÄòPoly-Spandex panel is just the same fleece the rest of the balaclava is made of.  There is nothing breathable about it.  By the end of my walk the entire mouth/nose panel was drenched.  I can only imagine how bad it will be when it‚Äôs -20¬∞F out.That said, the balaclava is soft and comfortable.The sales pitch is just overhyped."
"Good quality. Made of mostly fleece. Works well for most cold temps. I used it all the way down to -55c & it kept me warm enough! I like that it's longer, so it covers all of my neck & tucks into my sweater nicely to prevent skin exposure."
"2 cups arrived broken and buyer replaced them asap! Besides that, they are great!"
"I love the size of these glasses, they aren’t huge…so if you’re looking for a BIG glass for chugging water, this isn’t it. But if you want something reasonably-sized that doesn’t take up a ton of space in your cupboard, get these. They have a nice weight, wash up well in the dishwasher with no cloudiness, with a sleek and timeless design. I upgraded my glassware and am glad I went with this option. Perfect packaging was a plus."
"Thank you, these were great and affordable."
"These glasses are very nice; simple and comfortable to hold. Nothing fancy, they have a solid bottom, seem sturdy and hold up to a dishwasher well. Great for everyday use."
In love with these glasses! Fits in cabinets really well. It’s clear glass in color no turbidity. As far as appearance looks really good you can tell they’re quality glasses. I put these in my dishwasher and none has chipped or broken so the performance has held up pretty well
"I do not usually do product reviews, but felt compelled on this product. These glasses are extremely brittle. Day one I was getting ice out of the fridge ice machine. The ice falling into the glass was enough to break one. They broke in the top rack of the dishwasher. Our last pair of glasses survived 7 years and only broke if accidently dropped. Half of these broke within 2 months with just everyday use. We had to purchase another generic set from Walmart."
"I had been searching for drinking glasses that were pretty, strong, were a pleasure to drink from and narrow enough to fit in my dishwasher (between the tines.) I tried several brands, but was never satisfied. This set fit the bill!"
"I had a set from Target I bought in 2015, which were made by Libbey Glass as well. I recently broke two glasses and bought these to be replacements. They are exactly like the set I got from Target years ago. Excellent, sleek, chic glasses perfect for everyday use or for elegant barware. A+"
It’s wonderful to have matching glasses in our cupboards. I bought two sets of these.
"They look great in my place with the MidCentury decor, they fit right in. Thicker and higher-quality glass than I expected, at this price, to be honest."
These glasses are very thick and good quality. Very cute for a farmhouse or boho chic look. Glasses are true to size. Arrived perfectly.
"Beautiful glasses, sturdy, and exceptionally priced. Customer service was also great, quick to respond, and very accommodating. One glass arrived with a small chip in it and they were quick to offer multiple reasonable solutions that I was very pleased with."
"I wanted glasses that echo the hobnail glass that was popular in the 1950s-60s. These do that, plus they are much more substantial than I’d expected. I love how the texture makes them so easy to hold, too. Wish they were available in a teal or lt blue color!"
"I love the delicate hobnail design which also gives a nonslip feel in your hand along the slightly weighted feel. I also like the 2 sizes in this set, 10 & 12 oz.  I ordered the clear ones but the colors were very attractive, too."
LOVE these glasses so much. They are so chic and so sturdy.
WOW . That’s about the best word I can give !!! The glasses are gorgeous love the hobnail and weight.  They came in a great box with lots of padding.  The sizes are perfect for breakfast juice and dinner drinks.  They are a great value for the moneyTHEY ARE JUST THE BEST!!!!
"I love the look of these glasses! The glasses are made from thick, tempered glass that feels sturdy and durable. The classic design is simple yet elegant, making them suitable for a variety of occasions, from casual everyday use to more formal events. Also, very economical!"
Very thick and durable but not too heavy. They look great and are dishwasher safe. Came with great packaging and none broke upon arrival which is great. Perfect for a fancy drink or a plain soda. They hold cold very well. Can‚Äôt complain these are great.
The glasses are really lovely.  Feel substantial in your hand but not too heavy for my elderly relatives to use.  The shape is a nice change from traditional glasses and looks elegant.  One of the small glasses was broken during shipping (which was surprising because they were well-packaged) but the seller was very responsive and quickly made it right.  I have no complaints and wouldn't hesitate to buy these glasses again.
"This is a lovely set of cups, Perfect size for a Family, includes 4 large cups and 4 smalls cups, I would buy it again!"
These glasses are sleek and work well. One cup came broke but it was replaced right away. Very happy with them and customer service.
"The drinking glasses arrived as described, functional for different beverages, good sizes, good grips and easy to clean."
"This set was packaged incredibly well. It‚Äôs made of a light weight yet thick glass. This set is incredibly visually appealing and I‚Äôm very pleased with the purchase. I inspected each glass and all were flawless, free of any bubbles or chips. Will definitely order another set."
"They are well packaged and came in perfect condition. The glasses are bottom heavy so they don‚Äôt tip easy (just be careful how you put them in the dishwasher). The glasses are large and hold a lot of liquid. I like the shape and feel of them. They seem to be good quality and have a perfect thickness to make them last but aren‚Äôt too thick that they are cumbersome. I have had them 2 months now and all still good. My ONLY complaint is that I want to order more, but only the smaller glasses as we use these much more than the tall ones, but I can‚Äôt find them separately, so would have to order both which I don‚Äôt want. Otherwise, great buy for the price and would recommend."
I like the fact tgt i got short and long drinking glasses that are very nice and quality is very good
"Perfect Glasses!  A classic look and durable.  Plus,  great that comes in 4 count and I didn’t have to purchase 8 in an order. Recommended!!"
"Love these glasses. They are good quality and thick glass, wash well and came extremely well packaged. They are a little heavy but I quite like that as it doesn't feel like they'll break easily"
Perfect for making Old Fashions and everyday use.
Generally like these everyday glasses and have ordered these before. Unfortunately they were either not packed well or handled badly. One of the smaller glasses was broken to bits. The others survived but had been dislodged from the styrofoam.
Glasses have a good thickness to them.  Should hold up.
Bought this glass set because I wanted to get rid of all my plastic cups because I prefer drinking out of glass and these cups mentioned that  they were made of good quality so I figured I would give them a try. Over all great set. Glass is sturdy not that cheap flimsy glass something you get at the store. East to clean no staining or no chipping so far. Dropped a glass in the sink as I was putting it in and didn’t crack or shatter which I was happy about. I’ve had other glasses that I bought and just by tapping something else the wrong way they would break. But happy with the glasses and I would definitely recommend
Perfect. Exactly as expected
"Quality product , thickness is so perfect . We are looking for this kind of product . We are glad and happy to have one"
"Great quality, the glasses have a good weight to them"
i don't like the look of the glass finish
Wish the simple design I chose would have come with a thin drinking edge.
I just bought these and I throw out three already. These are easily broken. The mouth of them was chipped. Not sure what happened
"I discovered that my old glass set was not meant to be cleaned in the dishwasher - and the designs were peeling off.  These look good, the sizes work and I can pop them in the dishwasher instead of hand washing them."
These glasses are thick and quality glass. My kids tend to break glasses easily when they are doing dishes. They have not broken one of these glasses yet. The design is unique and they are a great addition to any kitchen.
"The glass itself is thicker, and I’ve had no problems with it. I had an earlier set. I think it was Libby or someone and it was so bad that I cut my hand a knuckle. It was so thin. It just broke so easy but these glasses are wonderful. Very good quality and a very reasonable price"
"I wasn't going to do a review because two of the glasses in this set were broken and I can't get a reaction from the goods store that they came from, but I decided to keep the ones I had just cause its a hassle to return things, I'm hoping they will send me some replacement glasses but we will see, the glasses are very nice however, nice set."
