The reason for the four-star is because they are good glasses but as you can see from the video there was one glass that had a crack in it. This is probably no-fault a manufacturing I‚Äôm guessing it was the Amazon delivery driver or during transport.  It isn‚Äôt worth my while to try and send them back and get a refund as it is only one glass but the quality seems to be there overall"
These are very sturdy and well made. They're the perfect size as well!
"The best bar accessories! This also came with a cocktail recipe book, which is a great resource for a quick guide on how to master your favorite drinks"
"This has almost everything your need in a small package. Nice dark wood stain, easy to us of you know what your looking for, ba perfect gift for anyone! Only wish it had sizes engraved on the jiggers for easy use on measurements ha ha. Great bang for your buck."
I did not use this product it looks great but it was bought for a gift
I gave this as a gift to my husband. He loved it. It's very Ratpackesque. The pieces are sturdy and heavy. The tray doesn't look cheap and it has almost everything a home bar needs. We are very pleased with it.
Great quality. Great price. This is comparable to the very expensive name brands.
"Works, looks nice, and does its purpose. Pretty close to money well spent."
Quality seems durable and the size is perfect for my office coffee/liquor bar! I’ve made a couple delicious cocktails so far with it and the performance of the shaker and strainer held up nicely! Doesn’t feel cheap at all. Everything went together well right out of the box! All holes lined up for all parts. Two thumbs up!
"I recently turned a sideboard into a bar, and wanted a compact bar kit. This kit has it all! Everything but the liquor. And the base that houses everything is surprisingly sturdy, compact, and visually appealing. I highly recommend this product!"
Love this for starting out a bar cart! Everything works really well. Convenient that everything can be stored together. Looks aesthetically pleasing. My husband loved receiving this as a gift and uses it often!
"This little kit has everything that you need for starters. I‚Äôm training to be a bartender so I got this to practice at home. I like everything except for the jiggers only because they‚Äôre different from the one I use at work. Quality is nice. The stand doesn‚Äôt hold the bar spoon very well but that‚Äôs all I have as far as opinion lol it‚Äôs a really nice set, can‚Äôt beat the price and quality!"
Have everything I need to make the perfect mix. The look is classic on my counter top but is still portable to other spaces. The recipe book is a added bonus. Great quality for cost.
Worked fabulous at my party
"The base/stand is pretty cheaply constructed, but looks nice enough on the shelf.  Others complained about the stability of some of the items staying put in the stand.  Hasn‚Äôt been an issue for me, but I don‚Äôt expect much from a set that mostly just sits on a shel out of the way.  Probably wouldn‚Äôt stay out in an earthquake though. LOLIf you‚Äôre looking for basic functionality, this works.  Would suggest spending a little more for the fancier, more quality versions if you‚Äôre hoping to show off both your bar and your mixology skills."
Upped my game as a bartender
"Decent quality, doesn‚Äôt tarnish and perfect for a at home barmaid kit"
jigger is not good and I couldn't find what's the capacity  on each side ; there also don't have detail on the website...
everything you need to make cocktails
Great kit for making cocktails
Works perfect for making drink garnishes. Easy to use and clean.
Cuts a nice garnish. Well made. Very happy.
Very fine product. Weighted handle makes it easy to use and the tip is very sturdy.
"Works great for really pithy lemons and oranges, nice long curls. Thin pith lemons and limes in general not so much"
"Really sharp, so be careful out of the box. Works well, will see how the wood handle holds up over time."
A fantastic accessory for any cocktail maker. Simple and elegant design. good value!
"I purchased the Viski Channel Knife, Cocktail Garnish Citrus Zester, and my experience with this bar tool has been quite disappointing. While it may have an appealing appearance with its walnut wood and stainless steel construction, the actual performance and quality are far from satisfactory.Despite its attractive appearance, the overall build quality is subpar. The tool feels flimsy and lacks the durability expected from a bar accessory. When it comes to its primary purpose, which is zesting or garnishing citrus for cocktails, the Viski Channel Knife falls short. The blade is not as sharp as it should be, making it a struggle to achieve clean and precise zests. This can result in messy and uneven garnishes.In conclusion, the Viski Channel Knife has been a letdown. While it may have an appealing design, it ultimately fails to deliver on the most important aspects of a bar tool: functionality and durability. I cannot recommend this product, especially considering its relatively high cost. There are better alternatives on the market that provide a more satisfying experience for cocktail enthusiasts."
Feels like a very real kitchen tool. Metal and wood build feels like it will last a long time. Tested on fruit numerous times now and have no problems with sharpness at all!
Bought one and thought it was a malfunction.  Nothing on the blade section to stop it from rotating. Ordered another and same thing.  Poor quality!
Great product and worth the price. The wooden handle seems untreated so I rubbed a bit of my cutting board mineral oil into the handle and now it looks even better!
"This is an excellent, must have tool in the kitchen.  I have had many zesters in the past - this one is the best I have ever used, very well made, and worth the price."
This is the perfect knife for making cocktail garnishes!
"Excellent solid glass does exactly what it's supposed to do. You can read the measurements on the side perfectly. You don't have to squint or get a maginifying glass to read the #'s on the side in black. We use this to measure our hot tub chemicals. And it works perfectly. I would definitely recommend it and I would purchase it again. It was an excellent design.  An perfectly priced! I may purchase another one! The weight is solid durable.If he dropped at once, it probably would not break.You can tell it's a well made product"
"This measure is awesome. It has markings for ml, oz, tsp, and tbs. Has a spout for pourability . Nice product."
I have multiple of these.  The writing on the side is super dark and easy to read.  Ass is a thicker quality so not easy to break.
This is perfect and just what I was looking for! Love that itâ€™s glass and has a bunch of different measurements
"This is a no-nonsense bar and kitchen tool: surprisingly thick glass, with a heavy bottom.  Put it down on a countertop, and you can pour stuff into it without worrying about tipping it.  Sharp, black markings are easy to read in normal light. If you have a dimly-lit bar area, the black markings might not be ideal, but the straight sides allow you to guesstimate fairly accurately, which is hard to do with those conical steel jiggers.  (If those things really are ""preferred by professionals,"" it's *because* they're hard to use!)"
"These are great measuring glasses!  This is our second set.  The only problem is that the measuring marks wear off after going in the dishwasher too many times.  We hand wash ours, but we would love the convenience of putting them in the dishwasher."
"Measuring small amounts of liquid, is a PITA with standard measuring cups.  This makes it ease to measure fractions of onces (up to 3+) or milliiters.  I use it all the time for mixing drinks."
Perfect for mixing maugaritas
I love that this shot glass is larger than most and can handle liquids easily for several drinks at one time.
"I purchased this to measure alcohol. I own shot glasses and had no idea what size they were. All these years I thought I was drinking 1oz drinks, but it turns out they are actually 2oz. Thanks to this measuring glass now I know. No wonder my liver enzymes were so high."
"After just one dishwasher wash all the printed measurements disappeared, so this glass is useless nowðŸ˜ž"
This product is exactly as it appears. The glass is thick so unlikely to break easily. The spout for pouring works well. No problems so far. Highly recommend.
"I purchased this stainless steel mixing glass after a crystal mixing glass I purchased (different brand) cracked merely from ice sitting in it after 2 1/2 weeks of use. I wanted something durable so I looked into this stainless steel mixing glass.I like it a lot and I'll give it 5 stars because it achieves the thing I was looking for. Durability. I don't have to worry about this thing cracking on me from temperature changes. With that said, there are a few things of note about this mixing glass.First is that it is not actually a circular opening. It is slightly ovular. It was hard for me to notice at first glance. I was initially disappointed because I thought my julip strainer didn't fit it, but then I noticed that the strainer would fit if used perpendicular to the pour spout instead of parallel like I was used to doing. So keep that in mind.Second, is it is much noisier than a crystal mixing glass. The back of the metal stirring spoon abrades against the inside of this stainless steel pitcher. Scratches develop very quickly on your spoon but that's nothing to worry about. However, the friction means that the stirring motion isn't the pleasant glide that you would get from a crystal mixing glass. But you're not buying this thing for aesthetic charm or texture, you're buying it for rugged durability.Third, because it is made of metal, the ice cubes want to stick to the bottom and sides of the glass before you start stirring especially if you are using a lot of smaller cubes with more points of direct contact against the metal. So it takes a little bit more force to get the ice moving.Once you get used to these things though, this is a perfectly functional, HIGHLY durable mixing glass. Overall, I think the crystal mixing glasses are far more enjoyable to use, but they come with a very high risk of cracking. At the end of the day, this stainless steel mixing glass gets the job done even if it isn't as pretty."
"I like to mix my old fashion drink in this glass.  It is very well made, and has a good looking design on the glass.  It is easy to clean, and works great if I am mixing one, two or three dinks.  The capacity, even with ice is very good.  I enjoy using it."
"I have purchased other Viski products and am generally pleased with them. This is a little retro in its elegant styling and has a nice weight to it. I have a Viski shaker in gunmetal color that I love. When I started exploring gin martinis, I wanted something I could stir a metal spoon inside without scratching it. This mixing glass with a 15"" Viski spoon makes a nice combination. It elevates the experience."
"This is a nice-looking mixing glass that is 23 ounces, not 18 ounces as originally advertised in the header's description.  This has been corrected subsequent to my purchase.  Otherwise, it is exactly as described.  A slightly smaller glass with a narrower diameter would be nice.  This glass can be difficult to hold while holding a strainer in place with the same hand."
"Heavy duty, feels quality."
"I’ve become an amateur mixologist the last couple years. Started following recipes exactly so to make sure I’m doing the drink justice. Fact is, you need to stir, not shake certain drinks to obtain the right flavors and texture. This does that and it looks good in my bar shelf."
"Feels great, smooth with no seams inside.The base is heavy to keep the glass still when mixing, Good size too.Very pleased"
The right sized beeker for mixing drinks and cocktails. Great pour point. Nice heavy base. Looks more expensive than it is. Perfect for stirred cocktail mixes.
"Stirred drinks, you can get by stirring them in the glass or in the shaker tin, but if you enjoy the bar stuff, there's nothing like this large clear vessel with its thick bottom, you don't have to hold it, it's heavy enough not to move and you can thoroughly stir your drinks. And it really is a major conversation piece 😁"
"No complaints. Decent pour on it, which is a complaint of a couple of other mixing jugs on here.Looks good and does the job."
"Here's everything you need to know about this mixing glass:- It's NOT 23 oz! It's more like 17 oz (approx. 550 ml), but trust me, you don't want anything bigger than that if you're just mixing one or two drinks at a time. 17 oz is the industry standard, so this is actually better (unless you're really looking for a 23 oz glass)- It's heavy enough. This mixing glass will not move around once the ice is in there (unless you're stirring like a caveman). Big win.- It's not a seamless glass, but the seam does not run all the way to the bottom of the glass, so you won't get an annoying clicking sound while stirring. No need to spend the extra money on a seamless one if you're just starting out- The glass isn't perfect, there are a few tiny bubbles, but you won't notice them from a distance. Other than that, the glass feels sturdy. Function over form!Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and I think you will be too"
"I had been looking for a good bartending kit for a while and I am not disappointed with this one.  Elegant, well presented with the stand, sturdy and practical."
Nice quality. Looks great on bar! I highly recommend.
"The weight and quality of each of the tools is great.  The stand looks nice and helps keep things organized on the bar top.  Not sure if/when I'll use the pourers, but I like the option to have them.Would like to have some more classic cocktails in the recipe bookLooking forward to putting this to use."
Ordered many sets and chose this one.  It has everything you need to make great cocktails!!  Love the shaker - feel like a bartender!!
Great quality product we love it
This is all you need
"Good quality, has everything and more for the home bartender, all in an aesthetically pleasing counter piece."
"Without overkill offering countless never to be used pieces, this product seems just right for my needs."
"I looked at a lot of different barware kits before buying this one.  The price is on par with all the others, so that was not a big factor.Not all kits have a peeler for garnishes.  This one does, and it works really well.The caddy stores everything  well, and makes it easy to transport in and out of your cupboard if you don't have a space to keep it out all the time (e.g. if your ""bar"" is also your kitchen).The only thing missing is a channel knife for making lemon twists.  And to make it absolutely perfect, it could use a 0.25 oz marking on the jigger.  (Note:  Etens does make another jigger which does have a 0.25 oz marking, so I bought one of them -- having two jiggers isn't a bad idea anyway).I paired the kit with a mixing glass from A Bar Above.  That, plus the channel knife, and my bar is fully equipped and makes great drinks."
Purchased for use during holidays. And into 2025 and beyond. My 20 something family members are seriously into cocktails and recipes. I finally have a bar set. To go on my counter. Or outside in spring / summer.  Woukd also make a perfect gift. Three year No Rust warranty.  Looks very good in stand. Iâ€™ll toast to that. Cheers!
"I really liked this 16 piece bartending kit from barebarrel . Excellent product, easy to use and great quality!"
"I really like this cocktail mixing set. I've often thought of myself as a mixologist ðŸ¤—, now I truly feel like one! This is a 16 piece, stainless steel set, some items like the wine corks have black accents. Its a high quality set, durable everything from the shaker to the stirers etc. are good quality. Its an ideal size for a countertop, mini bar etc. it comes with a caddy, but I don't personally like it. It is made from wood, sturdy keeps everything in its place. What I don't like is that for me it cheapens the look of the set. I wish it came with a black caddy or at least the option to choose. Its not a deal breaker but a preference. Good value and  comes with a cocktail booklet so you too can easily become an at home bartender.Also comes with a rust proof guarantee and customer service website right on the box!"
I absolutely love this set! It comes with every thing you need for your home bar! I highly recommend this set.
Looks very nice in my home bar
"This is an excellent, premium and professional -looking and -feeling set of drink-making tools that's very well-made and excellent to hold and use. Every piece fits together perfectly and fit well into the places in the bamboo rack that are designed to hold them. The cocktail recipe cards are also very well-made from thick paper and given on a twine string that fits well into a space in the base. I like how it looks and feels, it fits in perfectly at a private bar and it looks great in almost any setting. This includes everything you could realistically want if you're looking to get into cocktail mixing and creation, or for practicing your skills!The zester is the one exception to the professional look. If you look up close at the part where the zester connects to its handle, you can see how it's connected together, which is something that isn't an issue on any of the other pieces. Since it doesn't affect how well it works and it still looks nice overall I'm not counting that as a significant negative. The small little cleaner brush is also quite small, as well, but it doesn't need to be larger to work well. I'm not a fan of the basic little rubber covers that go over the liquor pourers, but they do the job.Almost everything in this kit is made of pure stainless steel - in fact, the only parts I can find that aren't steel are the silicone parts on the stoppers, the rubber stopper covers, and the bamboo rack. I don't know what grade of steel they're made from, but they're holding up well to use for various drinks and they've been put through the dishwasher a few times now with no visible changes. I'm confident they're durable enough to last a long time, as long as they're taken care of properly - don't leave them wet for long periods of time when not in use.Everything works exactly as you'd want them to work. The cobbler shaker fits together easily and doesn't leak, the liquor pourers both work perfectly to pour out liquor or flavored syrups quickly with no dripping, the mesh strainer has fine mesh and can hold a sizeable amount of solids, the Hawthorne strainer is great for quick straining while you're pouring out drinks, and the bottle stoppers work well for several sizes of bottles - anything that could use a standard cork.Overall, this is an excellent set of barkeeper tools that I'm going to keep using for long while. I'll update this review if any issues with any of them pop up down the line.I only review things that I personally use myself on a regular and continued basis. I always give my full, honest, unbiased and unfiltered opinion on everything I review. I will not hold back or avoid describing any issues I have with a product. I write exactly what I think about things - the good, the bad, the ugly, and the questionable. And, I will update my review if something breaks, stops working as intended, or otherwise doesn't hold up as expected."
