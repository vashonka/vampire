"I‚Äôve only been wearing these for two weeks, but these shoes are great. Very comfortable, light, good grip, and great support. The size is true, they fit perfectly. These are one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I‚Äôve ever had."
"I am very impressed with the quality of these new Fila‚Äôs that I just purchased. They are much better quality than my previous ones! I was recently having bad lower back pain that I thought was from something that I did while working, but it turns out since I put these new shoes on my lower back pain is just about gone!! Plus the anti-slip and being waterproof is a high plus!! I highly recommend these shoes and I am going to purchase an extra pair so I can rotate them."
"This review is about my own personal comfort while wearing the shoe. I got these in yesterday. The slip resistant outer sole is there and everything else is OK.  But I am hard to please - I have a wide right foot and an super wide, flat, left foot, so this is about trying to find the widest, most supportive. This is difficult, given that almost no shoes exist that are super wide, truly water slip resistant, black work shoes. Recently I've bought a couple of different shoes and five different insoles, in addition to my existing shoes.  This Fila shoe (I ordered wide) is ok for comfort for my right foot. But not quite wide enough for the left( The shoe is 4E) I ordered a size larger as usual. The toe area is kind of snug. I think I'll go ahead and wear the shoes on alternating days - I replaced the insoles with Dr. Scholls insoles. The other brand I bought lately were New Balance 626. The XX wide in that shoe is actually a 6E. The NB is wide enough for my left foot - and I would say the comfort in that shoe is okay, but not spectacular. In the past, I've ordered Reebok Work N Cushion 4.0 in 4E - that shoe has been the most comfortable. Even though it's only a 4E - there is plenty of room and comfort. Reebok is the only shoe that for me is true size. I can order a 10 1/2, which is my size, but all other brands I need to order an 11. Unfortunately, Reebok for whatever reason does not keep it in stock anymore - the last one's I got were in February 2022 - there is no more.  It seems that, given the reviews I've read, a lot of men are also searching for really wide shoes - but forgive them - they'd also like a comfortable shoe - that kind of shoe is hard to find.  Really boggles the mind that manufacturers are not meeting those requests.  I have also tried the NB fresh foam recently - in 4E - they were wide enough, and comfortable enough, but the problem was that they had too MUCH foam. Instead of calling them New Balance, it felt like I was Off Balance.  I don't need a shoe where I'm floating around, feeling like I'm about to lose my balance.I've tried several Dr. Scholls insoles, because all the shoes I buy need the insoles replaced right out of the box with a gel insole to make them tolerable for myself."
Comfortable fit with memory foam. Made of Leather.
"Ah, the allure of budget work shoes. They promised comfort, durability, and memory foam so advanced, I‚Äôd practically be walking on clouds. Instead, I got the footwear equivalent of a medieval torture device.First, the craftsmanship: exquisite! If by ‚Äúexquisite‚Äù you mean the soles were thin enough to let me count gravel stones by texture. And let‚Äôs not overlook the toe box ‚Äî where apparently staples and stitching conspire to create the world‚Äôs worst foot massage.Memory foam? More like selective amnesia foam. It forgot to do its job five minutes into the shift. By hour 12, my feet looked like they‚Äôd auditioned for a horror movie. I think I discovered muscles in my feet I didn‚Äôt even know existed, screaming in ways I didn‚Äôt know they could.Final verdict: If you‚Äôre looking for shoes to protect your feet while walking over a bed of Legos, avoid these at all costs. But if you‚Äôre into living dangerously, or need a creative way to get out of work for a week, these are your golden ticket."
"This is my first pair of FILA shoes, and I was wondering about their quality. All my doubts were away when I began to use them. They are extremely comfy with very good quality. Totally recommendable."
"I purchased these after comparing them to several other identical brands that were more expensive.  These are very well made, very comfortable - right from the start - no issues with blisters are sore feet.  I will say if you are between sizes you may want to size up as they are very very true to size.  There is no extra room for anything in between."
"I absolutely love these ODOLY Women's Cork Footbed Slide Sandals! They remind me so much of the brand-name version, but at a fraction of the cost. I‚Äôm usually a size 7.5, and these fit perfectly in that size. The cork footbed is super comfortable, and the adjustable buckle makes it easy to get the perfect fit. I‚Äôve been wearing them all summer, and they‚Äôve held up great, whether I‚Äôm at the beach or just running errands.My husband even commented on how nice they look, and he‚Äôs pretty picky about these things! It‚Äôs rare to find something that‚Äôs both stylish and budget-friendly, but these sandals definitely hit the mark. I got them in brown, and they‚Äôve become my go-to pair this summer.If you‚Äôre looking for comfy, stylish sandals without breaking the bank, I‚Äôd totally recommend giving these a try. I definitely want them in even more colors!"
"These fit like a glove, and I love the color! Normally, I‚Äôm not a fan of this style since it can look a bit rough for women‚Äôs shoes, but these are soft and feel more delicate. I have narrow feet, so keep that in mind, but the buckle can be adjusted for a wider fit. Note, though, that if I make them tighter, my foot doesn‚Äôt go all the way in, which shortens the shoe length. If you're unsure about sizing, consider the width of your foot and whether you‚Äôll need to tighten or loosen them, as that will affect the length. I‚Äôm a size 6 in most shoes, and my heel comes right to the edge, which I like. The base conforms to your foot, and I was worried they‚Äôd slide off, but the slightly raised back offers good heel support. Perfect for running errands and wearing around the house. Great price too‚Äîdefinitely keeping them!"
"These for true to size, and. Were pretty comfortable. Wore everyday for most of summer. The one thing that I didn‚Äôt like was the inside of the strap where the buckle was snapped onto, the inside metal covering of that snap or whatever you would call it was fairly cheap and became bent and loose . I was able to bend it back flat  with some pliers . But overall great quality for the price"
"These sandals were AMAZING!!! So stylish, cute, and comfortable! I am writing this review because I wore the sandals with and without socks for a few days on the Vegas Strip. Tens of thousands of steps later and many miles walked I had no foot pain whatsoever! If you‚Äôve ever been there, you know it is hard to spend a few days exploring without any blisters or foot pain! I‚Äôll admit that I wasn‚Äôt sure if they would be able to handle all the walking, but for $20 and an almost identical look to a well-known name brand sandal, these deserve an A+++ rating! Highly recommend, and I hope they last a while!PS: sizing didn‚Äôt seem to be a huge issue, but this may be worth noting. I bought an 8-8.5 at first and then a 9 because I was curious what the difference would be. When I tried them each on, the fit was just about identical. It was so hard to tell the difference, and it was even hard to make a choice on which pair to keep after adjusting both buckles. The difference was so hard to tell, if there even was a difference. (Both pairs said 40 on the bottom.) I am normally an 8.5 in shoe sizes and ended up keeping the 8-8.5. They fit just fine and I had no issues with the shoes being too small."
The footbed is so comfortable and supportive.  I can stand for long periods and walking is amazingly comfortable.  The fit is good.  I have not had a problem with blistering while wearing these shoes.  Great bargain for the price.
These seems to be durable.  The size and fit are phenomenal. My daughter hasn't gotten. Any blisters yet and they are very easy to walk in. She loves her stylist knock off birks!

I was going to vacation and wanted some cute sandals that could be comfortable and could match with anything I wore. These were absolutely perfect and fit the description. Only reason I docked 2 star was because of the straps and the quality. I am a size 7 - which the shoes themselves fit perfectly but the straps were a bit loose. It wouldn‚Äôt stop flopping off my feet until I put the straps into the last hole and second to last hole. Then it was perfect. But then after just 2 days of wearing them, they were already stretched. So now I‚Äôm practically holding on with every step because I ran out of holes lol. After the second day I also realized the shoe does leave a bit of an orangey color residue on your feet. After the fourth day, some of the parts of the shoes were already wearing out when I did not wear them for much nor did excess activity with them. Such as the heels and inner sides somehow. Overall I got these for a deal and you do get what you pay for. They are really cute, comfortable, and wearable for a short time, but I do wish they would have at least lasted me longer than 4 days before starting to go downhillüò≠"
I like the color cous it simple
"These sandles are fab. Slight bounce for comfort, cool comfortable fashionable. Great value for money would certainly reccomend."
Love my new sandals. So soft & comfortable to wear. You certainly don‚Äôt have to worry about wearing them in or getting blisters. Gree re at quality & price. Very happy.
They are comfortable and light.  Great slip ons
"I have purchased, worn and re soled many pairs of Birks over the years, these Cusionaire's are a find! They look great, feel great and I have purchased 2 more pairs in colors I would not buy Birks in because they cost so much. These are SO reasonably priced! I bought the first pair this summer and they are holding up great, true to size, sole not disintegrating etc...I hope they will have a long life but even if they last a good year, I will be happy."
"I absolutely love my CUSHIONAIRE Women's Luna Cork Footbed Sandals! These sandals have quickly become my go-to for both casual and dressed-up looks, and they are incredibly comfortable. The cork footbed offers amazing arch support, which makes a big difference when I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m on my feet all day. The footbed molds perfectly to the shape of my foot, giving a custom fit and unparalleled comfort.The +Comfort feature really lives up to its name‚Äö√Ñ√Æthe sandals are soft but still supportive, and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t feel any discomfort even after hours of wear. I was worried about whether they would hold up with frequent use, but the build quality is excellent, and they feel sturdy and durable.Style-wise, these sandals are super cute and versatile. They pair well with everything from jeans to dresses, and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve received so many compliments on them! The adjustable straps also make it easy to get the perfect fit.Overall, these sandals are the perfect combination of comfort, style, and support. Whether you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re walking around all day or just looking for something stylish for everyday wear, the CUSHIONAIRE Luna Cork Footbed Sandals are a fantastic choice. Five stars all the way!"
"As someone who owns multiple pairs of Birks, these sandals are absolutely up to expectations of real Birks! The Birks I have are the Arizona soft footbed. I wanted this style of Birks but I couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t find the soft footbed version in them. I saw these are thought I may as well try them for the price. Let me tell you these are even more comfy than my soft footbed Arizona Birks! Omg they feel amazing. They are nice and padded! They are so adorable too! Great quality. Will they last as long as real Birks? Possibly not as long, but for the price, they are absolutely worth it. They may very well last as long as real Birks. I have only had them a few weeks. They could easily charge a lot more for the quality of these. The price is a steal. They don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t rub anywhere. As far as sizing goes I agree they run a little small. I went with what the reviews said and got a size 8. I am typically a size 7.5 (sometimes 7) in sandals. I sometimes wear an 8 in sandals if they run small like these. In nike sneakers I am a size 8. They LOOK almost identical to real Birks. I wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be able to tell these weren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t the real deal if I saw someone wearing them to be honest. You would have to look close to see the Birkenstock name is missing. I highly recommend these to anyone with back/leg/foot pain as well. They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re just all around cute, stylish, super comfy and durable shoes! If this review helps let me know by clicking the helpful button. Thanks! :)UPDATE: They are holding up fantastic! I wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t sure about the longevity of these, but they have proven to be quality shoes! I now ordered another color in these sandals and also another style from this brand! I highly recommend!"
"To me, these fit better and are more comfortable than Birkenstocks.  However, the toe strap broke after 5 months.  To be fair,  I wore them EVERY day, but still that's a short life span.  So, I broke down and bought a pair of Birks yesterday & wore them inside the house.  The toe area rubs, so they are going back - these are simply more comfortable for me.  I can buy 2 pair a year at this price.  Hopefully, this company will make an even better, durable product based on all the comments."
I bought these summer of 2023 and it is now Nov of 2024.  I bought them because I needed something other than flip flops to wear since it's warm here most of the year. I like that they look like Birkenstocks without their price tag! You do need to break them in first before they are commfy but after that they are great.  I have worn these almost everyday since I got them and the have held up very well.  I will probably buy another pair next summer as I am sure I will need to replace them by then.  But for real buy these actually buy a few pairs of them! They are true to size and if you have flintstone feet like me they are perfect!
"This is the second time I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve purchased these sandals and I highly recommend them.They are comfortable, super cute and very affordable. I ordered the cognac and love the color. I also have found that their sizing is true to size. If you like the style of Birkenstocks but don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to spend $100 + give these sandals a try, I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think you‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll be disappointed."
"I liked my first so well I bought a 2nd pair. I live in hawaii where it's humid so I appreciate the comfortable foot bed that does not make your feet sweat. They have great arch support. I've had plantar fasciitis for years and I do recommend these for people who have this issue. My 2nd pair was a little snug but wearing them bit they became as comfortable as my 1st pair. They have not gotten to loose, if ya know what I mean. Some how they stay a comfortable size by not stretching out like leather. I got one of the black colors and the whisky which is a great color. I would like to get another color as well. I do not remember a smell and ease of use is slide in walk away lol!!! I think they are great and very affordable"
"Even my daughter who has like 20 pairs of birks thought these felt good and were good for the price. She was impressed with how soft the footbed is. Its getting cold so haven't worn enough to say how they will hold up, but seem well made. I do like her soft footbed birks with oil rubbed leather better, but they are $100 more."
"I really like these sandals! Comfortable, great support and true to size. Super quality and value for the price!"
Love the quality of these slides. They are truly to size and I can dress them up or down.
"This sandals quality is great, true to size and the great price, good material also this color goes with many outfits it's very cutesy"
I rate this sandal 5/5 since it looks just like the photo. It's true to size and quite comfortable. I will surely purchase sgain.

Fits good , looks good Can‚Äôt wait until my bday to wear it"
Super cute sandals I like the style but not the most comfy when wearing them for long hours.
Comfortable light weight shoes and stylish
"True to size , also looks good"
Very cute but not comfortable to wear. Left marks on my feet. Maybe a half size up might work. But not for me.
"Shoes are beautiful, the support in them aren‚Äôt the best mostly for looks. But they are pretty."
"I kept them in the end, but they are very cheaply made- would not recommend"
Love this design. Premium design. Love the colour.
"I wear flip-flops around the house all the time. I've had several pair of crocs, and they're really good. These are similar to the more expensive Oofos, in that they're very comfortable and cushiony for your feet. The problem I had with Oofos is that they had smooth soles, no traction on the inside, and when they got wet (I tried wearing them in the shower) my feet slipped and I nearly fell. I had to take them off. These have some traction on the inside, and I've worn them in the shower with no problems. The fit was true to size and they are comfortable and supportive. I would buy them again."
"They were a little tight at first but didnt take long to loosen up a bit and now they fits my fat feet great. They are comfortable, great material. Sturdy. Wont be breaking any time soon.."
"I had a pair of the original recovery sandals, also in a flipflop style. After two years of wearing them a few hours a few days per week in the summer months only-the sole was terribly worn and they caused dangerous slipping on tile or smooth floors. 75% cheaper and a sturdier sole than the ‚Äúoother‚Äù recovery sandal. Very similar style and design. I bought the black color which is just a basic black rubber. They were immediately more comfortable and seem to be of better materials and more solid construction. Another nice feature is that the flip flops from years ago would leave a black stain on your feet from a black footbed. These do not. I eliminated one star because these are slightly narrow and a bit tight across the arch, but I imagine they will likely stretch as time goes by. Good deal!"
"Not the best looking but they'll do! That said, they are the closest in comfort to a pair of old Nike Kelso flip flops I had for 8 years. They no longer make those flip flops like they used to forcing me to look elsewhere. These are easy to slip on and off, have a nice thick squishy cushion feel, nice not overly raised arch support, and each of my toes sink in without any odd pressure. I wear slippers in the house at all times and stand often. I try to find slippers that copy fatigue mats. Thanks to AMZN for dealing with my purchasing and returning about 10 pairs. I kept both the Shevalue slide ons and these thong flip flops. Can't speak so much for durability as these are my indoor only slippers but they definitely can be cleaned easily."
"Since buying these, I've not worn any other shoes. Simply because they are comfortable. It feels like walking in air. The only draw back is that I now have sandals lines on my foot, but that's just cause they are fat lol. But it's a nice snug fit and the black color goes with anything at all I am wearing. If you suffer from plantar fasciitis, these may be great for you. The thickness gives great arch support. It was a quality buy for me."
"Super comfortable and soft, although it's a different material than Oofos, it's also a lot cheaper and about 75% as comfy.These definitely work well if you are recovering from or have foot pain, especially pain in the connective tissue on the sides of your feet. Feet and your foot doctor told you to get a super soft recovery slide.However, my son has sweaty feet so the black coloring of these comes off and gets on his feet which is embarrassing. It just looks like his feet are filthy underneath where the shoe touches him.I don't have sweaty feet so I don't have that problem. I imagine if you get them wet the same problem might happen. But you should never get such slippery material wet, especially when it's on your feet, I would be much more concerned about a slip hazard as flip-flops are a major contributor to fall related injuries and water is another.There is not much arch support, maybe if you were flat-footed this would have arch support for you. But the primary advantage of these is how soft your step is in cases where you need to recover from injury and you need your step to be soft.I would wear these to Disneyland and have. Stand all day. All day, these are the second best recovery slides you can wear."
"I was skeptical about these, but I‚Äôm so glad I bought them! I had to get used to the part that goes between your toes, as it was a little big. After a couple weeks wearing them on and off, I could wear them 24/7 without any pain and they felt so great! It was a huge relief when walking on concrete. My plantar fasciitis markedly improved and soon I didn‚Äôt want to wear anything else. I only wish I could wear them in the snow. Haha!"
"This are still my favorite. I bought a PR for summer. Loved them so much I bought a new pair to take on vacation to Antigua. Well as days went on. I thought my feet were swelling..  Nope  they shrunk. Last 2 days of vacation I could not wear as my heal was hanging off the back. I still recommend these but do not take where it's extremely warm. Like the Caribbean. I will purchase more next summer. Fit perfectly, great quality and was comfortable walking. Thinking of a different color other than blk."
"This are perfect sandals for those with problems with arch support, planters fasciitis and flat feet. They heel is very comfortable, easy to clean. I normally can not walk in flip flops however I could walk short distances without pain or the strap digging between my toes of leaving my with burn marks and friction marks.A little heavy for travelling however at home, beach, the pool, the gym in the garden, short walks to the market, grocery they are perfectI will never wear flat flip flops again. I used them from the day purchased in the spring of 2024 and they also kept their shape, colour and comfort"
"All I can say is that they are super comfortable and fit well.  My feet are fairly flat and not too wide.  Some people note they are big or wide.  They stay on my feet very well.  The arch supports are very nice, not too high, great cushion.  I wear them to the pool and shower in them daily, they dry well and don't absorb water. The pink is super cute!"
This pair of footwear sizing fit me well but the concern I had is the new footwear base show many cracked lines? It is new footwear but many cracked lines. So had to return. The arch support is not visible n flatten easy because it is rubber material. Overall a good experience in getting correct sizing. Just that material draw concern. Thank you
"I‚Äôve been using the Shevalues Orthotic Flip Flops for a while now, and I am thoroughly impressed with the comfort and support they provide. The arch support is excellent, and they have made a noticeable difference in reducing foot fatigue during long walks. The material is durable, and they feel lightweight, making them perfect for everyday use. These flip flops are also stylish, easy to clean, and maintain their shape well. Overall, they‚Äôve exceeded my expectations, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for comfortable yet supportive footwear!"
"It was a great purchase, it fits like a glove, excellent quality and very comfortable. Be careful when it rains, it can be a bit slippery."
Very comfortable flip flops with womanizing soft look
There a little tight and stiff at first but after wearing them they fit good. There good for cheap sandals
I absolutely love these shoes and I have been looking for a brand that carried them in my size and I finally found them. I am forever grateful for that. They fit perfectly fine. They‚Äôre very durable overall 10 out of 10. I love the black the color and the is to get on there‚Äôs no problems with these shoes. Fantastic work.
Great material and quality! The color is the perfect shade of brown. They are slip-resistant and very comfortable! They are my favorite go-to sandals to slip on!
"Too flat perhaps.. just don't feel right when walking.  Cute design though but uncomfortable,  can't wear it for long while."
It‚Äôs an exact fit. My feet length is 12‚ÄùI think Amazon changed the sizing because I bought a 131/2 and it fits good and now I buy the same size in this it‚Äôs a bit too small
"These are really cute and great quality for the price! They run a full size small, size up!"
These are super cute and Dainty
These flip-flops are super cute and very comfortable
"This sandle is more like a shoe !  The arch support and sole are perfect . Very comfortable for this flatfooted guy. I've been able to walk 6 miles a day in these . This size is true , not too small , not too large . As these are worn daily , I also wash them often to keep them clean and from smelling they are easy to wash in the bathroom sink or shower. The soles seem durable and comfortable. The soles are like a running shoe . Pricing is excellent for the value . !"
"I recently purchased a pair of men's sport flip flops, and they have quickly become my go-to footwear for the summer. These flip flops are incredibly comfortable, with a cushioned footbed that provides excellent support for all-day wear. The straps are soft and don't cause any chafing, even after long periods of use.The flip flops have a durable sole that offers great traction, making them perfect for a variety of activities, from beach trips to casual walks. I also appreciate the stylish design that pairs well with both casual and sporty outfits. They are easy to clean and have held up well against wear and tear, showing no signs of deterioration.Overall, these men's sport flip flops are a fantastic purchase. They combine comfort, durability, and style at a reasonable price. Highly recommended for anyone in need of a reliable pair of flip flops."
Nice product fit and cushion as you walk. The only issue I had was the grip design inside the shoe was a little ruff when I first started wearing them. I‚Äôm past all that now and happy I purchased them.
Well made and comfortable. Size is right on.
"These sandals are wonderful, provide good foot support, and are very comfortable to wear!"
They are very comfortable and look very nice. However if your going to use these everyday I would look elsewhere.
"I was looking to replace my older pair of leather flip-flops but needed better arch support. I am always skeptical when arch support is advertised, especially for a flip-flop. However, this has been one of the best flops I have worn in a long time. The sizing was spot on. I would recommend getting."
Very comfortable. Great value for the quality.
"These sandals are very stylish and seem to be very good quality however, the size 14 was still not roomy enough for my husband to slip his foot into easily.  The top of his foot would get stuck so we sent them back. If you have narrower feet that probably wouldn't happen."
"Well made, very nice !"
