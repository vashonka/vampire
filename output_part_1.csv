"Can't beat the price and can't beat the quality of a Dell. I bought this for my dad because he needed for non-complicated things, and its the best to get for seniors I believe. Fast, reliable, won't break down, highly recommend!!"
"I love it. Great size, easy to operate, value can't be beat."
Battery level Fe isn't great
"The screen became detached and broken the 13th month after purchasing it, which of course was 1 month after the 1-year warranty expired.  It cost me $164 for a local computer repair shop to get it working again.  The technician explained that Dell is now holding the screen in place to its frame with ""2-sided tape rather than with metal screws"" as once was standard.  What a cheap way for reputable Dell to make its laptops!  To would-be buyers, I recommend purchasing a two year warranty, which simply shouldn't be necessary on this otherwise fast, handy touchscreen laptop.  Also, open the screen from the middle, not from either end of the screen so as not to put pressure on the frame and detach it from that worthless 2-sided tape!The second one I ordered lasted a few days before the screen went black!  The seller took over a week to refund my payment."
Laptop is perfect.
Came well wrapped and packaged.. battery life is great. Was hesitant but glad I made d purchase
"Heavy, and I don’t like the keyboard. Number pad should not be a part of the keyboard.  Price dropped by 20% right after I bought it."
"It is a different format but once you get accustom to the computer it works well. It is faster, color clearer."
"I love this computer. The delivery was very fast and the packaging was great. It took just a few minutes to set everything up. This is the computer that I used every single day for my work from home, and for some occasional streaming of shows and movies. I love it. The display is also just the right size for my home office."
"Great product, ideal for home and great power."
"I am not a computer geek. So I had to Google instructions on how to turn it on and off.  I'm a senior citizen and my last computer (10 years old) had complete diagrams. Once I figured it out, it is fine"
"So far the computer is working fine.  However, out of the box there was no keyboard dongle so I connect the wireless keyboard.  The only option is to return the whole computer which is unacceptable.  All I need is the dongle."
"Works fast,screen bigger"
It comes up very quickly.
"I love my new Dell computer. After I got it set up it is working great, love the screen size. I’m an older person and not tech savvy but I did ok with it. They could give you better information on setting it up."
"I was on a waiting list for a 'Renewed Premium'. Seemed to be a long waiting list. I finally gave up and went with a 'Renewed' advertised in excellent condition. Given Amazon's generous return policy, returning it would have been easy if there had been issues. I probably wouldn't have tried this with an online retailer other than Amazon and Apple.The supplier was TECHMINT, Amazon was only the purchase portal. There seems to be a number of 'Amazon-qualified suppliers' involved. To know who you're buying from, the 'ships from/sold by' info. is on the right side of the product page. There may also be differences in packaging and accessories. Best to read through the advertising to know exactly what you're buying. Or contact the supplier before purchasing. Given that Amazon backs these purchases, not a concern.It arrived without scratches, dings, or apparent wear. Looks like new. That said, those buying a 'Renewed' phone should expect varying degrees of condition within the parameters of Amazon's advertising. I'd suggest buying a 'Renewed Premium' for your best chance of a like-new phone. I probably got lucky with a 'Renewed'.It shipped in *very* well designed and protective box designed for phones. Not likely to be damaged in transit short of extremely heavy crush damage. If you plan on shipping your phone or storing a back-up, I'd suggest keeping it. The box has spacers to accommodate different sizes. Kudos to the packaging engineers. Well done.It was delivered with 100% battery health which almost certainly means that the phone was opened up and the battery replaced. The likelihood of a 'renewed' 13 Mini arriving with battery health at 100% is slim to none. I assume that they did this because the phone was traded in with ≤ 80% battery health. The advertising states that the phone will arrive with battery health of ≥ 80%.I ran two diagnostics to check functions. In both cases, no issues. One of the diagnostics is built into iOS. You'll need iOS 17 or later and not a beta release. Search for 'built in iPhone diagnostic' for instructions. There's another which makes doing this quite a bit easier. From the Apple app store search for 'Phone Doctor Plus'. It leans more towards being a function check vs a more sophisticated diagnostic but great for making sure everything works. There's a free and paid version. There are others but these are the only two I've tried.The advertising stated that an MFi certified charging/data cable ships with the phone. Mine shipped with a 3ft cloth jacketed USB C to Lightning charging cable. No branding or print on the cable, no included documentation, no packaging. It appears similar to what you sometimes see without packaging and hanging from peg racks in convenience stores.I have no reason to believe that the provided cable isn't MFi certified and from a reliable manufacturer but without more information, I'd suggest using an Apple product or something from a reliable aftermarket supplier such as Anker or Belkin. Look for 'MFi certified' especially if you want fast charging capability. There are reasons USB C cables can be pricey, especially those designed for high power delivery. Better safe than sorry.Mine shipped without a charger. I checked the interior packaging to be sure. I'd say the same about a charger as I did about the cable - MFi certified and from a reputable manufacturer - Apple, Anker, Belkin, etc. For the 13 Mini, Apple recommends a minimum of a 20 watt charger for optimal/fast charging . Apple's is about 20 dollars. It's also what Apple recommends for powering *the original* MagSafe accessory. The updated version of the MagSafe charger supports faster charging and according to Apple, a minimum of a 30 watt charger for optimal performance.Some suppliers advertise that a sim card removal tool is included. Mine didn't. If yours shipped with a sim card (mine did not), I'd suggest reading through the pros and cons of SIM vs eSIM. If eSIM meets your needs, I'd recommend removing the SIM and switching to eSIM. Switching to eSIM can be done in your phone's settings. No expertise or hardware required. Although unlikely if buying from an 'Amazon-qualified supplier' (I assume), SIM cards can be compromised. If you need a SIM card, best to get one from your carrier instead of a mystery SIM.You'll need a case. Without, it's not a matter of if you'll drop it but when. This is my second mini, the first an iPhone 12 Mini. Slippery and with a smaller form factor than other iPhones, very easy lose grip especially if you have large hands. Further, without a case the camera lenses and screen make contact with whatever surface you place them on.The Apple leather case has been my go-to for the last 3-4 iPhones. Very well designed, doesn't add significant bulk, no sharp edges and it slips into and out of a pocket easily. The drop protection has proven to be excellent. Great case for all but extreme circumstances. They're relatively pricey so If you're looking to save, there are often Amazon customer returns available at steeply discounted prices.The iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini cases are not interchangeable. I tried. The camera lens housings are different. The 12 mini case will not fit the 13 mini. The 13 mini case will fit the 12 mini but there will be a gap on the right side of the lens housing.Not to overstate it but If you're considering both the 12 mini and 13 mini, battery life may be problematic for heavy users. True of all phones but more so for a Mini. If you have a full size phone with a larger battery at ≥ 90% battery health (guesstimate) and often find yourself scrambling to find a charger, the Mini may not be for you.If you're on the move a lot without convenient charging options, a small MagSafe power bank (≤ 5000mAh) will bring some peace of mind and a lot of convenience. Great when traveling. Definitely stick with time tested manufacturers. Anker and Belkin sell a wide variety. Note that the TSA only allows powerbanks in carry-ons.Apple discontinued it's iPhone powerbanks (Magsafe Battery Pack). As of this writing, you can still find them new from third party sources such as Walmart online. Never buy used. There are confirmed and very convincing counterfeits out there so I'd be cautious about which supplier you choose.If you're looking at both the 12 and 13 Minis, the 13 Mini uses an A15 processor which is somewhat more energy efficient and slightly faster. It also has a ~10% larger battery. There are quite a few other differences including an upgraded camera.In day to day use, I found the differences to be almost unnoticeable. Having a larger battery is nice but rarely something that makes a difference given my usage habits. Those that push their phones harder will probably appreciate the extra power.Definitely worth reading comparison reviews. Some of the updates will be important for some, less so for others. Search for ""iPhone 13 mini vs iPhone 12 mini"". If you read only one, Laptopmag.com did a good real-world comparison.Long term, the 13 Mini will receive system/feature updates from Apple for about a year longer. This may be the most value added difference.Happy customer. I'm fully committed to the Mini form factor/dimensions. I carry it all day in a front or back pocket and barely know it's there. Having a phone with more screen, battery and features is nice but after the novelty wears off, having a phone that disappears into a pocket is more important for some of us. When I need to replace it, perhaps Mini's will be back in the menu from Apple. Hope so."
"TLDR: First one I got was HORRENDOUS, but seller communication was exceptional, quick, no hassle, and replacement was awesome!This is a review for the seller 'Hybrid IT', not the actual iPhone 13 mini. There are plenty of those already.I bought an 'acceptable condition' 13 mini, as I don't mind scratches and dents if it'll save a few hundred bucks. I bought from 'Hybrid IT' because they had like 99% positive ratings and I know refurbished can be hit and miss. And they had prime shipping.The one they sent was TERRIBLE. The screen was a fake LCD knockoff, the battery health was at 77%, and it was full of scratches on the screen. Far below my already low expectations.I messaged them and they offered me these options:1) replacement,2) return for full refund, or3) to refund the cost of replacing the battery at apple (which is like a third of the cost of the phone itself)They answer surprisingly quickly every time. Literally within a few minutes during the day and within a few hours at night. ____ing impressive! I needed a phone quick so we decided the best option was to buy another one (also 'acceptable', same price), and return the old one for a refund, and they would make sure to send a better one the second time.It definitely exceeded my expectations. Almost perfect condition, 98% battery, no scratches basically. I think it was a fair outcome/settlement for wasting my time with an insultingly bad one the first time. I would've been fine with 'acceptable' condition but the first one I got was not even up to par with Amazon's standards.I'm really happy with the second one and how they handle customer service. Thanks Hybrid IT!!! Oh, and this isn't a fake review! A happy customer, crazy right???"
"I bought a 13 mini in Refurbished - Excellent condition. When I received it I wasn’t all that impressed with the packaging. Simple cardboard box and surprisingly, not much protective material for the phone itself. It was simply put into a plastic sleeve and thrown in the box. It did come with a charging cube and cable. Anyways, the phone itself was in pretty good condition. Perfect screen. The back of the phone was also pretty perfect minus a few scratches. The perimeter of the phone however had some damage but again, nothing awful. My issue begins when I try to switch my SIM card from my old phone to this new phone. Turns out the phone I got was originally bought in China which wouldn’t be a big deal but my phone carrier is having connectivity issues. It’s completely fine on WiFi but I’m not always connected to WiFi. Either way I decided to test it out and I am indeed having connectivity issues. So, unfortunately, I will be returning this phone for that reason. I bought from the seller Woot and have decided to try buying a phone from them again once my refund is processed so I will update once I receive the newly ordered phone.— update —So I opted to instead buy from Amazon directly. I didn’t want to risk getting another foreign phone and I went with the right option. Came in great condition. There is a small scratch on the screen itself (even though I bought in “excellent” condition, but it’s seriously not even noticeable unless im actively looking for it). Battery health is at 89% which is great. The back of the phone is perfect. Was a bit dirty when I first got it but nothing a little alcohol and qtips won’t help. So far it’s working great, no issues at all. The switch from my old phone was super easy. It came in a sort of vacuum sealed plastic instead of just thrown in the box. It did only come with a charging cable though, no block. If that matters. Overall, if the option is available I would go with buying from Amazon directly instead of a third party seller to avoid any issues."
Phone works great but body was scratched a bit
"The renewed Apple iPhone 13 Pro with 128GB in Gold is a remarkable find for those seeking top-notch performance and style at a great price. Upon arrival, the phone was in pristine condition, functioning perfectly and showcasing the high standards of Apple’s refurbishment process. The 128GB of storage offers plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos, while the stunning Gold finish adds a touch of luxury to the phone's sleek design. Performance is stellar, with the iPhone 13 Pro’s powerful processor and advanced features delivering a smooth and responsive experience. The camera system captures photos and videos with exceptional clarity and detail. Overall, this renewed iPhone 13 Pro provides exceptional value and elegance, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enjoy premium features without the premium price"
"Very nice phone with like 3 very very minor scratches that you can only see if you look really close up. No dents at all. That’s fine tho since it was acceptable condition. Every works well.The battery life was 86% but that’s fine seeing that the price was $200 less than others. Face ID, camera speakers and microphone works. Phone came clean and with type c lighting charger but no charging block.  MCE SALES was the seller I highly recommend!!"
"I just got my new phone today, and i’m pretty pleased with it. It works really well, the only cons are that the back has a few splotches on it that won’t come off, and the maximum battery capacity is at 80%, and for excellent quality i expected more. But otherwise, it’s a good quality phone."
"I could not be happier wit the device sent. The iphone came in pristine condition, no visible marks and with 100% battery, which I assume was changed and if so, glad the change was made. Everything is functional and I'm extremely satisfied with the seller on this transaction. Great purchase!"
"Came in good condition. There were minor signs of use which were removed with a damp cloth. I also noticed a small scratch on the screen if you look at a certain angle, battery condition was 92%. I have been using the phone for over two months now everything is great. Recommended"
"I purchased this phone as an upgrade for myself as I desperately needed it, I saw mixed reviews on battery life but overall the conditions of the phones seemed to be good. When mine arrived I was very pleasantly surprised when it looked like it was in perfect condition, there wasn’t a single scratch dent scuff or anything of the like on this phone (Trust me I looked everywhere) the phone was clean with no fingerprints and not even dust in the speakers. I later checked the battery condition and saw that it was at a perfect 100%. The phone I got must have been leftover stock never sold from apple, and at the price point of nearly half of the MSRP of this phone when it originally released, I was extremely happy. There were 2 things that decreased my experience ever so slightly. 1: The packaging, it was pretty cheap and poor packaging and didn’t look appealing but it protected the phone and that’s what’s important ( it also came with sim ejector tool) 2: The setup process for the phone, I struggled for 3 hours to get the phone to set up properly, for some reason it would keep getting stuck and I would have to restart and reinstall all updates for the phone, it wouldn’t download my Apple ID or sync my stuff from my old phone, but eventually I came back the next day to try again and it ended up working, not sure what I did differently to fix this issue but none the less the phone ended up working perfectly in the end. One side note: I don’t believe this was a fault of the seller I think this was an Apple issue! After all, I got a brand new iPhone 13 Pro and I am extremely happy and satisfied with this purchase"
"I’ve bought refurbished phones before and not had an issue, but this was my first time using Amazon Renewed. The first phone came and had 100% battery which I was happy about, but there was a crack in the lower left corner. Disappointing, but I returned it and bought another from Amazon Renewed. The second phone had 85% battery health, which is still good, and it works perfectly.The reason I’m giving it 3 stars is the way they dragged their feet giving me my refund. I returned it, it showed it arrived at their facility on January 12, and they kept pushing out my refund date which was aggravating because now I had two phones on my credit card bill. I contacted them on Jan 28 and they told me not to worry, I’d have my refund by February 17. I said absolutely not, they had better refund me by the end of the month, or I was going to dispute the charge. The guy chatting with me reassured me I’d get my money by February 17 and I went in circles with him on this, with us both stating the same thing over again. I ended it by telling him to tell his supervisor (who he had contacted to find out about the refund), that if I wasn’t refunded by Jan 31, I would be disputing it. I had the refund by the next day.So that was a pain and started to make me feel like it was a scam. It all turned out well, but they did not make the process easy. Supposedly they have to have received it AND processed the return for me to be refunded, but it was a ridiculous amount of time and should have been done long before.That being said, I’m happily typing this review from the second phone I bought from them and it’s in great condition."
"Was a little weary of buying a phone online off Amazon, but I definitely wasn’t disappointed!Couldn’t find anything close to the low cost. I paid for this top quality phone, which was exactly as described and works perfectly better battery life than I expected. Better quality than I expected. Absolutely perfect couldn’t ask for anything better!"
I’m happy with the order there was no damageP working just fine and perfect
"Battery was at 79%, provided charger is a slow charger but new apple devices don’t even have that so no complaints. The phone itself was in mint condition, looked new to me in a non Apple package."
"I honestly can’t say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!"
"I have been using the phone for a few days now and have been very pleased.Good batter life, came with screen protector already installed, no cosmetic damage, charges great and haven’t noticed any heat issues or battery problems.When I use the camera, the flash on the back seems to cause a weird fog effect- though this may just be due to my phone case choice :)Touch screen works perfectly, connected without issue to my unlocked phone carrier.The packaging was good and box arrived without damage. Came with the phone itself- with a tempered glass screen protector installed, and a charging cord (no block).**November 27th; still working great so far! Still in great condition, no glitching, no issues. The battery does drain quickly if I am using the phone for games or watching videos; however, this is perfectly normal for any phone. Data takes energy :). This is a GREAT option for someone with a low budget, and isn’t picky about a USED item not being brand new out of the box (be realistic)."
"okay, it came In a weird packaging so I was suspicious it was absolutely wonderfully packed tho. it came in a small box, iphone in bubble wrap and then a lighting cable to charge in a plastic bag. the screen had no scratches, the back was wonderfully brand new, I chose yellow . It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase! I am not a big reviewer and nor do I type but this is worth to help others make the best decision I’ve made. Seems very unrealistic with the price but it’s very legit ."
"I recently purchased the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed, and overall, I’m quite satisfied with my purchase. Here are my thoughts:Pros:Great Value: For a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. The price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.Battery Health: The battery health was at 90% when I received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.Camera Quality: The camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice. Just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product."
Bought as a up grade to my wife’s phonePhone is in really good condition with good battery lifeI would definitely buy again if the need arose
"So far I have no complaints! Physically the phone is pristine ,not a mark.It charged 100%. It set up just fine, all the apps loaded and software fully updated. I didn’t expect perfection, but, so far, I’m pretty close!"
Phone looks brand new .This supplier provides phone with 100 percent battery life so worth of moneySo far phone is working good.Phone came with charger. No scratches.
"This phone looks are performs like a new phone; Not a scratch, mark, or blemish to be found."
"Exactly as described and pictured, no hassle transaction! Fast shipping, well packaged! Worked well never had any issues, do not use anymore but did for about 2 years and still have as a back up! Would buy again!"
"I purchased the unlocked iPhone XR 64GB unlocked renewed premium. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The outside of the phone is flawless, it looks brand new. The battery is 96% of original capacity and it operates without issue. Only problem was a shipping delay, but the seller promptly refunded the extra I paid for expedited shipping. Overall a great experience and great seller. I highly recommend."
The phone is perfect!!! Perfect condition. Smooth as butta!! Perfect for my holidays lol. For sure!!! Thank you and have a happy holidays!!!!
"I have had this product for a few years and it still runs well enough to keep for now. Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device's performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get the most out of their money."
"Used as a business phone, good camera, good price for money, battery life healthy, fast charging"
"Basically like a brand new phone. Mine came without any scratches, dents, or anything like that. Battery is amazing, totally worth the money, and zero lag. I’ve dropped it plenty of times and its fine :)."
"The exterior is in perfect condition and so far it’s operating like my previous one iPhone XR. I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen."
This is my first iphone. I've always had an Android phone. I am some impressed with this phone. Battery holds a good charge. 90% efficacy in the health department. It arrived undamaged and looked super clean. Just like a new phone would. I love it!
The phone was in perfect condition. The battery life is at 90%. I’m very happy with our choice of saving a few dollars by getting these phones or other options.
"Received with 88% battery life, which is very good. Little to no scratches on the glass and frame. Everything works. This iphone 11 pro even through a couple years old is way faster and zero freeze or lag. Stick with iOS.Returned a brand new flagship android phone because of google maps lags and everything is unoptimized."

Phone Works Great 100% Maximum Battery Capacity Took 2 Days To Come In … Thanks Very Much"
"The iPhone 11 Pro is nice. Everything works. EXCEPT, neither volume button work on the side. Or my button on the side to put the phone on silent doesn’t work either!! And when my phone is on the Lock Screen, I can’t slide my camera open.And I’m having battery problems. It charges super fast. But if I don’t put it on low battery mode, my phone will jump from 90% to 10% in a matter of a few minutes. And my phone dies on 7% everytime. Just aggravating when this was supposed to be a phone that went through all the “test”. Apparently not because it would’ve failed these test."

Bought this phone as a gift for someone. It works well, has all the necessary features and came in pretty good condition, no scratches or cracks. Only thing the battery percentage came at 95%"
"Ships fast, phone look and operates like new!I would buy from them again!!!Great service thank you!!!"
Perfect condition. Exactly as advertised.
Brought for a friend she loves it over her original 8 promax
"Don't understand why people buy new, Fantastic Apple 11, $400 ApproximatelyNot a scratch, and Battery 100%thought would have to replace the batteryFantastic, love it, was Samsung for over 30 YearsNot any more"
"After 12 years of faithful service, the decision was made to retire our Sony KDL-46HX850( 46-inch 1080p/240Hz) TV.Being one of the early ""Smart"" TV's on the market, it's limitations over the years became greater and greater, despite providing one of the best quality picture experiences ever, this includes, but is not limited to;Apps - It came with only a handful of Apps installed, like YouTube, Internet Browsing, and Netflix. Sadly this particular TV does not allow you to download or add additional ones. Nor have said Apps updated for at least 5 years. Netflix opens and works once in a while, usually requiring multiple restarts to load.Soundbar Issues - In late 2020 we added a 7.1 Nakamichi soundbar to our setup, after our previous Vizio 5.1 system we bought shortly after the TV died. However changing channels too quickly caused the station to lose sound, requiring a complete restart of the TV and Soundbar to allow sound to flow from the TV HDMI output.Tried using Roku, but again, it never worked properly on this particular TV. It was tested however in two different Samsung models; the 2014 UN65H7150 65-Inch 1080p 240Hz, and a 2019 QN82Q90RAFXZA 82-inch 4K 120Hz and it worked fine on those two TVs.So lets' get into the actual review for this model listed in the headline....PROS:First Impressions: Lightweight; weighs less than my 46-inch, although it doesn't have the gorilla glass my old one had. Thinner by about 3-5mm overall.Remote; approx half the size of my 2019 Samsung model with dramatic improvements - C type rechargeable port versus requiring regular batteries, and even has a photo-electric eye to allow sunlight recharging system on the back of the remote. Disney+ and Amazon Prime single app buttons added.Picture Quality; outstanding for obvious reasons; 1080p vs 4K; meaning twice as many lines of resolution. HDR which means greater color space, allowing for a wider range of colors to be displayed. Despite being only half of the frequency response of my previous set (120Hz vs 240Hz), I wanted to be sure this would not be a ""noticeable"" issue, so I tested this thoroughly out using movies from my personal collection that had heavy/intense action sequences, no ghosting or pixelation was detected.Sound Quality; Have never used just the standard included back-facing speakers, so I cannot comment, always have used Soundbars.Set-Up; Again this is such a breeze now compared to just a few short years ago, logging into Apps with QR codes on your phones versus typing everything out. From the time I had the unit on the wall and first powered up, until all software updates and Apps were added and logged into was less than 30 minutes. Added 6 different Apps that are used on daily basis in our household.This is now the 2nd Samsung Q90 model I've purchased in the last 4 years, and I believe they are worth every single penny. But to be fair.....I must point out the negatives.CONS:Viewing Distance - to gain the full 4K experience at my current TV size (50"") I need to be no further than 6ft away, which means I need to be sitting towards the middle/end of my bed. Whereas with my old unit, thew viewing distance was nearly double, meaning I could be lying down normally and not notice a drop in picture quality.4K vs 1080p; when watching standard definition programming (480p), my old 1080p TV wins hands down, the additional upscaling done by 4K TV's makes to my eyes, the picture less enjoyable. It's just something I've gotten used to over the years. It stuck out heavily when I bought my first 4K, watching cable channels broadcasting in 480p resolution. Since most shows/movies cable and streaming services are at least HD quality, it still upscales, where again watching on a 1080p gave a better experience in my opinion.Sound; Let's be honest, all HDTV's have terrible or barely passing audio, since they are backward facing. You are better off buying an inexpensive forward facing soundbar versus using the included speakers only. If you can afford it (and have the space), buying a 5.1 or 7.1 soundbar system is the way to go.All three of my household TV's are Samsung models, although I have had quite a few Sony models in the past, reviews between brands when I am shopping for a replacement have been pushing me steadily towards Samsung.Two terrible experiences have permanently soured me ever buying LG ever again."
"From our title, you may have caught on we kind of like this TV. Honestly, it’s the nicest TV we own, and we have a few between our home and our lake house. I think the price when bought on sale around the holidays is a great price proposition for excellent picture quality, features and size and the cost. Since we have a couple other Samsung TV’s, we were used to the basic remote and smart features. But this QN90C is so much faster, responsive and feature rich, that it is a clear winner. We have been pleased with our Q70B 65” TV at our cottage that we got 2 years ago, but this QN90C we got for home this past Christmas is so much better.We liked it so much that when our oldest adult son was also looking for a new TV around the holidays, we highly recommended this one. He ended up buying one too on sale and loves it. We mainly stream and watch YouTube TV. He mainly games. For both households, it’s a great option.Great picture quality! 4K as well as upscaling 1080p is excellent. When something is in 4K, it’s perfect! Has so many features. The smart-calibration system you can do with your phone is very worthwhile in dialing it in easily. It integrated very nicely with our in wall 5.2 speaker system and receiver via an optician cable. I could just go on and on about all the different features, as they are work as advertised.And although many people complain about the Tizen smart styles, we don’t mind it. Like others, I think I prefer the layout of it on our 2 year older Q70 vs the newer layout on this 2023 QN90. That is totally a layout preference on our part. That said, the range of free stations if you will, and the versatility of the layout are very nice. And, once you get used to the layout, its works well.Frankly the only drawback is that two years ago when we had to replace our cottage TV, I went with the Q70. I thought that was nice until I got this QN90, and now I wish I had spent a little more back in 2020 to get a Q90 back then at the other place. That said, I would wait for holiday sale pricing. The discount is worth waiting for."
I’m absolutely obsessed with this TV! It’s movie time all of the time- even in my bright living room. I had professional installation and a slim mount. I love that I can see the tv from anywhere in my open floor plan. I bought another big brand previously and returned it. The sound on this tv is unmatchable. No need to get a sound system. It’s a beautiful tv and I’m so happy!
Great picture and I love this TV! Easy to use and great quality!
"I just moved to a new city and in setting up my new place to live, I decided that I was going to indulge myself and set up a serious home theatre. This screen is, obviously the centerpiece.I did a lot of research and it felt like this QLED television would hit the right balance of quality, size and price and it most definitely has. It's a gorgeous screen and the set up has it about 12 feet from my sofa so it literally feels cinematic! One thing I would suggest is that, if you're wanting to set it up for hardcore movie watching, dig through the settings and set picture mode to ""Filmmaker Mode"". It's stunning!I opted not to get a cable TV package here because I was planning on doing everything via streaming, so far, so good. My set up is an AppleTV 4K to handle all of the streaming with a stereo pair of Dolby Atmos capable HomePod 2 speakers which work perfectly for the room size.Now as to why I say ""almost perfect"" in the headline: What I really wanted (and, sadly, I'll never be able to get) is not a ""smart TV"". Since I want to be able to handle the streaming through an external device and have the sound running through external speakers, what I wish I could've bought was a stripped down version of this panel with no speakers and no ""smart"" features. Basically a very very high end large monitor. The TV is enabled with Alexa (which I don't use) and its own App Store (which I also don't use) and some decent speakers (which have never been used since I set up the system). I really wish TV manufacturers would make simple, high quality stripped down  televisions with advanced picture settings but none of the rest of it.Now I'm going to go watch something 4K and loud!"
"Beautiful cris and clear pictures with various picture modes.  Color is excellent.  Whoever was involved with design of remote control should be fired.  It’s solar powered and solar battery on back so requires turning remote facedown and charging it in light. No indicator when power low.  Just stops suddenly and requires charging, so unable to even turn off what watching.  Smart features not intuitive and can be confusing.  Requires extensive setup. Still, was buying for picture quality and not disappointed.  Bought a 43” Q60A for bedroom and liked the picture but the 65’ Q70A is superior in picture quality.  A bit pricey, but worth it for picture quality compared to less expensive models I’ve tried.  Overall, a very nice TV ."
"This television is stunning.  The picture makes me want to watch something on TV.I bought the 75 inch version and it fit my oddly shaped living room perfectly.  It's like it belonged there the entire time.When I had received the TV, it was delivered right into my living room and the delivery person made sure that I was happy with what I had received before leaving.  I then connected it to the Internet and applied some updates before setting it up on its wall mount.  I can't say enough nice things about this TV.While I would have preferred having a few more buttons on the controller, using the software and voice control options aren't bad.  As I have another older Samsung TV, I was pleased to see that the old controller works perfectly on the new TV.  That was just a nice perk."
"I did my research and read up tv reviews before I decided on this sammy instead of sony. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. The TV arrived nicely packaged. Upon cutting open the box, I noticed the protecting film was missing from the screen, but did not find any visible defects. Turned it on and went through the set up process (is it just me? why the heck do I have to set up an online account in order to use my TV??!!) other than account thing, the set up was relatively smooth. It picked up my xfinity tv box and lg sound bar, and my non-brand android tv box too after some tweaking. I did not like the picture out of the box, had to adjust the color to my taste. Everything looks good except the viewing angle. I read the review saying that it is not that good(7 out of 10) but it is REALLY not good. Color is so washed out from like 40 degree angle. I would only give it maybe 5 or 6 because my older vizio tv has better viewing angle than this thing. The remote works surprisingly well. After some digging, I am able to use it to control the tv, sound bar and the android tv box, works better than my Logitech remote."
"I always wanted a big television and this is it. I had it delivered and installed and have absolutely no regrets. I just binge watched my favorite series and loved the huge display. It’s like being right there in the scene. I don’t even have to wear my every day glasses to watch this thing! The super bowl was so much more fun watching it on this monster display. It’s got a ton of apps and functions and it walks you through every setup step by step. The coolest thing is the solar powered remote! I don’t know why nobody thought of that before. The installer was so puzzled by it., he kept looking for the batteries until I grabbed the remote. When I saw the solar panel on the back we both were amazed. No more batteries!I can’t say enough good things about this television. This is by far my best online purchase ever!"
Awesome product with great features.
"This 50"" Neo QLED TV has fantastic picture quality.Definitely worth the price.I have had many Samsung TVs and Monitors.  On all of these, there is not one single dead or stuck pixel.So screen quality is excellent."
"Greetings,Have not turned it on.  Delivery was great.  I went through the initial setting.  Picture looks Great.  Easy setup.  Have went thru lots of TV's since 1986.Hoping this will be the best.Chief"
"This has been a horrible experience, wish I could rate the product but after botched delivery attempts without messaging, not delivered when promised and when finally arrives I had to chase the FedEx guy for a block because even though I answered the vestibule-phone he left before I got down to the lobby of my apartment building. So instead of getting on 4/26 as originally promised, I finally got it on 4/30 and took the time to set it up but any app I choose gets ""Smart Hub is being updated."" message. So have been on the phone, in text message and in online Samsung support chat for 3 hours this morning while they all have me go through the exact same troubleshooting steps repeatedly that do nothing to resolve it. I get a Samsung rep on the phone who remotes-in and does all the checking and troubleshooting steps himself on my screen, reboots, etc. but problem is still not resolved, I still can't use any apps. So his solution is to have a service rep come out but the earliest is 5/6 which means I have no functional tv for the next 5 days after spending $2k+, waiting 4 days, spending hours setting up and several more hours on the phone with Samsung reps who could not get the apps to work. I actually do use my tv for cardio workouts which is necessary for my health but now have to wait 5 days just to use this brand new tv. this whole situation STINKS."
Beautifully sharp picture with vibrant color and depth!
Like the picture right out of the box and easy setup.
"I replaced a 3 year old Samsung with this unit. The depth, color and clarity are so much better then the previous model. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a top notch 85 inch"
