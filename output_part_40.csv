"This isn‚Äôt just any bag; it‚Äôs the Swiss Army knife of duffle bags, and I‚Äôm pretty sure it has more features than my last smartphone! At first glance, it looked like an unassuming bag, but as soon as I opened it, I knew I was in for a wild ride.First off, it‚Äôs huge! I mean, we‚Äôre talking enough space to fit my entire gym wardrobe, a snack stash for a small village, and maybe even my dog (not that I would take him to the gym‚Äîhe‚Äôd just judge me for trying to lift weights). This bag can hold everything you need for a workout, plus those questionable protein snacks that I swear taste better after a solid lift session.The compartments? Oh boy, it‚Äôs like a treasure map! I can keep my sweaty gym clothes separated from my fresh, clean gear (because who wants to smell like a gym sock all day?). And there‚Äôs a pocket for my shoes, which I‚Äôm convinced was designed specifically to contain the shame of my last-minute decision to hit the treadmill instead of the couch.Now let‚Äôs talk about the style. This bag is slick! It‚Äôs got that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to crush goals, not just the treadmill‚Äù vibe going on. Strutting into the gym with this beauty slung over my shoulder makes me feel like I‚Äôm starring in my own action movie‚Äîcomplete with dramatic music and slow-motion hair flips (even if my hair is more ‚Äòwindy disaster‚Äô than ‚ÄòHollywood glam‚Äô).The durability is impressive too! I accidentally dropped it out of my car while getting my stuff together (don‚Äôt ask), and it landed with a thud that would‚Äôve sent lesser bags crying for their mamas. But the Sports Duffle Bag? It just shrugged it off like, ‚ÄúIs that all you got?‚Äù If it can survive my clumsy moments, it can survive anything!In conclusion, if you need a gym bag that can hold everything from your gym gear to your dignity after that last set, the Sports Duffle Bag is the perfect pick. Just be prepared for it to become your new best friend‚Äîbecause let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs way more supportive than my workout buddy who always wants to ‚Äòtake it easy‚Äô!"
"Big bag, with Decent material, little thin but good for kids sports and gym sessions. Good bag for the price."
"Got it for my Grandson to carry his martial arts gear, uniform etc.Does the job very well."
"Have had gym bag for a few months and part of handle already coming apart ...not of the best quality!....UPDATE: After posting this review on the bag's handle quality, the seller reached out and sent me a replacement bag..now THAT is excellent customer service!"
"It is well constructed I like the size, I love the quality.It holds a lot more than you would' think it is used everyday to go to the gym. Very nice for the price"
It's smaller than I thought it would be but it's a nice small gym bag
"Liked the price. Probably still worth it. I just noticed that have a few weeks of use, the inside of the side pocked is tearing apart. The zippers also stick but that actually seems to have gotten better with time. You can tell its cheap material, but I concluded that you get what you pay for and it still works. My LL Bean one lasted for 30 years, no comparison. After 30 years it was still desirable enough for someone to steal it on the subway. No one will steal this one at least."
"I'm really impressed with this gym bag's design - it's black with vibrant orange highlights. It offers plenty of space and features pockets with durable zippers. Plus, there's a special compartment for my shoes. The straps and handles feel very strong.The only downside might be that the material of the bag is a bit thin. While this keeps it lightweight, I wouldn't use it for heavy items. However, it's ideal for carrying clothes and other gym essentials. All in all, it's a stylish gym bag that I plan to use for my lighter items like clothing and shoes."
"This gym bag is long in width (20.87"") and about square (10.63"" x 10.63""). The quality of material is good and the zippers work well. I like that it has a strap that could hang the bag onto a luggage handle. Thus it  is good for travelling. The shoe compartment is made of waterproof fabric. It comes with a shoulder strap. It is useful when carrying bulky stuff but not too heavy, like clothing and shoes will be very good. I am happy with it. Would recommend."
"Nice Bag with storage options, the shoe compartment is nice because it doesn't have to take up any space if you don't need it, but it gives a separate compartment for shoes or dirty laundry that is also vented.  The pictures in the listing show most of the features, overall very happy with it.  We'll have to see how it holds up, but it looks good."
"I bought this specifically because i wanted to have a bag that can fit in a locker, a bag that i can store my lunch, my scrubs and work-shoes/clogs, a bag that i can easily strap on the back of my motorcycle, etc.It looks small but it really can hold many things and is so useful.The quality is nice, it looks great, the zippers work and it just basically an all around duffel bag that can be used for many purposes be it the gym, a sleepover or in my case as a nurse bag for work.Shipping was quick, product came well packaged. Definitely worth the buy."
"Love this bag I use it all the time at the gym. Small but fits everything I need including a pair of sneakers, towel and extra clothes to change. Looks good too."
"Bought this for my daughter for her track season to carry all her stuff and multiple pairs of shoes. Great quality bag and held up to everything she put it through, definitely enough space to hold everything she needed, including her meds, inhaler k tape etc. When she needs a new one we will definitely be getting another one for her."
Little small but is great for my husband work bag
This is a great bag for the price. Well made but it definitely is made more for a kid and not an adult. Probably my fault for not reading the dimensions.
"Great size , even small enough for over the top on plane . (Carry-on size)"
This is a great little duffle bag. I bought it for my golf shoes and a few other odds and ends that I need for the course. I liked it so much that it quickly turned into my weekend bag.
Quality is good. True as descriptions.
Lovely design & compact.  Ideal size for my partners work bits & lunch box etc
"It‚Äôs the perfect size to fit in a gym locker but still fit workout clothes, normal clothes, shower sandals, a small towel, and stuff in the pockets. It‚Äôs been durable for a lot of use, it looks good, there are tons of useful pockets but they also don‚Äôt get in the way of the main compartment. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that there‚Äôs no shoulder cushion for the strap and also the strap can flop around, but I fixed that with a rubber band and I guess I don‚Äôt need a shoulder cushion that much. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd use this for travel, would probably be just a little small for that."

"I LOVE this bag. I used it daily for the gym, and as a powerlifter, it is roomy enough to hold my squat belt and miscellaneous items without buying an XL gym bag. I have also used this for traveling on work trips, and this has served as a great carry on. It has a sleeve so it can sit on top of your suitcase while moving through the airport. It has enough pockets for easy organization. One side of the bag works as a shoe storage, and the other for your water bottle or phone. I‚Äôve had this for months now and have tossed this in and out of my car and around hotels and gyms. Very durable. There‚Äôs been no problems with the zippers or the material ripping with time. 10/10 bag"
"This bag came in quickly. The bag itself is a great size, not too big and not too small. It has great space for your shoes, clothes, and workout equipment. The material is good quality and the zippers are all perfect. There are pockets and spaces to place keys, gloves, earphones etc. Really great purchase I am happy with."
"his is hands down the best gym bag I‚Äôve owned after months of searching. The Peacock Blue color perfectly matches the photos, and the material feels sturdy and well-made. The design is stylish, and the bag is comfortable to carry, whether in hand or over the shoulder. The numerous pockets allow me to organize everything, from wet clothes to personal items like my phone and charger.However, I do have one suggestion for improvement: the shoe compartment. While it effectively separates my shoes from other items, the bottom of the bag could use more structure. When carrying heavier items like shoes and sandals, the bag can lose its shape. Despite this, I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others"
"I'm a firefighter and work 24hr shifts, sleeping overnight at the station 3-4 days a week. Needed a bag that would hold extra clothes, toiletries, Tupperware/food, and some gear; this bag fits EVERYTHING with no problem. I carry a lot with me, and still have not achieved filling this bag to the max. Looks are deceiving, because when it first arrived it looked small. But this can hold SO MUCH. It's fantastic! The side compartments are so useful too. 10/10, highly recommend this bag, either for travel, work, daily commute, etc. Easy to grab by the two short handles or by the strap. Love love love!"
"10/10 would recommend. Needed a new gym bag, this one is great quality for the price (zippers, fabric, straps are all strong). Love the numerous pockets. Extra perk: lovely colors to choose from‚ÄîI chose the dark green and it looks exactly like the photo."
Great color and perfect for the gym. I love the shoe compartment and the lined inside pocket for dirty clothes or things that might leak
"My kid was begging for these shoes and I finally gave in, they are super cheap for what they are and I honesty want them for myself. The quality is great, she wears them in PE and outside playing, true to size and the style is great for any outfit. The color doesn‚Äôt ware or tare and they aren‚Äôt very heavy while walking. Great purchase!"
"These sneakers are super comfortable and look good with jeans, leggings or even a casual dress.  They do run about a half size big.  I am usually a size 8 but went with a 7 1/2 after reading reviews and so glad I did.  Still roomy and comfortable."
"I absolutely love these shoes. Very high-quality perfect value for the moneyThe comfort is perfect and they are true to size. I always worry about flat shoes since I have a high arch, but my feet are so comfortable with or without socks.They are so trendy I‚Äôm gonna buy more colors!"
I love these - they‚Äôre stylish and comfortable and make me feel like I‚Äôm not 100 years old but also not trying to be 20. I wish the shoestrings weren‚Äôt quite so long - I have to double knot them and they‚Äôre still pretty long even with the knot.
"This shoe is very cute and confortable. It does make your feet feel a bit wider, but I have no problem with it that. It‚Äôs also on the heavy side, and it doesn‚Äôt have the most flexible sole, so I don‚Äôt recommend it for very long walks. It does look very nice with shorts, dresses or pants, and it‚Äôs built well. Fair value for a great quality shoe!Quick shipping also tops it up! Buy it!"
"These are very comfortable and they go with everything.  I wear these a lot to work and they are holding up.  I clean them with a damp cloth and they look like new again.  Only negative is that they do run slightly big in length, not in width.  I would size down a half size to 9.5 if I buy again."
These shoes are so cute and versatile! I want to love them! BUT right out of the box I am not finding them to be comfortable at all. In face they‚Äôre a bit painful. The top doesn‚Äôt flex when walking so it feels like it‚Äôs trying to remove my big toe at about the halfway point.  I suffered through day 1 hoping that I was breaking them in. They‚Äôre too cute to give up on yet‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll keep you posted.
I got these to replace a different brand that I had worn out.  I wear them to work and they feel great on my feet.  The heel has great cushioning and I love that around the bottom isn‚Äôt white.  I ordered my normal size and they fit perfect.
Comfy and classy
Love the fit and color. Great price!
Fit perfect for size. Fun to wear. Classic style.
Well made good fit comfortable Was well worth the long wait to arrive It‚Äôs my go to walking shoe
"These shoes are comfortable, cute, and a perfect alternative to other expensive shoes on the market (sambas). Love them"
"Last month I purchased these Adidas shoes that have completely transformed my daily strolls. These shoes epitomize comfort and style, making every step a dream.Comfort: Ô£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√º The cushioning in these shoes is unparalleled. The memory foam insoles provide excellent support, molding perfectly to the shape of my feet. I've only used it on the pavement; my feet feel like they're walking on clouds. The arch support is also fantastic, reducing any strain on my feet and lower back.Fit: Ô£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√º These shoes fit like a glove. The adjustable laces and flexible material ensure a snug yet comfortable fit without any pinching or discomfort.Durability: Ô£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√º After four weeks of almost daily use, these shoes show no signs of wear and tear. The soles are sturdy and provide excellent grip, even on slippery surfaces. The upper material is breathable yet durable, keeping my feet cool and dry.Style: Ô£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√º Not only are these shoes incredibly comfortable, but they also look great. The sleek design and variety of color options make them versatile enough to wear with any casual outfit. I've received numerous compliments on them!Overall: Ô£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√ºÔ£ø√º√•√º If you're in the market for a pair of walking shoes that combine comfort, durability, and style, look no further. These Adidas are worth every penny and have made my daily walks something I look forward to. Highly recommended!"
"So far, I have worn them about a half a dozen times. They seem well-made, attractive and fit very comfortably. I have small wide feet and got the size 9. The Tow box seemed perfectly wide and roomy for me. If they hold up, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll probably order another pair. Looks like a very good value for the price."
Got these for my son. True to size. He really likes them and says they feel great! They look nice too. Just as the picture shows. No complaints. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥d buy these again.
I like the color and there are very comfortable to my feet nice pair of shoes to have in the collection
got this for my bf and he loves it. Its true to size and the colour is as the photo
These shoes are comfortable. I ran a 5K in them and use them for practice runs. So far so good!
"These shoes look great and are very stylish. The sole is soft with light padding, making them comfortable to walk in.However, they seem to run small. For reference, I typically wear a size 11.5 US in Nike Air Force 1s, but these feel extremely tight on my feet. I recommend going half a size up for a better fit."
"I love these shoes, very easy to keep clean and very comfortable, great walking ability too."
"Little small size,but good comfort."
"I bought these sneakers expecting nothing less then terrific. Never have I been disappointed in New Balance sneakers. I bought a black pair of the 608s, I've purchased numerous styles over the years always stylish and  fit comfortably. These shoes were shipped promptly, received as described, nice quality shoe. The shoe fits perfectly, extremely comfortably and affordable. No breaking in period required.  Thanks New Balance."
"Fitz well, quality of the lather is good and comfortable. Color came clean and style is really good."
"I want shoes I can wear to walk 2-4 miles around my hilly neighborhood regularly that also are styled in such way they can be worn with most of my casual outfits- no crazy patterns or color schemes. I haven't had a pair of New Balance sneakers in a while but decided to try them again. I have trouble finding sneakers I like the look of that come in my size 10.5 (many brands just skip from 10 to 11), have the support my feet require as I am an over pronator, and are on the wider side of 'regular' width. My feet have annoying Goldilocks tendencies where it's hard to find 'just right'. These sneakers fit the bill! Right out of the box, they felt supportive and solid, very comfortable. I wore them to run errands for a few hours and completely forgot I had new sneakers on just about immediately. I couldn't be more pleased.with these,.without even the dreaded 'break in' period."
"I do like that they are black with a non-slip soul, which is very important when you work in the kitchen around food. They are comfortable, but I wish they were a little wider. I did order a wide, but it is a little tight on 1 foot I am hoping that the leather softens up and it will be OK but it is a comfortable shoe."
"I've been wearing New Balance style 608 training shoes for more than 20 years, and they never disappointed me! With more and more fabric athletic shoes on the market, it's really hard to find a good pair of training shoes that still have leather upper and provide good fit, support, traction, cousining, stability, breathability, and yet still relatively lightweight, with such a good price! Plus they look pretty and classic! They are also easier to clean compared to fabric shoes.  Thanks to New balance who's still making style 608 so we can continue enjoying our training fitness in these fabulous shoes! Please keep up the good work √∞≈∏‚Äô¬™√∞≈∏‚Äô¬Ø√∞≈∏‚Äô¬™√∞≈∏‚Äô¬Ø√∞≈∏‚Äô¬™√∞≈∏‚Äô¬Ø"
Mom loves these! She says they are so comfortable and the perfect fit!
"The style is cute, they do provide traction and they are made of leather. However,I suffer from severe foot/heel pain, suffer from planters fasciitis and these shoes , although okay craftsmanship do not work for me! They do not have much of an arch.Admittedly, I ordered the 8.5 wide because I have inserts and thought the extra width would help. It did not.These shoes probably would work well for anyone who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t suffer from foot problems but if you are looking for an arch supportive shoe, these  did not work for me."
"I always have great luck with New Balance shoes.  They are comfortable, true to size. Good quality and lasting.  Excellent price value this time because I got a great deal on Amazon Prime Days and this makes it even better!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Absolutely LOOOVEEEE my new black running shoes! But please get them 1/2 size smaller for your foot, there is A TON OF CUSHIONING and stretching. Right out of the box, these shoes felt like they were custom-made for my feet. The cushioning is exceptional, providing a perfect balance between support and softness. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve completed several long runs, and my feet have felt great every time. The traction on these shoes are INCREDIBLE. Whether I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m running on pavement or a trail, the grip is reliable and consistent. They handle sharp turns and sudden stops without any issues, making them ideal for a variety of running environments.EXTRA: After weeks of intense use, they show minimal signs of wear. The materials are high-quality and seem built to last, which is impressive considering the level of comfort they provide.Overall, these black running shoes have exceeded my expectations in every way. Highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable, stylish, and comfortable pair of running shoes!"
good quality  and strong materials.
The shoes are perfect - although I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have them.I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a pleasant experience with the seller. They sent the wrong size and in the end I returned the shoes with a lot of hassle.
Got these for my grandson and they were nice and comfortable. Perfect fit and lightweight. They look good and can be worn when he goes out.
"I‚Äôve been eying these up for a long time.Very comfortable, super light, they have so many different colors, but I went for simple navy.The only con I can see is that I‚Äôd like to tighten up the laces a little and it‚Äôs not the end of the world but a little fiddley with the elastic."
"Hey Dude shoes combine lightweight comfort with laid-back style, making them perfect for all-day wear. Their flexible design and cushioned insoles feel like walking on clouds, while the easy slip-on style keeps things casual. Ideal for anyone looking for shoes that blend effortless cool with unmatched comfort! We love HEYDUDE Shoes!!"
"Hey Dudes are all the rage right now and I‚Äôm starting to understand why. These shoes are great for everyday wear. They‚Äôre also great for wide feet. They offer lots of space in the toe box, are very lightweight and are easy to slip on and off. The only improvements that could be made would be to offer slip resistance, as they had no traction against my vinyl flooring. I also wish they were easier to tighten but the elastic laces look silly when they stick out of the sides too much after tying an extra knot. Overall, these shoes are very comfy and I like them, but I do feel theyre overpriced for what you get."
Still comfy but more of a shoe than what my other pair is.
Good quality
Incredible. Very fun to wear and so comfortable top to bottom. One of my favorite shoes
I purchased these as a Christmas gift. They were delivered in 2 days.  I'm sure the teenager will love them.  The price was great and I already know from word of mouth of friends and family; that the product has 5 stars!
"The Skechers Women's Go Walk Joy Sneaker has become my go-to shoe for daily errands and long walks. After weeks of use, I can confidently say these sneakers live up to the hype. Here‚Äö√Ñ√¥s my experience:Key Features I Loved:Incredible Comfort: The cushioned insoles feel like walking on clouds. Even after hours of wear, there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s no foot fatigue. These are perfect for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet.Lightweight Design: These sneakers are so light, I sometimes forget I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m wearing them. They make walking effortless, whether it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a casual stroll or a long day at the park.Breathable Material: The mesh upper keeps my feet cool, even in warm weather. It also provides a snug but flexible fit.Slip-On Convenience: I love the slip-on design‚Äö√Ñ√Æit‚Äö√Ñ√¥s quick and easy to put on, with no laces to fuss over.Room for Improvement:Limited Arch Support: While the cushioning is fantastic, the arch support might not be enough for those with specific foot conditions. Adding an orthotic insole could help.Durability for Heavy Use: The lightweight construction means they might not hold up well under intense, frequent use, like rigorous hiking or running.Personal Insights:I wear these shoes for everything from grocery shopping to walking my dog, and they‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been a game-changer for my comfort. They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re particularly great for travel because of their lightweight build and ease of packing. However, for activities that require more robust footwear, I switch to something sturdier.Why I Recommend It:If you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re looking for a comfortable, stylish, and versatile walking shoe, the Skechers Go Walk Joy Sneaker is an excellent choice. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s perfect for casual wear, light exercise, and anyone who values comfort over heavy-duty durability.Summary:The Skechers Women's Go Walk Joy Sneaker combines comfort, style, and practicality in one lightweight package. While it may not have the durability for intense use, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s an outstanding everyday shoe for walking and casual activities. Highly recommended for those seeking all-day comfort!"
"Do I dress like a grandmother?  Yes, I do.  I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t wear heels, because they are very uncomfortable, expensive, and downright weird.  I wear my dresses and skirts pretty long, and love the look of a clean white sneaker upon my feet, especially when they are so lightweight and comfortable.  they are great with your jeans when you are running to the grocery store, and look just as great sitting in church.  These are true to size, durable, and easy to keep clean - just throw them in the washer."
