"..... and I love them.  I love the design, the softness, and the value for my money.  You get this warm beautiful comforter that my cat and I love, as well as 2 pillow shams and a bed skirt. I buy another everytime they go on sale. Oh, and they are reversible.  I love this so much."
"I was drawn to this comforter set because of the advertised thickness in the photos, but unfortunately, itâ€šÃ„Ã´s not as thick as pictured. That was disappointing since it was the main reason for my purchase. However, I will say that the color is beautiful, and the softness is great, very comfortable to the touch. If thickness isnâ€šÃ„Ã´t a priority for you, itâ€šÃ„Ã´s a decent option."
This item is very light and does not put undo stress on your legs or feet . This is why I purchased it . Well made and very easy to put on the bed .
Love this comforter. I almost never write a review but Iâ€šÃ„Ã´m pretty impressed with this comforter so why not. I read a lot of the reviews and it looked promising - glad I got it. Itâ€šÃ„Ã´s a lot warmer than I thought it was going to be given how lightweight it was out of the box. But it still feels super cozy even though itâ€šÃ„Ã´s lighter. There were a few threads along the edges but cleaned them up by cutting them and it looks better. Washed it after a week as I have 2 dogs that are on the bed as well - it held up pretty well. Even a few blood stains from one of the dogs was washed out pretty easily with a little oxyclean pre soak. Seems to have held up to the wash well - no bleeding no clumping of the inside stuffing and no rips or tears. I put it in the dryer on a low setting. Would definitely buy again if needed.
"This comforter is lightweight and comfortable.  Itâ€™s not used as a duvet cover, itâ€™s just a great comforter. It washes great , fits the bed perfectly and seems to be of good quality. Plus it looks cute in my pink and gray bedroom."
"Super soft and just plushy enough! This insert is warm, but breathable, so itâ€™s perfect for people like me who sleep hot! The quality is great. Iâ€™m using it with the Bedsure stonewashed cotton duvet cover, I didnâ€™t buy the insert a size up from the cover, but the ties make it fit perfectly regardless! The weight is just right, I love it. Definitely worth the price!!"
I bought this insert and a cover from the same brand. The insert is on the thinner side but super comfy and it keeps me warm all night. I get cold easily haha. Great quality for the price and fit inside the cover perfectly.
"I was looking for a comforter for my bed that would make me cooler and gove more comfort because my comforter was making me sweat! Now this blanket is So Much Better! I feel much cooler, i dont have to run my air conditioner all night and Zero sweating through the night! I'm sleeping with comfort and no longer waking up throughout the night drenched!I definitely recommend this for sweaty sleepers like me! Also the price is great! For the price I was expecting something very cheap but it's not. It's decent quality. It's light weight but also would be warm enough for winter! It's performance is better than others and I really like it!"
"I am so happy I decided to order this comforter by Bedsure! Great company first of all and they sell quality products too. The comforter was vacuum sealed and when I unpacked it, it immediately puffed right up. Itâ€™s  honestly one of the best comforters Iâ€™ve ever purchased for the price! Got a really good deal during the prime sale! I ordered the green/light green color combo and itâ€™s a sea foam but darker IRL. Nice looking and its box stitching keeps the filling in place. Seriously surprised at the quality and itâ€™s perfect for Southern California Fall/Winter season. Very soft and yes I recommend! It can easily be used as a duvet insert too. Versatile and comfortable! Not cheap feeling at all. Fits my queen bed perfectly, completely recommend! 5 stars all the way!"
"Omgosh where do I start.We bought this new comforter when it was on sale. It's the very first brand new comforter I bought in 25 years. My mother in law used to give me some (sadly she always missed on the colour and patterns. Sorry. I never liked them, but as I hate waste, and didn't want to upset her, we used them lol)Anyway. I was excited to buy this ine lol.And wow. I love how soft it is. It's warm without being heavy, or stuffy.I bought the king size for our queen bed and it is perfect. The colour is absolutely gorgeous.I ran it through the fluff cycle in my dryer to take out the wrinkles and fluff it up before I put it in the bed and it worked like a charm it looks so good.I also washed it right away, to see if the batting would stay in place before the return window closed lol (and we wah our comforters regularily, like once a week, because yuck)It went through the wash and dry cycles beautifully.I liked it so much I tried to get ine for my son, but the sale was over and he picked one from a different company, but it turned out just as nice thank goodness. Lol"
"Love this Bedsure comforter! Light weight but so very warm & cozy, We have a split king adjustable bed so I ordered reg king xl, wish I had gotten oversized king & may just order another that size..the cyan color was pale teal & worked perfectly with our bedroom decor..can't say enough about how great this is!"
"This is a good quality duvet. This queen size duvet insert is wonderful and really light weight. I wanted a plush comforter, this duvet is plus and fluffy and when inserted in my microfiber bed sheets, it's  has helped me with my sleep pattern. I seem to get a better nights sleep, I don't wake during the night like I use to as much. This insert in my comforter feels more relaxing at night. This insert has 8 corner ties to secure and hold it in place. It is easy to wash, just wash it like any other comforter  or laundry items. This insert is wonderful in every way as far as I concerned.ðŸ’•ðŸ’¯"
I love purple and this comforter really looks good on my bed.
"Glad I ordered it.  Here's why:1)  It's EXACTLY as described including the color and size.  Of course, color will depend on your monitor settings, calibration and accuracy, but for mine, the color is EXACT.  I ordered the light blue which is a light steel blue.  Beautiful.  Color accuracy is not always the case with some listings.2)  VERY soft and VERY lightweight.  I've owned both Down and Alternative Down comforters for years.  This is incredibly soft and lightweight when you're snuggled under it, and it's perfect for Spring time here in California.  It will be too hot in summer when our temps get up over 100, despite AC.  It may not be warm enough for the 30-40o we get in Winter, but I think likely perfect for 6 months of the year.3)  The Fabric is SOOOOOO soft.  A pleasure to touch.4)  The size:  I wanted a BIGGER size -- but couldn't find the OVERSIZED king in this comforter, so it does not cover the entire matress on the sides, but I can turn it sideways for our Eastern King which isn't as long as a standard King and it hangs down more.  Knew this going in.  I may have to add a bed skirt as I like coverage to floor, but this won't change my mind about the comforter itself.5)  The matching Shams are a plus especially for the price.  I wish I could order more but don't see them available separately.  So coordinating ones will have to do.6)  The ONLY downside I can potentially see is wear with time.  Most alternative down comforters have closed stitching in squares or triangles in order to keep the interior fabric in place.  This doesn't.  See pic.  With use then, there is less stitching to hold the guts in place.  Time will tell.7)  Beautiful appearance.  I didn't expect it to look and feel as nice as it did.  Very pleased.8)  Would I order again -- you bet."

I recently purchased this queen bed comforter set, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way! The comforter is incredibly soft and plush, offering the perfect balance between warmth and breathability. It feels like I'm wrapped in a cloud every night, which has significantly improved my sleep quality.The design is modern and elegant, with colors that seamlessly blend into my bedroom decor. The stitching is well-done, and the material feels durable, promising to last through many washes without losing its softness or vibrant color.The set comes with matching pillows that are equally comfortable. They're fluffy and provide great support, making them perfect for lounging or adding that extra touch of coziness to the bed. I also appreciate that the set includes pillow shams, which give the bed a polished, put-together look.Overall, this comforter set has transformed my bedroom into a cozy retreat. If you're looking for both style and comfort, I highly recommend this set. It's worth every penny!"
"This is so soft and comfortable. I am very happy I bought this by accident! And it was inexpensive. Not too heavy, perfect weight and fit. A bit wrinkly right from the wash but not bad. Made well. Very Happy I did not cancel this order.Update: I noticed today, after 3 days,with some of the stitching coming undone, pulls, and tiny holes."
"This is a nicely priced, simple blanket set that is so comfy I look forward to going to bed at night. I hope your rest is as good as mine because I've enjoyed sleeping in more lately. The comforter is lightweight, but snug when wrapping up in it. Hoping it hold up well in the wash, but we'll see. The pillowcases are gentle to the skin, not rough or papery. Wasn't expecting much but very satisfied with the texture, weight, and color I chose."
I'm happy with my purchase. The comforter is the correct size. I bought a queen size for my queen bed and it seemed plenty big to me. It's also soft and warm while staying somewhat breathable. The color looks good. The only thing that's a little annoying is it's wrinkled like crazy from being packed so tight. That will come out in time though.

"Bought this on a whim and I am so glad I did. we have a regular king bed but I bought the California king size, so we had more coverage. The blanket is soft and light but keeps me (I'm always freezing) warm and comfortable. The color(grey/blue) is really pretty, and I like the detail."
Material and size small
"Fabric is much softer than expected, looks great and was easy to wash / dry. Great deal for king size and quality material for the price"
I did three hours of research to find this set and it exceeded my expectations. You really can't find equal quality at this price. I bought another set because it was so great.It comes with everything - the colors are deep and rich. I machine washed and dried both sets and they held up beautifully. The thickness of the comforter is impressive and the materials are soft and smooth. The warmth is just right and doesn't overheat.The kid I bought it for slept in two hours later than usual the first night. That alone was worth the price!
Perfect light weight set. Fits perfectly and the colors are bold and beautiful.
I bought this comforter for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. It is of very good quality and it fits very well on her twin bed. I do recommend that you buy it.
"A couple months ago, I decided it was time to retire our old, boring black comforter in our guest bedroom and get a new, colorful bedding set. I didn't want to spend a lot of money since the bed only gets used about once a month but I also wanted to buy a set that is cheerful and comfortable. I had previously purchased a couple of AmazonBasics items and had good luck with them so I was very happy to find this set. It had everything I needed in a pretty color for a good price so I ordered it!When the set arrived, I opened it right away to make sure it was a good quality and there weren't a lot of loose threads and poor stitching. There were just a couple loose threads but not enough to make me want to return it and find something else.This seven-piece full/queen bedding set includes:1 - colorful, patterned comforter (86 inches by 90 inches)1 - white flat sheet (90 inches by 102 inches)1 - white fitted sheet (60 inches by 80 inches by 12 inches)2 - white full/queen pillowcases (20 inches by 32 inches)2 - colorful, patterned standard pillow shams (20 inches by 26 inches)All of the pieces are made in China of 100% polyester, including the filling in the comforter. The first thing I noticed about this set is that it is incredibly soft, even before I washed it. After washing it, everything is even softer. I was easily able to wash all of the pieces in the washing machine and dry them without anything falling apart so I was very happy about that. We have a queen guest bed and the sheets fit nicely on the mattress, with a little room to spare.Our guests have said these sheets are comfortable and complimented us on the color and style of the comforter! This set adds just a bit of cheerfulness to our guest room and I'm pleased with it. The blue is not quite as bright as the picture online shows. It's more of a dusty blue, as suggested by the name of the color, but the online picture makes it seem more like a spa blue and I still like it. The white sheets are soft but thin and pretty much see-through. They don't feel like tissue paper but they aren't as thick as other sheets we've had. Still, for sheets that don't get used very often, I'm happy enough and if they get worn out, I will happily purchase a different set of sheets that match the set.Overall, I am very happy with this set and think it's a good buy for anyone looking to purchase a set for a guest room or for your own bed. It isn't the best quality but it's good for the price and seems to be holding up nicely in the two months we've had it. The sheets have been used for several nights already and have been washed a number of times. If anything happens that changes my mind or I have more information to add, I will update this review. It's a good set for the price!"
"My eighteen year old is pleased with the look, comfort & style. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thrilled with the price point. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be buying more for my other sons."
"I've been using this set (Twin XL version) for more than a year now and just thought I'd leave a review for those still on the verge of clicking that 'Buy Now' button. To you I say: ""BUY NOW!"" If you're on this page you're probably looking for a cheap but decent-quality set that'll get you comfortable on a new bed (including those in college dorm rooms as in my case), and this set is PERFECT for that. Please note that if you're looking for super high quality linen that'll make you feel like a princess, this might not satisfy you - it spells more VALUE FOR MONEY rather than luxury.QUICK FACTS:- FIT: The fitted sheet fits perfectly on my Twin XL college dorm bed. The provided comforter is slightly wider than my needs, but wider is always better than narrower *shrugs*. I use the pillowcases with standard queen sized pillows and they fit well.- STYLE: The blue color is not too bright and not too faded in my opinion, looks pretty good on the bed. It's not super stylish though - just putting it out there.- QUALITY: The polyester keeps me warm during cold nights, and doesn't feel extremely hot during warm ones. The fabric has held up extremely well during my one year of usage (I do wash it only once every two months though), and it seems like its can go on for an year more. One more thing to note here is that the fabric is 100% polyester, which is fine for me, but if you're someone who only prefers COTTON, its NOT for you.- EASE OF USE: Finally, the quality that makes this AmazonBasics set most lucrative for college students is that its completely machine washable: just pop it into the washer/dryer on the delicates / permanent press settings and you're good! Beats expensive brands that require particular settings or dry-cleaning. Plus, the nifty bag that the set comes in proves particularly handy when you need to pack up and change dorms or move out of college housing.SUMMARY: Great for College Students, Great for those who want a Cheap but Decent-Quality product, NOT for those looking for the Absolute Best in the market. HOPE THIS HELPS, EVERYBODY! :-)"
Love the combination of colors. Good size and soft.
The sheets and comforter are great quality. They're comfortable and fit a hospital bed perfectly. The set looks exactly like the pictures. They fit the bed well and works well. The sheets and comforter had very few wrinkles when taken out of package.
"This bedding is lovely, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the second set IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve purchased. Highly recommend. Great value."
"This is so soft!  It looks absolutely beautiful! Itâ€šÃ„Ã´s warm, itâ€šÃ„Ã´s a fantastic size for a king. Some of them seem to lack coverage but this one fits perfect. Good quality and good bang for your buck for sure! It doesnâ€šÃ„Ã´t feel or look cheap! We are very happy with this!"
"This comforter is great, and I love the color. It's exactly what I was looking for. But the wrinkles are like nothing I've ever seen! I used a steamer (the manufacturer says not to) and it helped some. I put it on my bed, and the rest of the wrinkles have slowly come out. It's very comfortable and I love the thickness. I bought a queen size for my full size bed, and it fits perfectly. Overall, I will definitely buy again."
Absolutely love it. Beautiful and soft and all for a great price. Lightweight yet very warm.
"More of a grey purplish color, so I'm disappointed in that, reason for 4 star's. Soft fluffed up great in the dryer on no heat setting. It looks like it's good quality and the pintucks are perfect, seams are nicely sewn, generous size and the cases are very nice but a bit long for my king size pillows, but that really doesn't interfere with the functionality. I just wish the true colors were what I was seeing. It's very soft and it should be easy to wash at the laundry mat, I have a top load washer and my bedding doesn't wash up that well. I do love it ï£¿Ã¼Ã²Ã„ I would recommend especially if you're looking for a grayish purple, I can't attest to the other colors. But it's more gray than purple ï£¿Ã¼Ã­Ãº"
"Love the way it feels and looks beautiful in my bedroom, The price was wonderful. Will be purchasing again."
"I rarely write reviews but I wanted to comment on this comforter to respond to other reviews about it coming all wrinkled. It does come in a vacuum package and when I took it out, I put it in the dryer for about ten minutes to fluff it out. I bought the dark green one and it is a beautiful dark green. I read a review where someone ironed their quilt to get the wrinkles out. I am not very skilled with an iron for something like that but I have a handheld steamer that I put a long extension cord on and steamed it and the pillow cases right on the bed. It came out very nice.  The quilt is so soft and comfy too. It took some work but it was worth it. I am very pleased with this purchase."
It is the perfect comforter!! I absolutely love it!! It is so cozy and comfortable!! Itâ€šÃ„Ã´s light weight and very soft! Itâ€šÃ„Ã´s so cute and goes with all of my bedroom decor! Great quality and even better price!
"Definitely doesnâ€šÃ„Ã´t look like the picture, poor quality, very light weight, good for summer but I would not recommend. Gave 3 stars for softness and light weight."
Made in Canada! I put it in the dryer on fluff cycle and puffed right up from packaging.  Soft and very comfortable.Warm and cozy.  Color is as pictured.
"This comforter set is very nice and soft! Not heavy, just perfect for cold season, very well made it ! Good price and fast shipping too ! Thanks !"
"This comforter is super lightweight, soft, and comfortable. Great value for the money and I adore the pattern!"
I ordered the King size set and it is beautiful. Iâ€™m obsessed. Itâ€™s so soft and comfortable; not thin and cheap. Great quality. This may be a bit warm for summer but honestly it wasnâ€™t so bad since I always run the air conditioning. This will be perfect for winter. The colors are gorgeous. This set was better than I expected. I highly recommend.
"Very lightweight but still enough so you wonâ€™t be cold. Good for those who live in hot states looking for one, coming from a Texas girl. Our winter comforter was expensive so I wasnâ€™t looking forward to spending a lot of money on a lightweight one for the summer heat. This gets the job done, looks so good, and feels soft. Good value for the cost. Fits our queen bed perfectly without being too long or too short. The quality serves its purpose for the price. So far is holding up well against our crazy kitten! Bonus that it comes with two shams because I have to have matching decor pillows."
"Absolutely love this new comforter. It's soft and great quality for the price. It doesn't get too hot and my partner heats up a ton at night but I still feel cool under this. I do wish it had slightly more fill to it as it seems kind of flat but really isn't a big deal to me, the colors are beautiful and I will definitely purchase from this brand again."
"I purchased the Coconut White, in the Queen size. I wanted it for the winter, to brighten up the bleak and cold season. It fits well and so soft. I havenâ€™t experienced getting it stained yet, but Iâ€™m sure it will be stain resistant. I also like the fact it is reversible. The colors are vibrant, in the flowers in the pattern and the reverse side is strips. It doesnâ€™t emit any odors and I must reiterate, itâ€™s soft and cozy! I did purchase another comforter, in Infinity Blue. It is on my bed now and it looks great!"
I love it! Its soft and beautiful.  Has enough overhang on each side of the bed. King version. Love the color and pattern. Is warm and cool at the same time.
I have had a great experience with this brand for the most part. All bedding comes just as pictured with really pretty colors. BUT the only thing I don't like about this comforter is that it feels like a polyester material and it traps heat so we wake up verrrry sweaty. It does look great on the bed! We may look for a different material one in the future from this brand.
"Looks nice and for winter or autumn, comfortable, decent quality for the price,"
"This lightweight comforter looks expensive and feels great. I am pleased with the quality. It is just a touch warmer than I was expecting, but should work great in the cooler months. It's still very lightweight, and may be perfect for most people."
We live this comforter. It is light and fluffy yet retains warmth when the house drops in temperature to( 63) degrees. Not a fan of heaviness on my feet when sleeping and this is perfect.
"This is advertised as keeping you cool, and it's better than some comforters, but still too warm for me. The quality is good, stitching is good, sizing is correct and the colors don't run in the wash."
"It's my current favorite blanket. The fabric is smooth and comfortable and none of the stitches have come out. It's not super heavy or thick. I personally run warm and this has never gotten too warm for me, but still keeps out the cold. I've been layering it with another blanket as the weather gets colder."
"I love these comforters. I have a white one and I just ordered the black one. Someone suggested to size up, I went with a King for my Queen size mattress and LOVE the extra size. It covers my whole mattress perfectly. This is not too heavy and the fabric is very soft. They are super easy to clean as well!"
"Bought a duvet cover and it worked great inside, very fluffy but also easy to make the bed too."
"Stitching started coming undone within the first month of using it. However, it is comfortable and lightweight!"
"I was in need of a new comforter, and this one was on sale for a great price, so I decided to go with it after reading many positive reviews. A big issue I was having with my last comforter, was it constantly bunching up in one area of the blanket, and after a while, it just stayed stuck like that. The comforter essentially became useless aside from having the bare minimum covering you. That was a huge factor in what I was looking for in a new one. I am also a hot sleeper - was looking for something lightweight, but still comfortable, as well. So far, I am loving this one. It is lightweight, snug and comfortable. The square patching will prevent the inside from bunching up, which is crucial. I am not overheating in it either, which is great. It is cooler fall temps now where I am in Canada - but I imagine this will still be ideal for me come winter. Canâ€™t say for summer temps at this point. This would work on its own without a duvet cover just fine, but I did purchase one anyway for aesthetics. I highly recommend it!"
"This queen comforter is exactly what I was looking for. Stylish, lightweight, and extremely comfortable ~ it's very soft."
I bought this for my Dad and he really loves it
"It's a good size and the color is on point. The material is life a sleeping bag, very light but still keeps you warm."
This is a lightweight comforter that my husband is loving! The soft grey color is not overpowering. The queen size fits perfectly. The quality is nice was well.
Arrived on time and actually much bigger than i anticipated! Its soft and not to heavy and not to light. I love it.
"This comforter is fairly thin, it is soft. It would be perfect for a dorm room or teenager. I would not recommend for an adult room. The quality is not the greatest"
I am very pleased with the quality of this comforter!
Recipient loved it!!!
"Nice sizing for a king size, I usually find that when I buy a comforter, itâ€™s a little short on the sides because I have a high mattress, but this one seems to fit just right, It is also very soft and And looks like it will be easy to clean. Also, itâ€™s not too thick or too thin. Itâ€™s just right , very happy with my purchase."
Enjoying the light weight yet warm. Love the colour and material
"This comforter is great, it's lightweight but not paper thin.  Way softer than I expected too.  I washed and dried it on normal and it was just fine.  I'm pleased with this purchase."
I absolutely love these frames. They look nice and are easy to style. I love that itâ€™s not real glass and they wonâ€™t break (I move a lot and have gone thru so many frames). Easy to clean and easy to switch out photos. Highly recommend!
Got this for my new place! The quality is great! Worth the money. Easy to use! Size as desired! Definitely recommend for my friends!!
