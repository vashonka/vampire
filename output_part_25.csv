We just received the glassware set!  All of them beautiful and beyond my expectations. We will be enjoying these hopefully for many years.
"Loved the glasses. However, shipping did not hold up. I bought two sets. On set large glasses were broken-bits of shattered glass leaked through the box and I had to clean up. The seller quickly returned new glasses and they too included broken glasses.  I would suggest that the seller revisit the way they ship this product. The glasses were double boxed with some large bubble wrap. Needs much better packaging. Those bits of glass hit the floor and animals could be harmed. Fortunately I was able to vacuum the floor before any damage done-again the glasses were of great quality, value, and appearance. Just be careful when opened"
Packaged poorly. Arrived today with broken cups. Completely shattered. I was able to salvage some of them.  The cups that were not broken were heavy & nicely designed. Very happy with the cups.
"I love these things, especially after not having stackable glasses for so long! I recently downsized my unmatched glassware and bought a set of these to replace the cups that were culled.These glasses look great, are thick enough to be decently sturdy and I love the pattern on the sides. That being said, these ARE glass and I already have lost one to a careless child, but with concerns about plastic used for food service, I have been cutting out most of the plastics in my kitchen where feasible and these are great enough that I will buy a whole second set as soon as I have enough room for them,"
"These are heavy and don't feel like they'll chip easily. They look nice, too. We'll use them mostly for water... wine in a pinch ; )"
We use these for every holiday table setting. Very durable and pretty. Perfect for all ages. Hold up well.
Love these tea goblets. Have used this style for years since my first cruise experience. They add an air of class to any table. Great price and fast shipping. Buy them!
"These are great goblets.  They have a sturdy base and a generous bowl.  They are heavy and well made.  They came exceptionally well packed - no chips, no cracks, no breakage."
These glasses are a great quality. Nice and thick. Very well-made.
"These are great glasses, nice weight and multi purpose for formal or informal, iced water or iced tea etc. However, One glass did arrive broken. Working on receiving a replacement!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



These are perfect. Think, well packaged. Not one was broken. I like them. A little thicker and a little heavier than the store bought ones."
"I LOVE these glasses. I bought them to serve sangria in, because I didn’t want to use my good crystal wine glasses, and they’re so pretty I’ll be using them all the time. Great for ice tea, too, and they go with every style decor. Glasses came quickly and in perfect condition."
"Exactly what was pictured, reasonable price."
"Super Impressed!Not one crack or break on delivery! Only shipped in thick cardboard box, I thought for sure they would all br broke - Nope!! Not the one.Very sturdy thick glass!I will re-order! Love them!"
They're the perfect size wine or water goblet or cocktail if you prefer.  Substantial weight that you won't knock over but a little elegance.
Glasses nice and thick.. Encourage the kids to drink more water.. We all love them.
"This line has been my favorite for years, I love that I can use ice in this goblet and still have lots of space for water."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I ordered and returned several other brands (because the quality was terrible), before landing at these. These were the most affordable and the best quality! And I really inspect every detail. The “thickness” of the bottom part of the glass was important to me. I wanted rocks glasses that had a thicker bottom because I had ordered some other brands where the bottom was thinner and they had a cheaper look to them.. Other brands had a lot of rippling in the glass but the quality of these glasses were great.One of the glasses had a tiny flaw in the glass, but you wouldn’t notice unless you’re reallyyyy inspecting it, under the right lighting. I used all 12 to fulfill an order for a customer. I will DEFINITELY keep ordering these for my small business!"
We needed a lot of glasses for a party and buying these was so much cheaper than renting from an event company. Classic all-purpose design.  And they’re well packed so no damage in shipping. Would totally buy again.
Great glasses that are solid and very sturdy.  They are nice and simple.
Weighted just right and a nice feel
Just like the description these are heavy bottom glasses they feel more stable and do not tip off easily when bumped accidentally. They are very good all around glasses whether used for water or for scotch
Good quality but concerned about thin rim chipping in future.
These glasses are excellent. Little story. One fell on concrete and still didn’t break. Thanks seller excellent product.
"I purchased these to replace a couple that had been broken.  Well packaged and slightly smaller diameter than indicated in the photos.  A perfect match to my existing set.  Actual diameter is a hair under 3⅛""."
"We had an older set of these glasses and over the years, several had been broken.  No other manufacturer makes an exact match, so we had to order the Libbey 918CD model -- really nice glasses, but very expensive -- probably 3 or 4 times what we paid for our older set."
"These glasses actually hold only 10 oz, when filled to the brim.  The description says Libbey's 11 oz."
These glasses are very sturdy and have a nice feel and weight to them.
Great quality. Good size for water or juice. Nice feel in the hand. Great value for the price
"we are down to 2 glasses out of the dozen in a few months. I know they are made of ""glass""  but we have other sets, including wine glasses, that have survived years of clinking in the dishwasher and bumps in the sink. These glasses have a thin rim and almost every one that broke has the same shape piece come off. Many broke just going through a dishwasher cycle."
"The Marquis by Waterford Markham Double Old Fashioned Set is simply exquisite! These glasses are the perfect combination of elegance and functionality. The crystal-clear glass and beautiful cut design make them a stunning addition to any bar or dining table. They have a nice weight to them, giving a luxurious feel when holding them, and the 11 oz capacity is just right for enjoying a generous pour of whiskey, cocktails, or any beverage of choice. The craftsmanship is outstanding, with each glass showcasing Waterford’s signature quality and attention to detail. Whether for everyday use or special occasions, these glasses elevate the drinking experience. They also make a fantastic gift! Highly recommend this set for anyone who appreciates fine glassware."
"These have comfortable feel and weight, great design--downside is if you put them in dishwasher they will discolor--says so on instructions and is true"
"These glasses reflect the light beautifully, are a nice weight, and perfect size. And a great price too. I couldn't be happier."
"The author of the description has been very truthful and meticulous to let you know everything you need to know about these.  You need to read ALL of it.  What I am referring to is that these lovely glasses are not the razor-sharp hand cut Waterford of yesteryear that some of us remember.  These are not hand cut and are not made in Ireland.  They ARE machine cut and come from Italy, but DO feature the Waterford stamp.  They are indeed lovely and are a value version of the very expensive forerunners.  I am very happy with mine -  in fact, they are for a gift and will be lovely.  Just don't be surprised when you go to inspect them & you don't cut your fingers.  A+++. Great value and still happy!"
Nice looking glasses which arrived well packaged and protected. Look and feel like expensive crystal. Machine washable but recommend hand washing to maintain clarity. Ice sounds wonderful in these glasses. Very happy with this purchase.
"Took me several tries to find my definitive whiskey glass - These were the closest for the money. Quite adequate until you compare them to high-end crystal (so don't). Curious to realize the exact design in next level crystal - Enjoying them regardless of my nits.Pros:* Decent weight, neither heavy nor light* Nice refractions, enhance the look of the whiskey* Seem durable, without feeling like plastic* Lip not too thick but not quite thin enough eitherCons:* Cannot unsee the circumference seams at each third."
These look very expensive and they are a fraction of the price of the rest of the Waterford collection. However they are so heavy that they are virtually unbreakable.  Love these!!!
This glassware is used every day for every meal.
Lovely glasses
"Bought two sets, one came broken on each box. Quality is not great. They’re too thick and don’t even look like crystal."
Love the height of the overall glass and the long stemware makes it special.  I did find the glass is a bit heavy in weight so it makes it a bit more like glassware than crystal.
I DID NOT GET AN AUTHENTICITY CERTIFICATE...JESUINHO
good quality
Like the cut of these. Very unusual.
"I like that these ribbed glasses are stackable. I can stack them (no more than one on top of the other) and make more room in cabinets for other glassware. They are lightweight and sort of thin and not as thick as I had hoped. The clarity is okay, it is not bad, but it is not pristine either. Finally, the main highlights are that these stackable highball glasses have that popular ribbed design and are affordably priced."
"I recently received this set of ""Ribbed Drinking Glasses set of 6, 14oz Vintage Glass Cups,Elegant Ribbed Glassware,Highball Glasses,Clear Glass Tumbler,Cocktail Glasses,Iced Coffee Cup for Water, Beer,Juice,Mojito,Decor,Gift"" to accompany a similarly styled set of ribbed tumblers.This set came very well packaged in a box with double foam protection with cutouts for both the tops of the cups as well as the narrower bases.  No signs of damage and I have to say that I appreciate the extra steps.  On top of that, despite the box being somewhat plain, it was still nice enough that this set would be a great gift idea (think: Housewarming Present).These glasses aren't huge, being only 14oz., but they're big enough for general daily use.  A canned soda (or beer) is typically 12oz., and that extra 2oz. should be enough for a couple of ice cubes.  Also, because they're made of boroscilicate glass, they can be popped in the freezer for those times when ""a frosty one"" is called for without fear of the glass breaking.  ;-)This set of six ribbed drinking glasses is priced at $34.99 as I type this review, but is also marked down 29%, lowering the price to $24.99.  But wait!  There's more!  There's an additional 20% coupon right now, which then lowers the price another $5.00, putting this half-dozen glasses at $19.99.  Hard to knock promo pricing like that, honestly, and that makes me even happier to recommend these glasses to others."
"I’m really digging these ribbed drinking glasses* They have such a cool, ultra-modern look that instantly elevates my kitchen. The ribbed texture gives them a unique feel, and the shape is sleek and a bit different from your usual glass, which makes them stand out. They’re also the perfect size for pretty much any drink, and I love how sturdy they feel in hand without being too thick/heavy. Definitely a stylish addition to my barware collection. If you’re looking for glasses that are both functional and stylish, these are a great pick!"
These ribbed glasses are nice. I’ve used them for iced coffee and they feel sturdy without being too heavy. The vintage design adds a nice touch to my table setup. They’re easy to clean and have held up well after several uses.
"These glasses are cute but very very thin and light.They don’t feel hefty in your hands and the drinking experience is not as pleasant.They are supposed to be stackable but because it’s so thin, I fear that they will break if they get stuck to each other.  I’m not crazy about these."
"I have three kids and we go through glasses pretty quickly whether it’s durability or they get fogged up in the dishwasher or lost or dropped or whatever. I thought these were super cute so I snagged a box of them. I do love how they look. My only concern is that the glass is pretty thin and lightweight and I’m fairly certain they’re gonna get broken easily in our house. The transition from sink to dishwasher when you have kids is a little dangerous for glassware, and since my kids do the dishes, I am a little concerned about the durability of these glasses. Time will tell and I will update my review. Other than that, they are great! They look super cute. They are uniform size and shape, and the clearness of the glasses is good. I just worry that they are a little thin and lightweight for a household with kids."
"This is a very attractive set of six vintage style ribbed 14 ounce drinking glasses.  Perfect for dinner guests, casual affairs, or for everyday use.  The glass is thick and durable, a blast from the past in regards to style, perfect for gifts or setting up home for the first time, always a welcomed addition to your glass collection to select from for serving the perfect drink from the correct type of glass."
"First I wanted to thank the company, Zulay Kitchen, for the care they did to pack EACH glass in bubble wrap and NOT putting adhesive stickers right on the glass, which is so hard to get off!  The glass looks beautiful, has a sturdy bottom and is dishwasher safe.I highly recommend them !!!"
"They are a lot bigger than I thought they would be. I love the color, and seem nice and sturdy. They do stack, but they kinda get stuck on each other, and stacking them makes them really tall. So you are better off just not stacking them. I am happy with the plastic glasses!"
"These are holding up well with daily use.  They do break easily if dropped on the floor by kids.  Otherwise, Iâ€™ve gotten a lot of compliments on them."
Good quality. Perfect on our boat as donâ€™t have to worry about glass breaking. Wash well
"L9ve these. They are so pretty & look like glass. Nice & thin, comfortable to hold. Perfect size"
"Lightweight, clear, good quality."
My husband thought it was real glass. You pick them up they are very lite weight. They look like real glass and high end. Package very well to no broken ones.
"I bought these cups last year, and when they were new they looked great! However over time they are getting scratched, certain things stick to them/they donâ€™t always come clean from the dishwasher. I wish they had held up a little better."
"Like the look of them, in fact we ordered a second set and use them for everyday. Nice sizes."
"Started using these glasses immediately after delivery.  Set them up in my Airbnb apartment, and they are perfect.  Sturdy, holds a lot of volume, and overall has a great, high quality feel.  Excellent value for the price.  Would buy again in the future."
"Glad we ordered these glasses, they have a nice quality and size to them.  They look nice and feel good in the hand."
Wish I had ordered these sooner. The glass is not thin and cheap. Dishwasher safe. Sturdy but not heavy. Arrived perfectly. No flaws.
Bought these to etch some design into them for coaches gifts. They are very simple and nice looking. Good quality.
Outstanding for the price. Clear glass. No problem in the dishwasher.
"These glasses are great! They are nice and heavy, not chintzy or cheap. They look lovely, and I appreciate the great quality."
"This have been great for our family. They are a wonderful size, and they are a classic drinking glass. Very practical!We had glasses before that would never come clean in the dishwasher, and ain‚Äôt nobody for time for that! Bought these hoping they would wash up better in the dishwasher, and they do! They usually come out sparkling clean, occasionally with some smudges still, but I honestly think those outliers are due to poor placement in the dishwasher. Super helpful to have daughter help me do the dishes! Sometimes they don‚Äôt put them in the washer where I would though. It‚Äôs a give and take‚Ä¶ parents know what I mean.So, gave it 4 stars because these are nice, classic, basic glasses and because they come clean way more easily than my last set of glasses. Why not 5 stars? They are just basic. Nothing to make them pretty, stylish, or outside or the ordinary. Craftsmanship is nice though, they arrived on time, they arrived in perfect condition and I highly recommend them!"
Very nice drinking glasses to add to my collection
