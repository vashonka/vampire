"I got the best sleep in my traveling career by using this pillow. Paired with a blackout mask and noise cancelling headphones, I was able to sleep for 7 of a 9 hour flight.The thickness is perfect, as you can adjust the pillow around your neck so that the thickness is where you choose- the design of it is super friendly for all types of sleeping arrangements for your head to rest comfortably.It supported my head and neck well, woke up feeling great, with no pain or soreness.I did wake up sweating, but that‚Äôs likely because I had a single sliver of an opening (of my own doing) to breath through as I slept . I don‚Äôt think it had anything to do with the pillow.Will definitely be purchasing again for my fiancee and if I misplace my current one!"
"I was on a 9 hr flight. After a while it did get uncomfortably warm and it is bulky to carry when not in use, but it was nice and soft. Good support."
"I have tried so many different pillows in my quest to find one that helps keep my chin from dropping to my chest when I sleep. This is the only one I have found that keeps my neck propped all night, while also beingcomfortable to sleep on. I agree with others that it is not super compact for traveling, but it comes with a travel bag, so it will be coming with me wherever I go. (I also bought a 2nd one as backup.)"
This is the best neck pillow I‚Äôve found so far. It‚Äôs super soft and I love that you can mold it to how you want it. The one negative for me is it doesn‚Äôt really hold your neck up. Still 4 stars though!
"Very comfortable and flexible to make that just-right snuggle fit to agree with just how you and the seat are getting along and if you have a window seat or have to drop down on your table or fortunately can actually get a seat that leans back a bit.  Yes airlines are made for alien's that weight 60 pounds and have short legs, not normal humans - but this neck pillow arrangement really helped me.  Now it is a larger kind of bag to carry but you can work it into attaching it to your carry on luggage.  Well worth the effort....."
Enjoyed having this neck pillow with me on the plane. I was not as restless. Slept upright comfortably.  Other accessories were a bonus to the purchase which I have not used as yet.
Spot on for job great price
"Even though this is made by Tempur-Pedic, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this pillow to be THIS good! It has the classic ‚ÄúTempur-Pedic‚Äù feel, which I would rate it as a medium firm, and the zip off navy blue cover has a soft, velvety feel, so it looks more high end than typical orthopedic pillows. I think this would be helpful to use between the knees, or as a lumbar support, but I‚Äôm using this as a cervical support, so my review is focused on this purpose.For reference, I have cervical disc degeneration (spondylitis and stenosis, with herniated discs and bone spurs pressing on peripheral nerves), and have suffered from chronic Trigeminal Neuralgia (often referred to as the ‚Äúsuicide headache‚Äù because of its intensity), migraines, and radiculopathy pain/tingling/numbness in hands and arms, as a result of my cervical issues. I‚Äôm disabled and in constant pain, and cannot hold my head upright for more than 20-30 minutes without the nerve pain becoming much more intense. I have to wear a neck brace if I‚Äôm driving, prepping meals or folding laundry, etc. So, using right pillow has been critical for my health and well-being.My old memory foam neck pillow (not sure of the brand) had finally lost its ability to hold shape after 15 or so years. I have a Tempur-Pedic adjustable bed, and absolutely love how it feels, so that‚Äôs was willing to give this one a try. And even though other memory foam pillows were less expensive, from my experience, memory foam isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits all product‚Äî it can be softer, or firmer, depending on the type or the manufacturer, and some kinds of foam have terrible off-gassing odors, or tend to flatten after a short time. This is the 11th or 12th memory foam pillow I‚Äôve purchased in the last 20 years to help with my neck, so I figured this time, I‚Äôd  rather spend a little more on a Tempur-Pedic brand product, and ‚Äúbuy it once, buy it right.‚ÄùThis is definitely the ‚Äúgoooooood‚Äù kind of memory foam! It‚Äôs incredibly supportive, but still soft to the touch. And for those who say it‚Äôs too firm or too hard‚Äî I suggest that when you receive a memory foam product in the mail, you should always allow several hours for the item to acclimate to the temperature of the room (or in this case, perhaps you could try sitting on it for 20-30 minutes) before deciding that the product is too firm. And give the pillow a chance to adjust to the warmth of your body, as well. Temperature makes a huge difference!Since I ordered this in the winter, after initially opening the package, the pillow did feel quite firm (almost as firm as a tennis ball), but within an hour or so, it felt perfect! I was able to sleep all night long with just this pillow providing cervical support (for reference, I am a 5‚Äô8‚Äù average sized woman), without even using my regular contoured (not Tempur-Pedic)  memory foam pillow. It was heaven! I‚Äôve never been able to sleep at night just using a cervical pillow, so I‚Äôm blown away!The peanut shape allows for so much flexibility of use‚Äî I can nest my neck in the ‚Äúdip‚Äù of the center, or can shift it so that the larger end of the pillow presses against the base of my skull, which feels incredible! It‚Äôs comfortable in both a supine and side lying positions, and since I‚Äôll be using it while sleeping on my side, I decided to tuck it into a pillowcase during nighttime use, just so I won‚Äôt need to worry about removing zip off cover to wash it quite as often. While reclining and reading in bed, I can pair it with my regular memory foam pillow, so it‚Äôs nice to have something that provides this much support and flexibility of use. Since receiving it, I have been using it while relaxing on the couch, while in bed, everywhere I can! I wish I just could walk around with it all day long- it feels THAT good! I‚Äôll update my review if anything changes, or if the pillow doesn‚Äôt seem to hold up over time.I paid full price for this product, and have not received any compensation or other consideration for this review. I find reviews to be incredibly helpful to me when our items online, so that‚Äôs why I like to take a moment to write reviews for products I purchase. I hope you have found this review to be helpful!TL;DR‚Äî This pillow provides the PERFECT support, the zip off cover is luxurious and washable, and the hanging loop will be handy for travel. It‚Äôs a Tempur-Pedic, so you can‚Äôt go wrong!"
"If you have neck problems and benefit from relaxed neck traction at night, this is great. I use a firm foam pillow with two humps normally, but for traveling, this does the job. It's about a foot long, does NOT feel like a brick (you can easily squeeze it with your non dominant hand). It's perfect! Firm, ergonomic, portable. Great for portable chronic neck pain relief."
"This peanut pillow is perfect in every way! It is just the right size, not too big, not too small. It provides exactly the right amount of support for my neck. The cover is soft and comfortable on my skin. I bought it to use at the dentist as the chair hurts my neck but I use it every day at home too. It is a little expensive but is well made and worth every penny that I paid for it. I love this little pillow!"
"Had it for about 3 months now and my wife and I both use it all the time. Me for my neck and her for her back. On the couch and in the car. Still in great shape and a great balance between squishy and firm, even after all this use. Did need a small break in period at first where it was a little stiff."
I ordered the Tempur-pedic pillow to support my lower back on chairs and in my vehicle. It works well at preventing back pain as it's very supportive but not at all stiff like others I've used in the past. Soft cover with a velvety feel is a bonus
"It seems really well made & perfect for travel, but it was just too big around for my neck. I'm a slight-framed woman, 5'5"". Wish it came in a smaller diameter."
"love this P pillow! also, discovered that I prefer using it without the blue suede covering which compresses the memory foam a bit which makes it feel a bit harder and less comfortable. So I place only the foam portion into a pillow case (to keep it clean) and then use it and it feels so muck more comfortable, like a caress! try it f it feels a bit too hard."
"I‚Äôm making an exception in the case of this product!It‚Äôs excellent! It hits a home run in all the categories listed and let me just add, it‚Äôs not to firm!  It‚Äôs absolute perfection in that category as well! If you are thinking about buying something to use as neck support while sitting in your recliner watching TV and relaxing, look no further!  This is it! It‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for!I thought awhile before pulling the trigger on this purchase, because it‚Äôs a little pricey‚Ä¶. Then I thought‚Ä¶. You know what, if the reviews are even close to what they say about this product‚Ä¶. So, I bought one. It was delivered on time ( same day ) no delays no problems . It was packaged professionally, you could tell it was new and fresh because it smelled clean, looked clean and came in a zippered container that kept it that way for the customer. If I had a little money, and could invest in the company that owns this product, I would not hesitate to buy stock. The product is that good!  I‚Äôve had the product less than 24 hours, but used it the entire time for my neck support in my recliner. I haven‚Äôt, nor can I sleep in a traditional bed, I‚Äôm handicapped due to a car wreck which has prevented me from sleeping flat on my back for many years now. I have to have an adjustable incline in order to sleep, a recliner has been my bed for 40+ years now and I have tried countless other pillows, to no avail. This one is THE CORRECT PILLOW!  Buy it! I guarantee you will find it perfect! I‚Äôm just a citizen of the USA, I paid $40.00 for this product, just like you will if you decide to try one. I‚Äôm not affiliated with the company nor have I been compensated for this review."
"All Purpose Tempur-Pedic Pillow - Peanut Shape, size, small. It supports the neck really well. I‚Äôve used while sittting in a chair, sleeping in bed and for me it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôll be testing it on a road trip and an air flight, keep you posted. I do own other Tempur Pedic pillows and they do take some time for you body to adjust and when it does you‚Äôll never use another brand of pillow."
"Love the shape and how huggable it is!It is so easy to pack and bring it in short trips, or even as a lumbar support in road trips!"
"*This is a HONEST review from a real buyer! I read reviews about everything before purchasing and I often feel mislead.. I hope that my review can help someone else who may be having the same issues or sleep in the same strange position as I do*After suffering a neck and shoulder injury in early January I've spent the whole year and a ton of money searching for and testing anything and everything to provide even the slightest bit of relief. Finally my search has ended thanks to this pillow!I am an avid side sleeper and although medium to hard pillows are recommended, my whole life I have gotten away with the big soft fluffy pillows with no problems at all, that is until my injury. On my 2022 pillow hunt journey I've tried pillows made of all different things, shapes and sizes and each one seemed to be worse than the last and almost all of them (although the claim to be medium) are so hard I swear you can knock someone out with it.The Sidney pillow was one of the first to go in my cart but I kept putting it off due to some of bad reviews I read (particularly the chemical burn ones) and ended up going for more expensive pillows.HUGE MISTAKE!Finally I was in such extreme pain, sleep deprived, desperate and seen this pillow could arrive that night so ordered it and ordered 2 other kinds of pillows as well just incase.. Sidney pillow showed up around 4 am I immediately took it out of the package threw my own pillow case over it and tried laying on it right away before it fully expanded. There was a slight smell but I didn't care I had no patience and I just wanted sleep. After a few minutes I decided to add more stuffing (because it had not yet expanded fully) and layed back down and FINALLY got some sleep. When I woke up I did remove some of the stuffing and put it back in the bag and left the pillow to lay out with both the cover it comes with and my own off for the remainder of the day and occasionally fluffing it. By bedtime the smell was gone and it took just a little fluffing to get it how I wanted it and then I drifted off to the land of nod.The sidney pillow is what I would consider a ""medium"" pillow. Not so hard you feel like your laying on a rock but not so soft you have no neck support and falling into it. The slight curve in the pillow may not look as though it would make that big of a difference. I personally underestimated the curve lol. Now I can't imagine using a pillow without that curve. Ive tried many contour pillows but they are always so hard and they dont properly support the curve of my neck as they are to high and seem to be more for back sleepers. I never sleep with my pillow laying horizontally..  I like to sleep on my right side with my right arm upwards and underneath my pillow and kinda hug it. Normally this makes me need two pillows one to hug and another to lay my head on but that needs constant adjustment as I move or there are L or J shapped pillows but those do not provide enough pillow to hug on the longer leg side of it plus they take up a lot of space in bed.  So if you sleep like me, the curve with the Sidney Pillow allows you to perfectly form around it and the pointed corner ends wraps under your neck and head and around your shoulder giving the extra support normal rectangular pillows do not.After the first time sleeping on it I already felt less neck pain when waking up. After 3 days zero neck pain or shoulder pain upon waking up. Of course as the day goes on depending what I'm doing the pain starts to creep back up on me but with the help of this pillow I'm easily and comfortably able to get to sleep each night.  No more tossing and turning all night, no smell after airing the pillow out and allowing it to expand properly and no chemical burn which was my biggest fear cause I have super sensitive skin. I do not feel the cubes of stuffing as others said through the pillow case when I lay on it or even by running my hand over it. The cubes are very tiny and in no way jabbing at your face lol. It does take a little fluffing at first but I have not needed to constantly fluff it or had issues with it losing its shape. In fact the longer I've used it the better it has gotten as it has molded perfectly to me and my bodies natural curves and where I need the support.I know going off others reviews is difficult when it comes to pillows because everyone is different and sleeps differently but I truly think this pillow could be the one for just about anyone as it's easily adjustable to your liking of firmness and it molds to you and your body and sleeping position rather than the permanent pre cut and shaped you see with other pillows.I definitely recommend this pillow just be sure to remove the pillow case it comes with and allow it to air out and occasionally fluffing it during this process to release the fumes and help it expand properly. You may want to play around with the amount of stuffing you want in it to find what is best for you but don't lose patience if the first night it's not perfect because the more you sleep on it the more it will form to you and your curves. It truly becomes a pillow that seems as if it was molded just for you. I also don't recommend using it as a pillow you lean against in bed when sitting up reading or watching tv because that will change the form it has built for your individual neck, head, and shoulders."
"My husband bought this pillow recently because he’s a side sleeper and always wakes up with a sore neck with the regular pillows we’ve had. He figured he would try this one out. Since he’s been using it his neck doesn’t hurt when he wakes up!! He was telling me how comfortable it is and how it’s helped so much with his neck pain. So i thought I’d try it out as I’m a side sleeper as well, with back issues. I took a long nap with it and discovered that it’s the most comfortable pillow I’ve ever slept on. I immediately purchased one for myself and I’ve been sleeping great ever since!! My sleep is so much better with this pillow. Regular pillows would kind of go flat in the middle where my head rests and the sides be puffier. I would toss and turn. Now i sleep so much better and I’m not waking up as much. The pillows come with a very soft outer case and they even include a bag of extra stuffing! The pillows maintain a comfortable temperature.  I would rate this 10 stars if i could!! The best $32 I’ve ever spent!!"
"This is a queen size pillow and requires a queen size case; a normal case will not fit. This pillow has no smell whatsoever. The extra filling is nice but not needed. You will need to take filling out. I took out what seemed like gallons of filler and the pillow is still super puffy and hard to sleep on. This is a great pillow to prop your head on to watch TV but sleeping on it so far for me hasn't been enjoyable. The texture of the pillow is fine, the pillow is just too thick no matter how much filler I take out of it."
"Due to multiple cervical spine surgeries and cpap, it’s been difficult to find a pillow for my needs. This pillow fits the bill!  It is both supportive and comfortable, allowing me much more restful sleep every night. It is an ideal pillow for us special needs folks and I’m so happy to give it a thumbs up!"
The firmness of the pillow is a bit off. Yes you can adjust by adding more foam which is provided or remove foam. The problem though is the foam naturally gets pushed to the back of the pillow and stops supporting the neck. Now I can add more foam but now I have a pillow that’s to big and poofy. As I move around it doesn’t adjust well and I just wake up with a stiff neck.If you want a super soft pillow poofy pillow then you’re golden.How I fixed my problem:I have a foam filled body pillow that has firm foam cubes as filling. I had a bunch of extra that I saved in a bag from when I removed some from it to suit my needs.I mixed the super soft foam with the firm foam about 30:70 with the majority firm and I had a great night sleep. I didn’t want to give up on the pillow cause it is really nice shape and materials. If this pillow had come with firmer foam or an extra foam that was more firm I’d be giving this a 5 star review.
"I've spent so time researching pillows I needed something that wouldn't leave me stiff,  sore with a headache in the morning. I spent a bunch of money trying different ones out. Then I found this pillow. The shape was a bit off putting. But I'm so glad I gave this one a try Like others have said in their reviews, there was an order at first. I washed the cover with my favorite softener and aired the pillow out for 24 hours before using it.  I love that it comes with a bag of extra stuffing and another bag for excess stuffing. The first few nights I didn't add or remove any stuffing and it was pretty comfy. But the 4th night I removed a bit of the stuffing and it was heaven.  I haven't had any more morning headaches, stiffness or soreness  I recommend this pillow for people with neck problems."
To anyone who gets a sore neck this is the perfect pillow to solve that problem. It's perfect but very expensive!
"I was having pretty severe neck and shoulder pain, this pillow helped alleviate the pain considerably, its not all gone but definitely a big help!I like that you have the abiility to adjust the filling as needed. My head and neck are supported very well by this pillow."
But sadly it didn’t work for me
It was a big treat to invest in a pillow I was a bit doubtful it would help me sleep but it's worth investing in from my perspectiveIt takes a little while to have the right volum of memory foam for you personally but once you find the right amount it's great. It's slightly strange having a pillow this shape and it's easy not to put your head properly on it so resting the crown rather than whole side of head but you'll know because your just nit as comfy as you should be so pull it down securely under your head and although you know your heads on something but alchmy happens as once your resting on it youve not much time to think because your fast asleep which for insomniac me is great.You don't need to search for the right shape pillow case as I did but use a regular pillowcase it doesn't detract from the pillowYou get a nice back with lots of extra memory foam so you'll be able to use as much or as little as suits you bestI found using a bit more than I expected to need was best for meI would recommend this pillow
"As an chronic insomniac with apnea  as well, I sleep in a chair -- choking is, one might say, ""not fun.""  Suffice to say, I've tried may such neck pillows and this one beats the all the rest for ease of use and comfort.Unlike the others, this one retains it's fluff best, the pillow can be removed to clean the carrier."
"Perfect size and softness, very comfortable.  I love the fact that you can use it straight or curved unlike other brands.  Very happy with this."
"I have tried several other neck pillow which ended up hurting the back of my neck because they were too hard and not adjustable. This one is adjustable and I just love it for using on my recliner at night to watch TV. I would highly recommend it! (UPDATE): After using this neck pillow for a few months, I still like it but it has flattened out quite a bit and now It is not as supportive as when it was new. I wish I could get some replacement microbeads to add to it. Otherwise I still like it."
I have 3 fused cervical vertebrae and this pillow is a real game changer for travel and positioning.  The microbes are easy to move to either flatten out or plump up and area for maximal neck comfort allowing both side lying and supine sleeping.  The pillow also is flexible enough to wrap around your neck for support in travel either while riding in a car or in flight.  Great pillow for the money
"bought this in anticipation of long plane flights when I'd be falling asleep. Found that pillow just pushed my neck forward into an awkward position. Nicely made,  but not good for me."
"I bought a memory foam, straight cylinder-style, neck pillow (with the bamboo cover), and it was just too firm. While laying on my back in bed with it under my neck, it jutted my neck out too far and my head back. I'd use it for maybe 20 minutes a night, and my neck pain got noticeably worse after 2 weeks. This microbead is much better. It's much looser/floppier, and you can push the beads to be more dense or less dense under your neck as feels comfortable. And the longer length and very long strap on this one allows you use it in loose or tight U-shape if you want. I found a medium U-shape also gave my head some side-to-side support while I was using it. Plus this microbead gave a nice warming feel. I'm not a back sleeper at all, and I actually found myself dozing off a little with this one. I highly recommend this microbead over any memory foam for neck while lying down on back."
"I thought Samsonite was a reliable manufacturer, but I've changed my mind based on this product.  It preformed as expected for about three months, then the filler began migrating within the ever-expanding fabrics they used.  I've removed the outer cover, tried to gauge how much fabric would return the product to it's original support, and tied a knot in it to limit the size, but no go.  The fabric keeps expanding, and I have to keep retying the knot.What's up with your quality, Samsonite?  Whichever department chose, then tested? this product either failed and lied to you, or, you accepted not one, but two fabrics that are dysfunctional for the item (both inner and outer covers over-stretch).I'll not trust the Samsonite name again (no matter the price), because this product should never have left your production building with your company name on it.Fool me once..."
Adjustable as its long and squishy not molded into a ring. I have a lot of arthritis in my neck and this works well for neck support without pushing my neck forward out of alignment. Removable cover is important to me for washing. I would air dry it though.
"I've had a couple of neck pillows in the past (mainly to use when flying) and found that they were too big/uncomfortable for me. I'm small in stature (4'10"") so the thickness of many neck pillows are just too big and I wind up with a sore neck when I get home. Took this one recently on a couple of 5-hr flights, and it was perfect. This one is very malleable, you can adjust the pillow's thickness the way you want to suit your needs. And the clip on the pillow makes it easy to tote as well...I attached mine to my purse straps so I wouldn't have to physically carry it through the airport. Very comfortable, a great purchase!(Only drawback I had with it....when I finally arrived home and put my purse on the living room floor, my over-excitable border collie spotted the pillow - still attached to purse - and thought he'd lucked out with a new stuffy toy, purchased just for him, and he began attempting to pry it loose. I had to persuade my semi-spoiled companion that no, the neck pillow was not for him. But for the few moments he had it, he loved it.)"
"This is the best neck pillow for stuffing with your extra clothes for traveling with carry on, it's a strong zick, sturdy but soft fabric and still super comfy to sleep on, plus filled with clothes it's basically a weighted pillow, buy, you won't regret!"
The item is soft and flexible. Very comfortable fit around the neck. Great buy!
The pillow is a snug fit and with Velcro’s to adjust can be flexible.
"Well, I'm a hard worker. I often get lost in my creative zone in the study and stay seated for hours. Soon, my neck and shoulders “protest”.My wife always tells me to take a break and nap on the desk when I'm tired.😜This grey, oval-shaped travel pillow stuffed with memory foam came along at the right time. I gave it a shot, and it was surprisingly comfy! Whenever I hit a writing snag and my neck felt as stiff as a board, I'd simply lean back on it.😁It provided just the right support for my neck, with a great bounce-back quality. The velcro was a nifty addition, making it super easy to adjust the tightness so it fit snugly around my neck.😳I didn't limit its use to the study either. There were times when I was half-lying on the lazy sofa in the living room, using it too.Sure, when I woke up, my neck felt a bit strange at first, but there was no denying it was way softer than those U-shaped pillows.It was ideal for leaning over the desk and grabbing a short nap during breaks. Over time, it's truly become my trusty sidekick on workdays, always there to make those long hours of work a bit more bearable."
"I ordered this neck travel pillow from Amazon Vine because to take with me when I travel to see if it could make me feel a little bit more comfortable when I am flying. From the moment I unrolled it from its compact travel bag, I could tell it was designed to be practical and easy to use. The memory foam inside felt just the right amount of firm and soft, and it bounced back into shape after I squeezed it, which made me feel like it would hold up well during the flight.When I actually used it on the plane, it gave my neck more support than the usual U-shaped pillows I have tried in the past. I really liked that my head didn’t fall forward, and I wasn’t shifting around as much to find a good position to rest. It felt snug, but not too tight, and it has a breathable fabric that kept me from feeling too hot or uncomfortable, even when I wore it for a while.Plus, the cover is removable and washable so I can keep my neck pillow clean after traveling and using it for several hours. Another thing I appreciated was how easily it rolled back up and fit into the small bag, so it didn’t take up much room in my carry-on. It is simple and effective, and it made my journey more bearable without being bulky or difficult to pack away. Therefore, I am quite happy with this neck travel pillow."
"Great neck support if you don't have anywhere to lean to fall asleep. I wish I'd had it for the last 3 long flights prior. I will use it even in a window seat. In the car as a passenger. I have fibromyalgia, and suffer chronic neck and back pain 24/7, so this product is an absolute godsend. I might be giving them for Christmas gifts this year, as I lent it to my son and his girlfriend to take on their flight to Hawaii, and they both said it was amazing. It also comes with its own little carrying case that is small enough to fit in your carry on or backpack."
"This travel pillow is my absolute travel piece!  I was on a 32-hour flight and brought this pillow, which saved my neck!  This pillow is comfortable, and cozy,  and provides good support on long flights.  This 100% pure Memory foam is made to fit around my neck and head, providing me a 360-degree support to keep my neck relaxed without feeling so stiff or tense..  I especially appreciate its breathability - it doesn't overheat even after a few hours of use.  I recommend it to anyone who travels!"
"I love these small neck pillows because it’s great for when you are traveling or even if you need it on your long waits for appointments or other occasions. It wraps around your neck nicely and tight and prevents your head from falling, It supports your neck from neck pains, and it makes your sleep more comfortable, love it, I have it in my car when I need!"
"I expected to receive this pillow in a big package, however, surprising me, it came in a small bag, really convenient to carry it while traveling. This travel pillow offers exceptional relief for those who suffer from shoulder, back and neck pain, especially during long rides in vehicles or airplanes. Its ergonomic design provides excellent support, significantly reducing shoulder and back pain. The memory foam filling is both comfortable and durable, with adjustable Velcro, molding perfectly to your neck for personalized support. Beyond travel, it’s incredibly comfortable to use at home, whether you're watching TV or sitting at the computer. Its breathable, washable cover keeps it fresh and easy to maintain, making it a reliable companion for comfort and pain relief both at home and on the go."
"I recently used this travel pillow on my trip, and it felt pretty soft and comfortable, providing support all around my neck. It’s compact when stored, taking up very little space, making it perfect for travel. Unlike my previous inflatable memory pillow, there’s no need to inflate or deflate it, which was not easy to use. Plus, it’s machine washable, easy to clean. It really helps alleviate fatigue during my journey."
"I bought this for my dog and she loves it! It is so soft, compact, and comfortable that Iâ€™ve been using it as a couch pillow and my husband is using it to ease pain on his shoulder at night.Nice pillow, nice size"
"These are worth the money. They are fully stuffed, but soft and comfortable.  Very nice product. I like them very much.The directions say they are machine washable and dryable. I have not done that yet."
"Perfect size, soft, and the bonus of per knee vs a bolster pillow is when rolling on my side"
These pillows are the size I was wanting but they are a little too soft and flat.  I was hoping for a little fatter pillow.  I use them to lean on when I sleep for my back.  They work but not as well as I would have liked.
These little pillows met my expectations and then some.  I wanted a small pillow to replace an old one that I had been using for a long time for an extra support while reading in bed.  They are soft and yet have a generous polyester fill.  I washed them before I used them and they washed and dried (in the drier) beautifully. I did use two tennis balls in the drier with them to keep the fill from lumping. They seem to be well made and I am pleased with my purchase.
Perfect size to put behind head while reclining. Nice firmness.
Pillows are kind of flat with no recovery. You have to fluff them up and they go flat again rather quickly.
These worked great and weâ€™re very comfortable. I put two in a pillowcase and it worked out great.
"I love how lightweight and neatly this packs.I am going on an international trip, but I didn't want a lot of extra bulk, so I wanted to get a travel pillow that was inflatable, would be easy to pack in my personal item bag for the plane, and I could stow while moving from terminal to terminal in airports. I also plan to use it while our tour group is traveling from place to place on buses.I love how quickly this inflates and deflates. The inflate/deflate valve has two fittings, which allow for adjusting the ""softness"" of the pillow easily, without entirely deflating the pillow. The plastic inside the fabric seems flimsy, but it has to be thin in order for the pillow to pack so neatly into its credit card-sized carrying case. The fabric on the outside of the pillow is soft, luxurious, and will be comfortable to sleep on.It is pricey, but I think it is well-made and will be perfect for my trip. I'll come back and adjust my review if I have any issues."
"These pack up nicely, super light weight, and nice and comfortable. Adjustable inflation is fantastic, and the pressure valve built into these is very easy to use."
"In preparation for an abroad trip with my mom, I did ALOT of research on neck pillows. I read several reviews and decided to try out the top 4 I found.I tried both versions of BCOZZY and I would probably rank them second best although still not something to get a great night sleep with, let alone the bag that it folds up into is still rather bulky.I also tried the Sea to Summit Aeros Premium Inflatable Travel Pillow, which wasn’t bad but definitely wasn’t designed to be using in a reclining chair. It probably would’ve worked fine for a sleeping bag though. I ended up ranking it third on my list just because it would move around when I tried to sleep in the recliner with it testing it out.I also tried the TRTL pillow which based upon the reviews and the price I thought would be great…well it wasn’t. You can only sleep with your head leaning one way and if you don’t have the “plastic support” piece in the right position it’s uncomfortable. Needless to say this one got ranked #4 (worst).Now on to this lovely green pillow…First it’s inflatable which means it takes up less space when not in use. Secondly you can inflate and deflate to whatever amount of pressure you want in your pillow to make it extra comfortable for you. It doesn’t matter if you change sleeping from left to right as it still has support on both sides. It also has a lovely snap so that you can keep the front two ends together (definitely recommend using it). My personal tip is to use the pillow with it turned around in case you nod going forward. It still has enough pillow for sleeping left or right when you do this.I originally bought this solely for an abroad trip, but honestly it’s so comfortable that I’ve used it to take naps in the recliner at home as well as car rides. It honestly is worth every penny!"
"I have purchased two of these pillows for every-night use. They work well, and I think they would work well as an airplane neck support on a flight. However, for my every-night use, I have to add air every day. 8 hours after filling to firm pressure, the pillow is mushy once again."
"I was looking to replace an old, standard travel pillow and am so glad I saw the recommendations for this one on Reddit. Not only is this pillow compact (the case is the size of 2 Airpod cases), I was taken aback by how light this is and soft the material is. I was nervous about the inflation process, but it genuinely only takes 3 puffs and it’s full. The strap is definitely needed, to keep the pillow secure, and I saw one reviewer say theirs ripped off: I can see why this may have happened, it’s definitely lighter weight to achieve the overall lightness in the design, but I can’t imagine it’d break unless you’re tugging at it to come unbuttoned. If you simply unbutton, I don’t see this pillow coming apart anytime soon."
"I don't expect miracles from my travel pillow so I'm happy with this one. I like that I can adjust how firm it is. I also find it comfortable in various positions (""frontwards"" or on the side).  It inflates and deflates quickly. I didn't want one more thing to haul around so I love that I can squish this down into a little case and throw it in my carry on. I recommend this product."
"Comfortable, well made, compacts down well. Perhaps a little expensice for what it is but not egregious"
Their products are the best! This was so comfy. You can easy blow it up and adjust the amount of air on it. So small and convenient to carry w you. No moreCarrying a kind that moon shaped pillow!!!
Bought this for long haul flight to Australia-great support to help you sleep in any position.Only criticism is its very hard to do the straps up behind your neck for optimum support hence 4 stars.
"I like the softness,  but it makes a sound sort of like a crunch from a plastic bag. It is virtually identicle to the Eagle Creek Exhale Pillow, but the Eagle Creek one is a lot cheaper. I won't return this, as the Covid crisis is ongoing,  and it really isn't fair to the people of Amazon to return it, but I'm sorry I bought it."
My first sea to summit product. I tried it out at home. It is so comfortable and packable. Looking forward to using it on my trip.
"I’ve probably tried out eight different travel pillows over the years, everything from the beanbag type that is shaped like a doughnut to the thing that looks like a scarf to hold your head up, to traditional travel pillows, and everything in between. And this pillow got it right, it took the best from every different type of pillow and put it into one. It looks exactly like the pictures and performs as expected. Why it’s awesome: first is the obvious, it keeps your head from flopping forward and waking you up because The pillow itself attaches to the headrest of the airplane seat. And because the front of the pillow has a cinch string, which makes it possible to close the pillow completely around your neck and cradles your jaw/chin, it actually keeps your head from flapping forward if you make it tight. But the pillow and the fabric are firm but soft so it’s not uncomfortable when the pillow is tight. I think the height of the pillow is perfect regardless of how short or long a neck you have because the pillow is plush and can accommodate. The pillow cradles your head on all four sides it also keeps your head from tilting to the side too much. There is padding on the back of the pillow, but not too much, so it would be comfortable to use even if you didn’t end up attaching it to a headrest (I used it in bed lol). it comes with a great travel bag that compresses it a bit for easy traveling. I like attaching a carabiner to the bag strap so that I can easily attach it to the outside of my suitcase or backpack. I haven’t tried washing the exterior yet, supposedly it comes off, but one reviewer said that did not end well. TBD on that."

"We're taking an 11 hour transpacific flight later this year, so we're looking for neck pillows that will keep our heads from flopping when sleeping in economy seats.I've been testing it out while sitting in a chaise lounge, trying to simulate an airline seat. The foam is a perfect density: soft but supportive. It seems to be very well made.I like that it has a case that you can compress it into (and that it warns you not to store it compressed for more than a month). It gets warm, but that can be good or bad.The product has a noticeable scent, kind of like a lemony cleaning product. I hope this dissipates or can be eliminated by laundering the cover.The model (person) shown on the product packaging must have a very long neck, because the pillow doesn’t even touch her ears! I'm 5'4"" tall, and the sides of the pillow are so high that they cover the lower half of my ears. That said, maybe the height of the sides will prove to be a positive for me. Some people might find the pressure on their ears or the warmth around their neck uncomfortable.My husband (5'10"") will try it next to see how it feels for him. At the steep price for these pillows, I don't want to buy a second one unless I'm sure."
"I wanted a pillow that would hold my head upright instead of flopping on a recent trip to Europe for the long, long flight across the ocean. This was super simple to use, held my head upright preventing neck pain, and was very comfortable to sleep with. I got one for me and my wife and we both had a really great experience with these. I don't usually leave reviews, but I was impressed with the quality and functionality so much that I feel it warrants the review.Bonus points that the guy in the seat next to me sets up travel for companies that do President's club trips and travels extensively internationally on long flights and he had the same one and gave a big two thumbs up review about it too. Additionally, I saw several clipped to people's backpacks while navigating airports during this trip. These seem to be the real deal and well-loved and used by many!"
Very comfortable and good neck support for long flights. The back is almost square so it rests comfortably against the seat.Only negative is that it doesn’t fold down so it’s a bit bulky in the carry on. Recommend and I would purchase again
