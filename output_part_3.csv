"When changing the ink cartridge for the first time the contact roller came dislodged which prevented me from properly installing the new cartridge.  I contacted Amazon support which was less than useless as my ""return window"" expired two days ago.Do yourself a favour and choose another printer and also buy your electronics through a reputable store.  The multi-billion dollar Amazon company can't help out their loyal Prime members in their times of need."
"Wifi printing didn't work for me but that's fine as long as it prints ,fine by me."
Can‚Äôt give it 5 because I‚Äôve only used it 3 times.I recently bought a bunch of new tech items and most of them were fancy but didn‚Äôt work. I returned them all.This printer actually works! Does what it says!!Shocking right?Yes it comes with a toner cartridge. (don‚Äôt forget to buy paper!)1) You‚Äôll need a driver for your computer:
"This HP printer is a fantastic little machine. It’s small but can do a lot! Prints come out bright and clear, and it’s super fast. The touchscreen is easy to use, and you can connect it to your wireless network. Plus, it can copy and scan too. If you need a printer that can handle it all, this one is a good choice."
"Print, I have been looking at this preserve for a while and it was on sale at Sam's club and it was actually cheaper here. I think it's great quality and it solves a lot of problems from me when I work from home. Quality printing is perfect for presentations."
"This printer arrived with a broken automatic document feeder. I took it apart, reassembled it, and the ADF started working again. Annoying, but fixable if you are comfortable reassembling printer parts. I did notice the scans done via the ADF were sometimes stretched at points, indicating the ATF rollers weren't completely grabbing the paper. Great.Then the firmware wouldn't update. The self test reported the network connection was working, and I could print to the printer via the network, so I knew the network was good. But it wouldn't download the firmware when the printer was connected via ethernet. I had to remove ethernet, switch to Wi-Fi, let the firmware update fail once, before it finally worked the second try on Wi-Fi.Then, the scan to network folder wouldn't work. Frustratingly, there is no error message. The ""scan"" button is just greyed out. Okay, HP gives you a utility in the printer's web interface to verify it can connect to the network folder. This step passes. Scan button is still greyed out. No network scans over ethernet.For kicks, I tried doing a network scan over Wi-Fi. This worked! Maybe this would be alright if the Wi-Fi didn't intermittently reconnect. (the printer boasts that it will automatically reconnect to Wi-Fi. The fact they have to advertise this is suspect... maybe put a better NIC in these printers??)I'm at my wit's end with this printer and I've only had it for 2 hours. A printer shouldn't take this much troubleshooting to get set up. This one is going back to Amazon."
"Amazing product, high quality printing and easy to handle. Once you explore and setup everything, you have an amazing printer that allows you to save money and time. Highly recommended."
"I'm in IT and I have in the past stayed far away from HP, due to the large amount of software needed to install and so many notifications from the printer once installed.  This printer has none of that... I guess HP finally realized these messages were just a nuisance.  The printer was easy to install and setup on our home network.  Followed the instructions on the screen and it was done in a few mins.I only gave 4 out of 5 stars, due to the scan to email function was lacking... SMTP server is needed for this feature to work.  Which you might need a monthly subscription using (Gmail or MailChimp..etc.)  Wish it was built in... but all in all, it's a great printer and worth the money!"
This is a great multi purpose printer scanner and should last a good long time.
"HP Color Laserjet Pro MFP 3301sdw Wireless All-in-One Color Laser Printer.This replaced an older HP Laserjet.  It took about an hour to unbox and set up for a laptop, IPad and 2 I-Phones.  The laptop took the most time."
"I decided to upgrade to laser last year after my inkjet clogged for the 100th time (once per week for 2 years), and I ran out of maintenance tanks, and there were no maintenance tanks to buy!I got an M283cdw, which worked flawlessly for a year, including long spells without use, and decided to get one for my office too.  But sadly that's been upgraded to MFP3301, which appears not to be as good.  The first unit I got had a hard error every night which required restarting.  The second unit scanner doesn't work - the sensor jams half the time, and the scanner app Scan button blinks but does nothing.  Also it claims (via the built-in webserver accessed via the network) not to be connected most of the time.Both units also complained that paper tray 1 is empty - but since it's a manual sheet feed, that's not surprising -- and the out of paper makes my Mac not want to print unless go to the printed and press OK each time.When it does print, it's fast, clean, and nice looking output."
"Purchased this for a client - setup was easy, the product came well-packaged and was very pretty!  Nice color, looked new.  Everything worked flawlessly!I wish the paper slot were larger, but my client doesn't print much at a time, so she was happy with it.  Thank you for a great refurb product!"
"It works like a charm, I mainly use it to scan but when I first started to print it worked well. Right now, the printing is not great. I'll try to see if changing the ink cartridges fixes the issue."
"Received printer, good condition.  Did not set up for a couple of weeks.  When I did , the printing did not function properly.  a Color print came thru with just a few dots of color on the sheet.  A B/W copy came thru blank.  Tried several different sheets.  Took out each ink cartridge, and cleaned them and re-installed.  The color one functioned okay after this.  the black cartridge still did not perform.  Re-cleaned it and did the water soak suggestion as well.  Still no performance.  Ordered a new 67 black cartridge.  Arrived, I istalled and it printed.  SO  MY CONCLUSION IS THAT A DRIED UP 67 CARTRIDGE WAS SEALED AND SHIPPED WITH THE MACHINE.  I HAD MADE A COMMENT BACK TO AMAZON ON THE NOTICE OF ITEM HAVING BEEN DELIVERED AND WAS IT OKAY? .  BUT NEVER HEARD ANYTHING BACK.  I DO NOT FEEL I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO ORDER OR PAY FOR A ""NEW 67 BLACK CARTRIDGE""  TO REPLACE WHAT WAS SHIPPED"
"I bought this printer for basic printing. i used the thing two different times in the span of a year, printing about 15-20 pages total AT MOST (im being very generous here because i don‚Äôt have exact numbers, but im pretty confident the number is closer to 10 pages)i tried to print one more page after a few months and it wouldn‚Äôt print. i couldn‚Äôt print diagnostic pages because neither the black ink nor the color ink would work. i went through the process of cleaning the cartridges with the options the HP app gave me, i even did a ‚Äúdeep cleaning‚Äù feature they offered me after 3 cleanings in a row didn‚Äôt work. i cleaned the cartridges manually as well and nothing worked. the most i could get out of this machine at that point was very VERY faint light blue in the diagnostic pages, and even then it was too light to make out what had been printed on. i gave up and found the only option i truly had through the insurance i had bought (thank god i bought it too cause it had been over a year since i purchased the printer) was to return it and i gladly did.the only good thing about the printer was the scanning feature, which did fairly well for scanning some images i had wanted digital. still the process of having to use the HP app and be connected to my wifi through the entire process was annoying. good riddance fr"
Bought this refurbished printer as a gift and the recipient was pleased with the ease of installation and the results. It has proved to be a worthwhile purchase.
I got a 4150 HP printer that had been refurbished . It was pretty much new looking and worked like a brand new printer and got a good price on it since it was not a brand new printer
"I was in a pickle and needed a printer FAST. During COVID, all of the printers have been limited supply so I felt I would take a chance on this one. First thing I noticed about this printer when I received it was there were NO instructions. You are instructed to download an app (HP Smart) and configure it all from there, however when I tried, the app wouldn't find any WiFi networks (when I knew there were plenty in my apartment building). THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IF YOU HAVE ISSUES SETTING UP:1. Plug in the printer2. Place ink inside and paper in the feeder3. It will print a page (that I have attached in photos just in case) to help you set up4. Hold down the WiFi button AND the cancel button for 3 seconds until the power button flashes5. Move onto the app to continue configuring - it will ""find"" the printer and then allow you to connect to WiFiThey made this printer unnecessarily complicated to set up but once it is up, it works like a charm and you are even able to change the printer's email address. I tried to set this bad boy up on 4 different attempts and had to walk away 3x because it wouldn't connect to WiFi and I got frustrated. Happy with my purchase now, but I was about to throw it out the window for a second there... Anyways, overall, if you are tech-savvy, I would recommend this printer! I just suggest to the manufacturer that it COMES WITH the instruction sheet rather than making you print it prior to setting it up... that was odd."
Always bought ink jets for home use and the printer heads would dry out.  Need something to print reports and such at infrequent intervals so wanted something that would last a long time with little maintenance.After almost a year of ownership this thing still chugs along and the quality of print hasn't dimished due to lack of use.  Same color quality and depth.  Highly recommend this if you want something that lasts long and doesn't require a lot of cost to maintain.I also bought back up cartridges for 150 bucks which is a far cry less than what ink cartridges cost.
"11-10-20202020 sucks, but my printer is doing great. Still prints fast. We probably print like a page a day, sometimes we print 10. So that's like 400 pages maybe over the course of a year. I don't get any paper jams, or have any of the problems I had with all the other printers I've had to deal with. I am tech support, so I deal with my companies broken computers and printers all the time.1-3-2020Two and a half months later I still love it. We are probably nowhere near the 1800 pages or whatever number it was before the cartridges run out of ink supposedly. I have avoided updating the firmware hoping that will not be an issue for us. It works great, why would I want to update firmware? Over the last 20 years I have dealt with so many problems from so many HP printers, and this one just works flawlessly.My only complaint is that if I print a color picture the lines are not as crisp or Sharp. They still look okay. We just get our photo pictures printed somewhere if they are important. I have not tried it with photo paper, and do not intend to. We have mostly used it to print pictures to cut out for my kids projects to stick them to poster boards for presentations, and it was more than satisfactory. We have also used it to print Maps for road trips, it was okay, good enough...Bottom line is printer works great, app to print from phone is awesome. It prints from my network, I have not had issues with one computer printing to it (we have several). I would buy again.I have still not been compensated for this great review but would gladly take handouts!10-15-2019 brand new today.Quick review: IT'S BIG! HUGE! 2-3 time larger than my 10 year old HP. 50 pounds! Setup wasn't hard, but could have been easier. Prints look great, prints fast, using only for minimal household use. Printed easily from my Android phone using brother print and scan app. I didn't get anything for this great review."
"Brother HL-L3270CDW Compact Wireless Digital Color Printer with NFC, Mobile Device and Duplex PrintiAt less than $300 this printer is, in my opinion, a bargin.  This printer is ~40 pounds, but the box arrived with barely any damage via USPS (pleasantly surprized).  Print quality for fonts is sharp.  Print quality for pictures and images may not be as well defined and posibly over saturated (I didn't calibrate).  I printed a artist's rendering of a girl meeting a young deer, in a forest, and the face of the deer was dark and lacked definition.  The whole print was over saturated and didn't look that bad, but wasn't true to the picture I had downloaded from deviant art dot com.  I don't think I am allowed to upload the print due to (c).The toner will likely last years based on the fact that I don't print much, but if it were an inkjet I'd need to buy new ink every few months I wanted to print a form, map, evelope, letter, etc... 'cause the inkjet heads would dryout and clog.Duplex printing is a plus!My previous printer was a Brother Inkjet, and I liked the ease of use, and quality.I recommend this printer if you're not using it for photographs, or to print nice pictures, but why would you use a laser printer for that?!I paid full price for this product and received no compensation for the product nor review."
"Been using this printer for a year and a half now. Overall it's a pretty good printer. For normal print jobs it of course prints fine. The colors align precisely, and produces good full color images. The duplex printing is a nice feature and also works fine. I also frequently print on card stock and envelopes, and this is mostly fine. You have to open the front panel and manual feed one sheet at a time, but it sometimes won't grab correctly, and thinks there's a jam, requiring you to open it and close it to make it think you fixed something before it'll try to print again.One issue is the toner cartridges it comes with. The first printer I ordered was leaving yellow marks on every thing it printed. So I bought another. The second printer was leaving red marks on everything it printed. Thankfully I hadn't returned the first yet, so I just took the functional cartridges from one printer, and put the defective cartridges in the returned one. But having 2 out of 2 orders with bad cartridges is a pretty lousy failure rate.So minus one star for the annoying issues with it thinking its jammed when it isn't, and for the bad cartridges."
"I've been using the Brother HLL3270CDW Wireless Color Printer in my home office for several months, and it has proven to be a valuable asset for my day-to-day printing needs.Setup and Connectivity: Setting up the printer was straightforward. The wireless connectivity is a standout feature, allowing me to easily print from multiple devices, including smartphones and tablets, without any hassle. The Brother iPrint&Scan app enhances the ease of use, offering convenient options for printing and scanning.Print Quality: The print quality for both color and black-and-white documents is impressive. The colors are vibrant and consistent, making it suitable for printing graphics and small-scale marketing materials. Text documents are sharp and clear, even with small font sizes.Speed and Efficiency: The print speed is commendable, handling high-volume tasks efficiently. This is a significant advantage for anyone with regular or bulk printing needs. It's not just fast but also relatively quiet compared to other printers I've used.Paper Handling: The paper tray has a good capacity, reducing the need for frequent refills. It handles different paper types and sizes well, which is a plus for a variety of printing tasks.Cost-effectiveness: While the initial cost of the printer is reasonable, the toner cartridges can be a bit pricey. However, the high yield options for toner do offer better long-term value. The printer's energy efficiency also helps in reducing operating costs.Design and Build: The printer has a compact and modern design, fitting well in small office spaces. The build quality is solid, as expected from Brother.Limitations: It's worth noting that it's a single-function printer, so if you need scanning or copying capabilities, you might have to look elsewhere. Also, while the color prints are great for documents and presentations, it might not suffice for professional-quality photo printing.Overall: The Brother HLL3270CDW is a reliable and efficient choice for anyone in need of a color printer for home or small office use. Its ease of use, quality of prints, and speed make it a worthwhile investment, especially if your primary need is document printing."
"I bought this product a few days ago and am very happy with it. Since I use Linux Mint, not every product is suitable. However, this printer works ""out of the box"". There is nothing to install. It just works.In addition, the communication and service were excellent. I am very happy and would like to expressly recommend the product and the company."
I was impressed with how well this printer was packaged when it was shipped to me. This Brother color laser printer works very well for me and it has some features I did not have in color laser printers in the past. I am very pleased with the purchase of this laser color printer.
"I recently purchased the HP OfficeJet 250 - All-in-One Portable Printer and I have to say, it has made my life so much easier. As someone who is always on-the-go, the ability to print from both my phone and laptop has been a game changer.Setting up the printer was a breeze, thanks to its wireless and mobile printing capabilities. This feature allows me to seamlessly print from my phone or laptop without having to connect any cords or wires. Plus, the printer's compact size makes it extremely portable, making it perfect for travel or taking to meetings.The quality of prints is also impressive. The colors are vibrant and the text is crisp, just like any traditional printer. I am able to print documents, photos, and even scan important files all in one device.One of my favorite features of this printer is its long battery life. I can easily print multiple pages without having to worry about constantly charging it. This has saved me so much time and frustration.Overall, I highly recommend the HP OfficeJet 250 - All-in-One Portable Printer for anyone who needs a reliable and convenient printing solution. It truly lives up to its name as ""Print on the Go."" Amazing product!"
I don't typically write reviews but was compelled to with this product. It was very easy to set up and prints great. It's the perfect size. 10/10 would buy again.
"Finally, a printer that has enough going for it to be a worthy successor to the legendary HP Si series printers!  I bought this, based on the reviews, to specifically to be able to mobile print from a variety of devices and after 3 months of use, I can say it functions flawlessly!Pros:* Sturdily built - finally a consumer printer that you don't have to fear breaking the flimsy plastic housing if you touch it!  The housing and all external parts are sturdy enough to stand up to normal transport bumps and thumps.* Works with a variety of devices - be sure to have BOTH Bluetooth and WiFi enabled on your computing device (laptop, cell phone, etc) and it will find the printer with no problem.  I have used it extensively with my iPhone 6 airprint and PC laptop WiFi with no issues.* Battery life is great - I go two weeks on a full charge, printing a few sheets per day, and have plenty of battery left.* Color docs look good - I don't print photos on this machine, but the color charts, graphs, and text are clear and sharp.* Works in a wide variety of environments - I've used this printer in near freezing conditions and it just chugs along without a problem.* Copy feature works great - images are sharp and text is clear.  Note that this machine will scan and fax, as well, but I haven't used these features yet.* The price is reasonable for the features and reliability you get.* Reasonably economical on the ink, contrary to most HP inkjets.Con - typically, the HP brand ink is very expensive.Print speed is rather sedate, not as fast as the fastest ink jets, but it's plenty fast enough for mobile use and its reliability and ease of use makes up the difference.  Other reviewers have said this printer could easily be all you need for a home printer, as well as traveling, and I agree.  If you only print occasionally, this machine will meet your needs.After years of being disappointed (disgusted, really) by flimsy, finicky inkjet printers that didn't seem to live much beyond their first set of ink cartridges, I'm sold on this machine.  Hopefully HP will continue this trend (and reclaim their soiled legacy) by extending this effort to their other product lines.Note - if you only need to print is B&W, then check out the OfficeJet 200, which is about 20% cheaper at this writing."
"I love this printer. I 1st bought it to print shipping labels and an occasional bill,  however I have come to love it,  and kept it for use in my small office. We do have a bigger printer in the reception office I can print to if I have a very large print job.  I have used it in the car and in the hotel, but mostly it stays in my small office. It is very convenient and can be easily moved to another room if doing a something that requires printing somewhere besides office. If you need a small printer at your house for occasional printing or school work, but don't want they eyesore of a big printer,  this is for you! It can even be stored in a drawer or cupboard,  and taken out for use, then stored againPros:1.Very small - fits nicely in my small office.  (I bought an insulated 9X13 cake pan carrier to put it in when traveling)2.Can print from phone as well as computer3.Battery if no electricity available4.Good print quality5.Fairly fast - not as quick as our main office printer,  but definately faster than other printers I've had6. Quiet7. Can make copies8. Prints 2-sided (extra step required)Cons:1. Nothing to catch papers after they print (this is the ONLY thing about the design that I really wish was changed.2. Occassionally my phone thinks the printer isn't available when indeed it is.I have never used the scan feature,  so I cannot comment on that."
Nice and compact .quite heavy for its size but does everything I need it to do .easy to set up and use .very happy and would definitely recommend
"We live in a small condo, so can’t have a larger printer just taking up space. This small printer is solidly built, meant to be stowed to be on the road (I sprung for a carrying case - it cost just over a hundred, but also really well made), and it works really well in such small living quarters. Just printed up everything I needed for my corporate taxes, and everything printed up really well! A couple weeks ago I scanned in a tax document, got it sent to my email, pdf’d all nice and neat... I’m really enjoying this handy thing. I have not printed any photos, but for printing documents and scanning, this has done really well. This printer has only been with us for a month, so I may come back to update, but so far, it’s a great product."
"This camera has exceeded every expectation that I had.  Images are razor sharp, autofocus is amazingly fast, the battery life is beyond anything in my experience, and it is a perfect size for my needs.Having owned Yashicas, Rollei, Lumix, Fujifilm and many others...I would definitely buy a Sony again.  What an amazing camera and the kit lens is sharp, even in low light."
"I'm not a professional photographer, but I wanted a good quality camera to take better pictures without lugging around a bulky DSLR full frame. This camera fit the bill. I chose it over the 6400 because I wanted the IBIS image stabilization and the ability to run with a bigger battery with more capacity. I paired it with a set of Sigma (30mm & 56mm) prime lenses that can get down f1.4. The quality of the image capture is insane! I work for some big name studios and did a fair bit of research before deciding on this camera because I also wanted to use it for video conferencing and streaming as well.Some pro photographers scoff at mirrorless cameras or APS-C format sensors. I get it. If you're doing this for a living, you need full frame. But even as a backup camera, or for vlogging, this camera is on par with anything Cannon puts out. Sony is known for their slog color profiles and I can't wait to try color grading some footage shot with it. I paired it with the Magewell HDMI capture card for video streaming/chatting and it works very well. I have it set to not turn off after 30 minutes so I can video chat for hours without worry of the camera automatically turning off.I won't go into all the possible settings in the camera. There's plenty of videos on YouTube that discuss all the features in detail. All I'll say is if you're doing research and getting into more serious photography, or if you're a pro photographer looking for a run and gun type camera or a backup to save you in a crunch, you could do far worse than this camera, but in the form factor you'd be hard pressed to do better."
"OK, so it ain't cheap but the results are amazing. I have a m43 outfit as well which is ALMOST as good. Almost. When I want quick and accurate AF the a6600 is the champ. Image quality superb. I have a lot of difficulty seeing a difference with full frame images, and when you consider the cost, size and weight of full frame cameras & lenses, the a6600 is a no-brainer.Very pleased with this purchase!!"
"I have been using a Canon G9x, Canon G7x ii, and T3i (mostly with 17-50mm 2.8, 70-250mm, 50mm 1.4).  I used the t3i for pictures of my kids (sports, portraits, etc).  I really needed faster burst shooting and better focus for track meets.  I wanted to stay with Canon (just because that is what I'm familiar with), but I wasn't happy with EF-M options (bodies and lenses).  I didn't want to go full frame (f2.8 lenses $$$).  I decided I wanted to go mirrorless, and I couldn't wait for some rumored Canon APS-C mirrorless.So, I ended up going with A6600 + Tamron 17-70 2.8 + Tamron 70-180mm 2.8 + sigma adapter for 50mm 1.4.  I'm very happy.  The fast burst speed is great.  A bigger buffer would be nice, but not a big deal for me. The focus is everything I was hoping it would be.  I love the eye focus.  I love the subject tracking.  I love that there are so many focus options (area size, position, tracking, flex, etc).I'm also very happy with the size of the 2 lenses.  Some people, complain that the touch screen can't be used for the menu.  That doesn't bother me at all.  I prefer buttons. I don't use the touch screen for menus on my Canon G7X.  I prefer the ergonomics of my T3i.  I miss the front dial, but I'm quickly getting used to the top/rear dials.I first ordered the a6400, but the grip just felt too small for the 70-180 lens, so I didn't use it at all.  I put it right back in the box and ordered the a6600.  I'm much happier with the bigger grip.  I like the bigger battery. The extra custom buttons and the IBIS are a nice bonus."
"I bought this after spending a long time researching different Sony cameras. I used to swear by Canon and have a lot of handheld documentary-style and interview filmmaking under my belt as well as social media content creation. I have filmed using an A7Siii in a studio environment and that was the main alternative to this that I was considering. I also looked at the older a6500 as a slightly cheaper alternative. Here's what sold me: - the flip-up touchscreen; - slightly improved processing and body construction; - better ISO sensitivity.I found a deal (separately) on the Carl Zeiss f/4 16-70mm lens and the image quality is staggering on both photo and video. I do mostly documentary-style interviews, vlogging / informational videos, and webinars. I found a simple converter for less than $100 that makes it simple to use this as a 1080p beautiful webcam.This camera is a joy to use. If you use it for long periods of time (as I do in a studio setting), consider finding a dummy A/C power battery to prevent overheating (a very common Sony issue for any shoots longer than ~45min).Sony's autofocus and color settings are simply the best. It would be nice to have dual SD card slots, but that's really the only thing I miss when I consider the much more expensive a7siii."
Excellent product. Video and photo are both incredible for it
I am using this camera for my tv production. Great image. Love the battery life.
"Happy with the purchase. Easy to use, solid and fancy."
"I'm more pragmatic than many others. I only want a great Low Light performance in a camera, features such as 4K at 60P, 15FPS, film simulations, more battery life are nothing to me.Battery life on A7III is more than I expected, video capabilities also are great.Better than competition in variety of things: 15 dynamic range stops! Amazing low light ISO performance, IBIS, astonishing and fast AF, great variety of glasses, DxOmark calls A7III the Low Light Performer, this sensor is over 1 point above than Z6 and over 10 than EOS R. The dual SD slots are very satisfying.Resume: A7III is the WORLD'S BEST CAMERA UNDER 2K $"
"Still one of the best under $2k cameras you can buy currently. Despite being 3 years old, I love it and it is amazing for low light. It films very well, amazing 4k."
I am sure you've already heard about how great this camera is. Let me tell you how great this vendor was with amazon. They got it to me early and in perfect condition. Great work!
"I went from a Nikon D90 to this camera and am very happy with the improvement in image quality, focusing speed and accuracy, as well as frame rate.  The fact that it takes 4k video is also a huge improvement over the 720 video of the D90.  Being able to work in lower-light environments is why I wanted to go full-frame and having the convenience and small size of mirror-less is definitely the future now."
Truly a superb instrument. Camera has so many excellent features. The included bundle is a great addition.
"I did it. I bought this bad boy. Most of the stuff in the kit you won’t use, but the lens is pretty damn good and the camera is amazing! Taking it to Tokyo tomorrow!"
"I bought it through adroma on amazon. This camera was $1900 the day before and at the day I bought it they increase the price by $300, which made this camera not as great value as before.The image quality is undoubtedly great at its price range. However, the accessories come with the camera are not very good as expected. Especially the SD card reader was already broken when I opened the package. Since I have got an old one that works great, I decided not to return and exchange."
The camera is everything I dreamed of and more. The card reader deaf came in handy sense my laptop wouldn’t read the care without it. The battery has incredible life. I haven’t really used much of the the other stuff.
"The Sony Alpha a6400 is an exceptional camera for both enthusiasts and professionals. Its impressive autofocus system is quick and accurate, ensuring you never miss a moment. The 24.2 MP sensor captures stunning images with vibrant colors and crisp details. The compact design makes it easy to carry, and the 180-degree flip screen is perfect for vlogging. Battery life is solid, allowing for extended shooting sessions. Overall, this camera is a fantastic !have for few years now"
"Wanting to leave my more expensive gear at home for a recent cruise to Alaska I picked up the 6400 with the kit 16-50mm lens. While I’ve heard lots of praise for the 6400 the kit lens is often dismissed, but in my experience it was well above its price point. The image quality was crisp and colorful. I was so impressed that I usually left my bulky expensive lens in my cabin. Equally impressive was the ClearZoom function - absolutely usable up to 1.6x with no discernible quality loss for standard jpeg images.Battery life was also much better than my A7Rii but far short of my Canon cameras. 2 batteries basically lasted for a full day of constant shooting.Even in 2024 this is absolutely a great setup and incredibly compact and lightweight. It’ll be my summer travel camera with zero reservations.For the money it’s an incredible value and from my experience the kit lens is no slouch. Focusing was fast and spot on."
Battery life was not as bad as i have heard in the past. Its pretty decent. It is a little heavy with a lens on it so i got a strap. So worth the money! The quality of the images is top tier!
"Exceptional camera. Menu system not as bad as reviews said. Does not get hot at all after a 2.5hr non-stop video at 1080p using dummy battery. Does get quite warm, in a 72deg room, when recording at 4k, but not hot. Internal mics are mediocre, but added shotgun mic and audio is excellent. This is the water-resistant AL-magnesium version, a step up from a6100; worth added expense for magnesium housing and water resistance for protection on a rainy day. Bought with 19-135 lens, pics are excellent.  Only flaw is why the camera cannot output h.264 video over USB or the WiFi? Instead have to buy a hokey (price gouged) HDMI ""capture"" card; HDMI is already digital. Sony has h.264 compression in the a6400. It is used on videos recorded to the SD card. The new a7 will have h.265 lossless compression; too bad they were not on the ball and did not put this in the a6400.  h.264 compression is several years old!UPDATE: After a year and a half, all I can say is fantastic! I am nearsighted and the red focus assist negates the need to wear glasses or use the viewfinder's built-in diopter adjuster. I use this cam with a Laowa 9mm rectilinear lens (manual focus) for indoor pics, and the articulated screen is great for this. It allows the camera to work like a Hassalblad; holding the camera low to get the angle right (so vertical lines are parallel). One can hold the camera at waist height and tilt the screen up. With the 35-135 kit zoom, the auto-focus is excellent. With the SEL200600G, works great, but the big zoom does use up the battery, so keep a spare. Another wow factor is the digital-zoom-in-while-focusing (C1 button in still pic mode). This allows viewing the image zoomed in to get the focus perfect. Water rest mag case is the way to go too. I never worry about being out in the rain with this camera (but I do make an effort to not let it get wet anyway to be safe). probably have shot several THOUSAND pics and all I can say is ""wish I had this camera thirty years ago"". Thanks Sony!"
"I like that this line of mirrorless cameras is lightweight and is relatively compact compared to a digital DLR. As with many of the newer digital cameras the 6400 shoots beautiful video and I am especially happy with it having a stereo mini input that would allow use of high end microphones.  The camera is light years ahead of the bulky cameras I used to use on commercial field shoots. Aspiring videographers don't know how lucky they are to have tools like this at their disposal at such a low cost. Not only is the video stellar, the stills are too. I love the continuous shooting mode when shooting wildlife.  Sony has a great lineup of lenses to pair with the camera and other lens manufacturers are developing lenses for the Sony E Mount cameras as well."
"Love it. I bought another one when my first one got damaged recently, even though it’s a few years old as of 2024,  lightweight and pretty small but packs a punch.  Easy to learn the functions and buttons. It’s not full frame, of course, but doesn’t have that FF price tag either.  Highly recommend for a first time camera.  Good for experienced too."
"I have a Sony A7RV full frame, with that in mind this camera does the job very well. I shoot portraits, venues and passport photos and this APSC can do all those just fine.Post production workflow is much quicker given there is less megabytes to process (from a 61 megapixel full frame to a 24 megapixel APSC). So it's a dream in that regard.A lot is said about the small size and portability about this camera. I have the Sigma 30mm 1.4 to go with this, and yes, the small size and portability is great.This camera doesn't have all the bells and whistles that my A7RV has, but that's not impeding my work flow by any means.If you're on the fence, just get it. Affordable, compact, great autofocus and actually has a faster burst rate than my A7RV."

Sony is first and foremost a technology company, and they are doing things with the A7 series that are currently unequaled. This camera is unique in the marketplace. As of this writing, there's literally nothing else like it from Sony's direct competitors Nikon, Canon, Panasonic, Olympus, Fuji, & Pentax. If you want a full frame mirrorless cam (and don't want to trade your car for a Leica), you're getting an A7. The only question is which A7.(NOTE: For more detailed photos and video, check out the A7ii review on my website [...]-- also do a search for ""Loloho Photo YouTube"" to find my VIDEO channel with lots of photo great reviews!)The original A7 was named ""camera of the year"" for cramming a 24MP full frame sensor into a compact mirrorless body. How does Sony top it with the A7ii? By improving ergonomics, focus speed, video capabilities, and delivering a groundbreaking IN BODY image stabilization system - the world's first 5-Axis stabilized full frame sensor. This illustrates a couple of admirable characteristics about Sony's imaging division - they listen to customers, and they relentlessly innovate. When Sony updates a camera (which they do often), they deliver significant design changes that translate to real world improvement - not just megapixel boosts.A note about lenses: the lens situation is improving. At the time of this writing, the best native prime lenses for the A7ii are the brilliant Zeiss 55 f1.8 and the Zeiss 35. I've heard the Zeiss 16-35 is outstanding but have not tried it yet. At Photokina Sony announced a number of new E-mount lenses that are expected to hit the market in 2015. I feel the sub-100mm range will soon be pretty well covered, especially once these new lenses hit the market. Of course with an inexpensive adapter, you can use just about any lens you please with an A7, and that's what makes these cameras so wonderful.I bought my A7ii here on Amazon and got it the first day of release. In this review, I'm going to assume you know the basics about the A7 series, and go straight to the pros and cons of the new camera. For more files and video about the camera, check out my site. [...]PROS*In Body Steadyshot - This is the marquee feature and for good reason. Now ALL of your lenses have image stabilization - including those 40-year old Nikkors and Leicas. It's amazing and it works. Of course the stabilization is more helpful with lenses towards the telephoto end of the spectrum. I've tried it with my 105mm and 300mm Nikkor primes with impressive results. With native E-mount lenses that deliver focus distance information, you get full 5-Axis stabilization. If there's no electronic communication with the camera to transmit focus distance (as with older legacy lenses) you get 3-Axis stabilization. Note that for legacy lenses, you'll want to manually specify the focal length to ensure the best results. And yes, Steadyshot works a treat for handheld video too. Shortly after the A7ii hit the market, Sony released a firmware update (version 1.1) that improved the in camera Steadyshot and squashed an annoying bug - if you get an A7ii, MAKE CERTAIN that you are running the latest firmware!*Shutter release - The shutter release has been moved forward on the camera body to a more natural location. It's now right where your finger expects it to be. Alas, it's flat across the top like most DSLRs, so there's no possibility of a cable or soft shutter release.*Better Grip - The new hand grip is thicker and easier for my hand to grasp. The new grip extends about 10mm further from the body. The new grip contributes to the apparent size increase in the A7ii.*Improved Autofocus - Sony is claiming 30% better autofocus performance. While many were hoping for AF as fast as the a6000, unfortunately it's not there yet. But Sony has improved the focusing algorithms to elicit noticeably better performance. I've had good success with facial recognition, eye focus, and object tracking. A7ii autofocus is good; I have no major complaints, but it's not as fast as a DSLR or the a6000 (a camera I also own and enjoy).*Build quality - More magnesium is now used in the camera body, and it's obvious. The camera feels solid and reassuring in the hands, like it's been carved out of metal. Even the buttons and control dials add to the premium feel of the camera.*Video  - The A7ii has several notable video improvements. High quality 50 Mbps XAVC S codec is now included. Built in stabilization is a HUGE help with nonstabilized lenses. Now ALL your fast primes are stabilized for video! And the camera includes a S-LOG picture profile with enhanced dynamic range that's useful for color grading.*Wifi - This is not a new feature, but Sony has done a nice job integrating wifi into the camera. The wifi integration really showcase Sony's prowess as a tech company (Nikon and Canon have badly lagged behind in this department, IMHO). We are already taking this stuff for granted, but it's really kind of incredible to remotely control your camera from your tablet or phone -- with a live image view, no less. If you want to quickly share photos from your full frame camera to social media, it's been made easy for you, no clunky adapters required. Sony needs to do a better job highlighting these features, because they are great.*Alpha menus - Sony has now standardized the Alpha menu system across several different camera bodies. It's a clean, logical user interface that works well. With a little practice, it's remarkably easy to access the features you need quickly. The upshot? You spend less time ""menu diving"" and more time taking photos.*EVF - The A7ii electronic viewfinder is essentially the same as the A7, but it should be noted that it's great. The EVF is what allows Sony to squeeze down the body size of the A7 series. Once you get used to having focus assist and peaking (and the results of your shot) available inside the EVF, you will love it. What once seemed like a drawback of mirrorless cameras is now a huge advantage.*Metal lens mount - The A7ii lens mount is more robust than that of the first gen cameras. No wiggle! Lenses mount nice and tight to the body.*More customizable buttons - There are now four customizable ""C"" buttons to which you can assign your favorite functions, like eye autofocus, focus assist, white balance.*Articulating LCD screen - The articulating LCD screen merits a mention because so many DSLRs still do not include the feature. Once you've shot with an articulating screen, you don;t want to go without one. The LCD screen provides a decent range of motion for high and low angle shots.*Startup time - Startup time of the camera has been improved, which means fewer missed shots.*Matte finish - This is a matter of taste, but I like the matte finish of the A7ii.CONS*Weight - Weight has increased over the original A7 by 146 grams or 5.15 ounces to 599 grams. This is no small increase (a 26% gain over the A7, to be precise). When packing camera gear, every ounce matters. If it gets much heavier, we're losing a key advantage of mirrorless. Yet to be fair, at 599 grams the A7ii is still lighter than the Nikon Df (760g), Canon 6D (760g), Canon 5D Mark III (950g) and Nikon D800 (980g). Of course none of those competing cameras offer in body image stabilization, or many of the other features of the A7ii. So the A7ii remains lighter than the competition while offering a uniquely powerful functionality. If the added weight is a deal killer for you, there's always the original A7. Personally, I decided that the extra features are worth the cost in weight.*Girth- The A7ii body is not quite as svelte as the original A7. Thickness of the body itself has increased by a couple of mm. It seems more pronounced because the new grip extends a good 10mm further than the old. The A7ii is (dare I say it?) a bit chunky. The body has become more like a blend of mirrorless and DSLR. I suspect that the average non-photographer would glance at this camera and assume it is a small DSLR. Note that for some people this minus will actually be a plus. Why? Because the camera handles larger/heavier lenses with better ergonomics.*Small control wheels - This is a nitpick, but the fore and aft control wheels are small and almost flush with the body. A larger size would provide better tactile feel.*No 4k video - Not a major omission to me, but the lack of 4k is a disappointment. I think it would have been easy for Sony to include 4k, but the marketing department must have other plans. If you must have 4k, you want the A7S.*No silent shutter - The shutter noise is improved over the original A7, but it's not the dead silent shutter of the A7S.*Antialiasing filter - The A7ii has a low pass filter. I'd prefer they omit it.*Poor Apps Implementation - The original idea of offering apps is a good one, but unfortunately the PlayMemories apps have been poorly implemented by Sony. The PlayMemories store has a few worthwhile offerings, but as of this writing one of the best (time lapse) isn't compatible with the A7ii. Sony needs to open up the app store to allow outside development to make the most of this functionality. (Imagine how lame iTunes or Android would be if Apple/Google provided all the apps! That's what we're getting now from Sony.) Please, Sony - either do a better job with the PlayMemories app store, or just go ahead and include the app features in our cameras from day one.*Battery charger not included - Battery life is not a strength of these cameras (rated at 350 shots per charge) so you will want extra batteries. If you want an external battery charger, you've got to buy your own. I have several batteries and prefer to charge the extras while still having my camera free to use.*Questionable flash options - There's no onboard flash, and Sony's flash offerings are disappointing. No sync speed higher than 1/250. I don't often do flash photography, but there are times when it is necessary. Personally I would appreciate an onboard bounceable flash like that of the a6000 (the a6000 flash works great in this respect) or even a small fill flash like the X100 series.CONCLUSIONWhether you want an A7ii really boils down to two words : STEADYSHOT INSIDE. With the A7ii, it's all about image stabilization. The in body stabilization is actually a big deal. That's why you pay the premium for this camera over a first generation body. If you shoot with lenses that lack OSS (and that includes all legacy lenses) then it makes sense to get the A7ii. It's like getting a nice across-the-board upgrade to your lens collection. It's extremely cool to attach a 40-year old Nikkor 105mm and enjoy the benefits of stabilization. I have a host of Nikkors and some unstabilized E-mount (including the superb Zeiss FE55) that benefit.Of course the ergonomic improvements of the A7ii are welcome. I'm sure that many professionals will upgrade to the A7ii simply for the relocated shutter release button and improved grip.The 24MP sensor of the A7ii is basically the same as that used in the A7. If you want a high resolution mirrorless monster, you want the A7R.If you are heavily interested in VIDEO, your decision may come down to the A7ii versus the A7S. You might think of it this way: the A7S is a video camera that takes stills, while the A7ii is a stills camera that takes great video. While ""steadyshot inside"" certainly helps with handheld shooting of video on the A7ii, lowlight performance trails the A7S. If you must have the King of Lowlight Video, you still want the A7S.Because I shoot both video and stills I debated between the A7ii and the A7S. It was a difficult choice, but I ultimately decided that the superlative all around performance of the A7ii was best for me.I have owned (and in some cases still own) cameras from Nikon, Canon, Panasonic, Fuji, and Olympus. At the moment there's literally not an apples-for-apples competitor to this Sony camera. I buy the camera that is the best for my needs and am not loyal to one brand. Lately it seems that SONY is the company that's delivering innovation and excitement in this space. While Nikon and Canon have gingerly tested the waters of mirrorless camera design (no doubt to protect their existing DSLR product lines), Sony has been fearlessly pushing ahead with groundbreaking technology. Sony makes the sensors, and is hungry for market share; we photographers are reaping the benefits.Today, I find the A7ii the best general purpose full frame camera on the market. It's compact, solidly built but not too heavy, plays nice with a huge number of lenses, and is packed full of AMAZING technology. It just does everything (stills and video) very well. And by the way, the price is quite reasonable considering all it delivers. It's one of the most affordable full frame cameras you can buy. If you purchase one, I think you will enjoy it."
"This is a fantastic camera and I've been through plenty of cameras. This is the one I'll be keeping. A little history... My first DSLR (9ish years ago) was a Nikon D40. I quickly outgrew that and bought a D90. After I while I wanted more. I got myself a D700 and that was a fantastic camera.  At some point I got sick of the weight of heavy cameras and lenses. I sold all of my Nikon gear and bought a Sony Nex7. I loved the light weight...but I was never happy with the image quality. Sooo...back to Nikon. Bought a D7100 and a bunch of lenses. I took a trip to Italy and midway through the trip decided that I needed to look at other options. Once again I was sick of carrying around all that weight. I planned to sell my Nikon stuff (again) and look back at the mirrorless options. I never got the chance because my camera bag was stolen on the way to Milan. Once I got home I started investigating my options. I tried an Olympus E-M1 but that didn't suit me. It's a nice camera but just wasn't up to the standard in image quality that I was used to. Next, I tried the Fuji X-T1. That is a beautiful machine. I would've been happy with it...If I hadn't also tried out the Sony a7. I was happier with the image quality from the Sony, but happier with the feel of the Fuji camera. In the end, image quality won and I kept the Sony. For my type of photography (landscapes, portraits) the Sony fit me very well. The autofocus was acceptable, but not great. But with my kind of work this isn't that big a deal. But I was never happy with the quality of the actual camera body. Just felt a little cheap. Then the a7ii was announced and I decided to trade up. While the camera is a bit heavier, the trade off of AMAZING handling makes it well worth it. The camera oozes quality and feels much nicer to hold than any other mirrorless camera I have tried. The in-body image stabilization is also great. I can handhold with the 55 1.8 at 1/4 second pretty consistently. I can get good images slower that that too, but they are more hit-or-miss. Still, the fact that I CAN get clear images at 1 second is insane. Autofocus is also noticeably better than on the a7. It's not in the same league as a Nikon DSLR like my old D7100, but for me that's not a big deal. If I were shooting sports then the Sony would be out...simple as that.For me, this is pretty much the perfect camera. I'm using it with the FE 55mm f1.8 and FE 16-35mm f4. I also have a Rokinon 85mm f1.4 (replaced my Nikon 85 1.4G that was stolen) and I just ordered a Canon FD 135mm f2.0 for portraits.  That pretty much covers all my needs. Very very happy with this camera.Oh, I also got a Nissin i40 flash for Christmas and it is a great match with this camera when you need it. It's remarkably powerful for its size and doesn't look ridiculous on the a7ii."
"It may not be the newest fancy model, but the colour quality is great. The camera boots up quickly and focusses quickly as well even in fairly low light. Also by using adapters, I can use 35mm full frame glass and APS-c smaller frame lens I have collected over the years. The 5 axis stabilization works perfectly with current Sony E-mount lenses and 3 axis (more basic) is the default stability for all other glass including everything from screw mount 50 year old glass to Minolta 20 year old glass with AF. Great addition to my kit."
"Sony has very nice cameras; this model, I think, is a good deal for photographers, not videographers... I wasn't sure that I want to switch from Nikon, but I like the concept of using same lenses for a6000 series and A7 series :-)"
This article is very well done. It is robust and of high quality.
"Still learning how to use all the options. I was able to buy some old glass lenses for about $30 (28mm, 50mm) and take some outstanding portraits and landscapes. Very versatile."
"Excellent camera, I’ve really grown to love it. Keep in mind the battery life isn’t the best I would suggest a battery grip for anyone that is more then occasional shooter."
"This drone is incredible. bought it as a birthday gift to myself, i've been using it for 8 months now and it has been flawless. small learning curve to get going for the first flight, but after the first time or two flying it takes only a minute to go from bag to flying in the air.the battery life is phenomenal, i typically only charge one or two batteries when i go to fly the drone, i never end up flying long enough to use all three batteries. the range isn't quite as good as advertised unless you're on a mountain and have clear line of sight between the controller and drone, but i've found i can still get up to a mile on average in the places i go (trees, buildings) before losing signal.this drone is impressively stable in the wind. i have flown it in some pretty strong wind gusts and even while in the process of landing it will correct for even a strong wind gust, i'm just blown away at how stable this drone is in the wind. i have flown it in the wind with other people around and they cannot believe how stable it is either. after showing my dad this drone once, my mom bought him one as an anniversary gift.the smart controller is 1,000% worth the money. I don't have to worry about attaching my phone to the controller or forcing my screen brightness up to max in the daylight, or my phone battery dying, or not being able to text while i'm flying (haha). With the smart controller I can ALWAYS see the screen clearly and easily, other people have been blown away by the clarity and stability of the video. Since i don't need my phone attached to the controller I can take pictures or record video of the drone from my phone while flying. I highly highly recommend getting the smart controllerthis makes flying pretty easy. i have only ever flown outside, but in 8 months of flying so far i haven't even had to replace a single propeller blade. this thing just works and works easily and amazingly. i love that it's small enough to take with me on day hikes or to put in my motorcycle bag to take up north"
"I am amazed by how far drone technology has come in the past few years.  This dji drone is a capable and well built tool that has exceeded my expectations.Pros:Decent 4k video and stabilization.  Not quite as good as an iPhone 12 or GoPro but pretty good.Very easy to use with the smart controller.  The smart controller provides a very nice and intuitive experience.Feature rich and very nice drone effects.  The quickshots are awesome and only take seconds.Good battery life and stable even in moderate winds (tested to ~15mph)Solid and well built!  Very impressed with the build quality.  This is not a toy.The drone performance is optimized for video and battery life, not speed or maneuverability.Cons:Tracking of anything but people or cars, is not great. Quickshots will often fail if tracking fails.Haven't had great luck with active track either but haven't used some of the more advanced features.It would be great if they had some gps or ir tags for difficult to track objectsHand takeoff and grabbing the drone out of the air would be nice.  Landing not very useful when in a kayak...Aside from issues with optical tracking, this drone has exceeded all my expectations. This has become my go to videography tool.  Small enough to take nearly anywhere with confidence inspiring flight performance. The fly more package is a nice addition that gives roughly 1.5 hours of flight."
"Amazon told me to review ""thickness, easy to learn, for beginners"". That's a weird combination of things, but here we go:Nah.So this is a good drone for moderate skill levels. It's pretty fast, has a very long battery life, and takes fantastic images. I've been using drones since the Spark came out, about 4 or 5 years years now. I've flown a Phantom 3, Spark, Mavic Air, and now this. I've also flown FPV drones for a few years.Pro:- large propeller, ""heavy"" drone makes handling wind better- good sensor- digital megapixel rendering- smart modes for easier video shots- long battery life- computer assisted takeoff and landingCon:- too smart for its own good (similar with most DJI drones, let the operator operate)- can be hard to learn for a beginner- expensive to learn on- sensor not the best for low light (make up for this by using Smart Photo or AEB)I use this for taking artsy photos. I would use this for real estate too if anybody would hire me. You can't really attach LIDAR or anything to this drone so surveying wouldn't be an ideal use. I mostly enjoy that I can be in the air for 20-30 minutes at a time."
"While it is not cheap if you get the smart controller, it is a high quality drone and the Smart controller is easy to use and simplifies everything and the start up times are greatly reduced by not having to hook up a phone and starting an app. The camera is excellent and the filters are good for shooting in different lighting conditions. I'm still learning all about the Air 2, having flown a Mavic Mini helped a lot.  If you can afford the Smart controller, get it."
"I found it hard to start up, once i got it flying i liked how stable it remained and the resolution was very good. you will not find much youtube orientation for the smart controller. but it's out there, look for it. It helped a lot for beginners like me."
"Upgraded from the original Mavic Air and immediately noticed a difference. Yes, it’s a little bigger but it’s also built better and sturdier. Definitely recommend getting the smart controller as you don’t need to attach a phone and it’s just so much more intuitive and let’s you save to internal memory.Photo quality is awesome and the clarity is worth the upgrade."
"I purchased this drone.  Upon opening it it was obvious someone else had flown it.  I attempted to complete the IMU calibration, however, whenever it completed it would simply cause an error.  I did a couple hours of research and came to the following conclusions:  1) Drone was in a crash or 2) Drone has been in an upright position for such an extended period of time that the IMU has gone faulty and needs to be replaced.Either way, clearly not happy with the product provided to me and have started a return.  Since it was a discounted warehouse deal a replacement would not be issued.  Just writing this review to hopefully safe the next person from the same outcome I got."
"Love drone and the dji product. However if looking to purchase this from amazon I strongly recommend you do not. I purchased this and it arrived defective and not working. Amazing was going to credit me 20% but backed out in there word. They won’t do anything for me!!If you go to purchase anything expensive I recommend you purchase it from the actual site, and not Amazon.Very disappointed in the customer service and satisfaction from the Amazon team."
"My husband got this unit to go with his DJI Pro 4.  He immediately noticed the sharpness on the screen and the clearness of the pictures.  It worked from the very beginning and continues to do a great job!  This is  our second one as the first had an issue, but they had us send it right back and we had a replacement within three days --and even over a weekend!  Great service and an even better unit and experience!"
