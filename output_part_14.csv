"This game is a must for couples, especially new relationships. Had a blast playing it with my girlfriend!"
It's a great game. I can spend hours playing it over and over because of its strategic and sneaky gameplay. I love it!
It is a highly fun group game of elimination. The increased allowment of players is great for group gammes.
Simple and fun. It's a great card game.
I've had all the other expansions for the game and thought it was time to add to my collection. This has some of the best cards from each expansion and has enough for me to add more players when we play. Super fun
A great addition to the Screaming Kittens game.  Best game ever!!

"We did an early Christmas exchange at our Thanksgiving gather.  With 12 people with ages ranging from 13 to 75, this game was amazing.  We laughed with and at each others knowledge and mistakes.  What a wonder game to keep the family together.  Four teens actually put their phones down and asked to join the fun.I am very pleased that we selected this game to give as a gift this year."
"Bought this for a road trip over the summer. Lots of different questions, but a lot of random questions that I didn't even know the answers to.Was still fun learning new random facts."
I got this for a trip and decided to play it once with a friend before the trip. We had a lot of fun playing this and a lot of laughs.
Questions are great for multigenerational family fun.
"I took this to a recent family dinner. The directions are flexible - we played in teams and awarded points for each correct answer. Each team had a card and asked questions - one at a time - to the team on their left, The problem was the discrepancy in the challenge level of individual questions and cards. There are four questions on each card and we assumed they got harder from top to bottom. This was true with the first card since the last answer was a French term none of the players had ever heard before. The thought, “I should know this.” did not surface. However, the next card had no difficult questions and the following one had multiple difficult questions. It was just luck of the draw with no indication of a card’s difficulty level. This game is demoted to road trip trivia."
"fun game, family and friends enjoyed it. There’s some really funny answers as well as those answers that you say oh that’s right they must buy for family game night.!"
Outstanding game and great for young teenagers and up.  With this game you can play by the game rules or make up your own!
Great little game for a weekend games day with the kids
It’s a fun game that made us say “I should have known that!” more times than we can count 😂Would definitely recommend buying and playing it!
"I bought this classic version of Battleship because in the past, the electronic version always breaks too easily. This version is simple and straight forward with no electronic sounds. That way you can just sit down and play and there nothing much to break. It' also build solid, so it could last for many years!"
"Great classic game. Teaches strategy, comes with a durable case to keep everything organized. Great value for money."
fun and packaged well
Our family loves this game. It’s a great travel size. The cases are durable. The numbers and letters on bottom are not very readable. The pegs sometimes fall out when the cases are bumped. They came in good condition. Over all our kids love this game with us and we really enjoy how easy it is to pack up on trips.
"Great game, both sets lock together which saves space and helps you from losing one half or the other"
"This a fine version of the classic Battleship game. It is well packaged and easy to manipulate the parts. So I can recommend this version of the game. Of course one big benefit is that there are no screens with this game. The game itself has always appealed, and fortunately it still does. Our 8 year-old grandson loves playing it- he gets so excited when he ""blows"" something up."
This was a great gift for my grandson. We have spent hours playing this game and it comes package very well. I would definitely recommend this. Makes family night so much fun!
Love battleship and can’t wait to play it with my son.
"The fun, straightforward childhood game I missed so much.This updated set is better functionally than the old ones too. Being able to sit further apart and be comfortable is so nice. The way it packs up and clips together makes it very convenient for transport. All the pieces feel of decent quality and looks cool too. Still have a lot of fun playing this game and it's so easy to teach those who haven't played before.Got it for $17.09 and it's so worth it."
Well packaged and fast delivery thanks
"I used to play battleships when they had those black squarish boxes and the pins would fall into a crevice if not placed properly.This box set is a nice upgrade from the past, a lot slimmer with great fit for the pins and the ships. They won’t fall out easily and hold secure if you’re playing on a moving vehicle.Naturally though, I wouldn’t recommend playing on a moving vehicle because if the unsecured pins spill, good luck picking them up."
Such a great classic game!!
"The images on the board need to be a much higher resolution because they're a bit blurry. As for the missed opportunity for the jail (Azkaban) I understand why they didn't do it, even still would have been nice. The house points probably should've been plastic instead of cardboard since they will be handled a lot as the currency. Otherwise everything else is well made and really nice. Overall, it's a good game and definitely worth getting!"
It did justice to the movies. Even the box is awesome. Great for play or for the collection.
This was the best birthday gift ever for my little Harry Potter fan. It combines our love for Monopoly with our love for Hogwarts in a game that’s winnable in less than 2 hrs! Super funI played with a 5 and 8yr old. Great for the 8 yr old.
It’s very similar to the original game. The few differences help the game move along a little quicker and actually end without hours and hours of playing. The Harry Potter theme and game pieces are a really nice touch. I will definitely play this game again without hesitation of wondering if I have the time and patience. Definitely a good buy.
I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. It came in great condition and at a  decent time. I can't wait to see her face when she opens it on Christmas. We both love harry potter. Can't wait to play it with her and the family.
Makes it fun for a fan of Harry Potter
"I had this in my cart for about 6 months and when it was finally available for prime delivery I ordered immediately. We collect basically every version of Monopoly in our house. Being a Potterhead made this even more special. The gold tokens must be made out of galleons! Their so fancy! Great selection of famous HP staples turned tokens, that every Potter head would appreciate! I call dibs on the Firebolt and and Buckbeak usually! The Headwig chance (owl mail) card holder is beautiful and well made! My daughter thinks it's a toy and tries to play with it when we're not playing the game! The money coins (house points) are ok. I like how they call it house points, however, it could have been made from better material. The cardboard won't last long and/or will go missing if your not mindful of them. I suggest a ziplock bag for safe keeping. The best part of the game is...the BOARD!! It feels like your actually in Hogwarts! Or maybe it's just my vivid childlike imagination taking me on a ride!! The photos are so vivid and accurate! Makes you want to buy every property!Overall, the game was worth its price tag. The game premise, tokens, board, ""free ""Headwig toy (lol) and the fact that it's Harry Potter makes it a great addition for Monopoly collectors!  I would buy this for any age HP fan!After reading this, I will point my wand at you and say""Oblivate"". Now you won't know what the game is about until you read the instructions! Enjoy!"
The box looks Awesome!!It arrived in excellent condition!I haven’t opened it to explore more quality because it is a gift but I have an excellent feeling about this one!I highly recommend!
"I have been waiting for a Harry Potter themed Monopoly forever and was so excited when I discovered this one! I was expecting it to be exactly like the original Monopoly with just updated property names, etc. but there are actually a few brand new features, which did not spoil the integrity of the Monopoly game as I’d feared, but turned out to enhance the game in a Harry Potter-appropriate way.There are two major things that I have found different with this version of the game. The first is that it is a much quicker game than other traditional Monopoly games. This is, I think, due to the fact that properties are purchased with House Points instead of money, and the points only come in 10s and 50s.Secondly, the Chance and Community Chest cards are now combined and are called Owl Post (including some Howlers!). With the exception of Go to Jail and Get Out of Jail Free cards, all the instructions on the Owl Post cards are different from traditional Chance and Community Chest cards but they are AWESOME and very Harry Pottery!I love this game, and highly recommend it for any Harry Potter fan!"
Fun board game for kids who love Harry Potter..
We stopped playing the original monopoly after this!! Love the harry potter version..
My kids collect special addition Monopolies and I am so excited to play this one.  Good price and quick delivery.
"How can you go wrong with this classic masterpiece!? I love the case it comes with! Helps to keep the cards in order, not bent, easy to travel with. Fun to have the wild cards you can write your own rules on! Definitely makes for an interesting fun fmaily game night!Worth the buy I promise!"
Great game classic for every family. Easy enough for school age kids and elderly. Cards are colorful and durable. Easy to shuffle. Great gift for the price. Highly recommend!
"Remember when families and friends actually played board games, and card games? Instead of a living room with no conversation, just a bunch of people tapping and swiping their phones? Well getting this UNO set can help you relive some of the magic from the good old days. When everyone actually had fun and interacted with each other.Believe it or not, I forgot how to play UNO. Which is weird, considering how much I played it when I was younger. Even as a young adult. But just like riding a bike, you never really lose it. Open the tin, break out the cards and the rule sheet. And in a minute, it all came back. So easy to play, that even toddlers can participate.BONUS TIP: HOW TO GET EVEN THE SMALLEST KIDS INVOLVEDSo Mattel recommends that kids ages 7 and up can play. But any kid 4-6 can most likely grasp the basic rules, as long as they can recognize numbers. The catch is that it may not hold the attention of a five year old all that great. But there's a way that you can still put the UNO cards to good use, while enjoying some bonding time with your little ones. Here's what I figured out, after a couple of games of UNO with our Little Girl....Make it a memory game. What I did was go through the cards, and picked out two identical ones for different numbers/colors. So two green 5 cards. Two red 4 cards. Two blue 2 cards. Two yellow 7 cards. I tried to avoid sixes and nines. Basically take eight to twelve cards in total. Then place them in two to three rows, face down (UNO side up). I'd ask our Daughter to flip a card over. Yellow 7. Okay, now try to find the other Yellow 7. And she gets to flip over another card. If it's not the right one, I let her know that was a really good try. Now let's flip the cards over, and try it again. If she gets it right, I congratulate her, and she gets so excited. This way, she can play a simple game that also helps her work on her memory skills. So she can remember where certain cards were, and match them up. When she does well with six cards, I bump it up to eight cards. Then ten cards. It's simple, but fun for the smaller kids that may lose interest in actually playing UNO. And she still gets to have fun with the rest of us.There are no negatives about this set. The only thing that could have possibly been improved, is to have made the tin a tiny bit more travel-friendly. The two stacks of cards are held in plastic, inside of the tin. But it seems like they could have simply made the tin much smaller, and still fit the cards in. Making it a bit easier to just stick in your pocket. That's not a dealbreaker, just thinking out loud. Otherwise, the quality of the cards and tin are both great.Look. It's ten bucks. That's it. People spend more than that on two iced coffees, or a drive-through at a fast food place. But those are things you only get to enjoy once. Whereas you could use these cards in this tin for well over a decade. Plus you can make it a family tradition, or have fun when friends come over. It's advertised as a kid's game. But truth be told, we played it more in our dorm's game room than I ever did as a child. UNO never gets old. Why put it off? Add it to your shopping cart. You've got the ten bucks to spare, right now. Check out. It will show up at your home in as soon as a day, if you have Prime free shipping. And you can take that ten dollars, and turn it into million dollar memories with your family. But you can't do that, if you don't order it. So buy a set today, you'll be thankful you did."
I work with children and am always engaging them with a game of Uno.  They love this new variety of Uno game.  Thank you UNO>5 Stars.  Love the tin it came in.  Fun game. I would buy this again.  Looking forward to trying a few more of the new Uno Varietys.
"Good game, easy to play"
Always a fun game! Played by kiddos (ages 4 and 7). Great game!
"The Mattel Games UNO Card Game has become a staple in our family game nights, and for good reason! This classic card game never fails to entertain both kids and adults alike with its simple rules and endless possibilities. Whether we're at home or traveling, UNO is our go-to game for making memories and sharing laughs.The beauty of UNO lies in its versatility. It's easy enough for young children to grasp, yet strategic and exciting for older players. The deck includes a variety of action cards that add an extra layer of excitement, keeping everyone on their toes until the very end.Additionally, the compact size of the UNO deck makes it perfect for taking on the go. Whether it's a road trip, a plane ride, or a weekend getaway, UNO is always packed and ready to entertain. Plus, it makes for a fantastic gift for kids of all ages, ensuring hours of fun for the whole family."
Hands down the best version of UNO we have played to date.. I Highly recommend. This makes the version changes the strategy & makes the game significantly more fun. Only possible improvement would be to make a waterproof version for poolside usage.
"I bought these for Father's Day for my dad (75). He's not colourblind, but both of my parents have trouble distinguishing colour in low-light, which we often have if we play during the evenings at the lake. It's also nice for them to have the tin, as it's a lot easier for them to put away compared to the cardboard case we have at home.The only complaint, and it's minor, is the 6 and 9 are a little more difficult to distinguish compared to the other deck we have at home. Still takes dad a bit of getting used to. But again, a very minor issue, and I would still fully recommend."
"I already owned this version of Uno, so I bought this one for someone else, who had liked mine.  Mine is in a regular box, but I wish all card games would be released in tins, as they are more durable.  The tin wasnâ€™t available when I bought my own game.My friend is happy with the game and it being in a tin is a bonus to him!ðŸŽ‰"
"Combining dodgeball with a card game is a brilliant idea, and it’s a lot of fun to play with friends and family. The rules are easy to understand, and the game is highly engaging. Highly recommend for game nights."
Exploding kittens makes the best games! This one is super active and so much fun!
"Fun active game. Our children love the action of throwing the soft burritos. Even when thrown what would seem hard, still doesn't cause any physical discomfort. With adults its the same and you can make it a drinking game to add to the adult fun if you choose to. Great for family/friends game night."
"I didn’t know I’d be scrubbing blood out of the living room carpet on Christmas Day at 10:30p.m., but there I was, having to decide whether I pull out cleaning solution or if I just call it a night and go to bed. It’s all still a bit of a blur, but for proper context, allow me to start from the beginning.My teenage sister loves family board games, and Exploding Kittens is a favorite of hers. She’s mentioned a few times this year that she really, really wanted to try Throw Throw Burrito. Being the amazing older sister that I am, I added this to my Amazon cart and had it shipped to me to wrap for her to open Christmas morning. Did I do my research? No, this is where I made a grave mistake, but more on that later. When my sister tore the paper on Christmas morning to find this long-awaited game, thrilled shouts rang out around the room from fellow family members who looked forward to playing. The pride of a great gift given washed over me in this moment, and I took another sip of hot coffee, happy with the successful purchase. Looking back to that moment, I now see just how naive I was.After Christmas dinner had been eaten and the rest of dessert polished off, 6 of us gathered in the living room and sat down in a big circle on the floor to play Throw Throw Burrito. As I was reading the instructions, I grew concerned. Even though the name is “Throw Throw Burrito,” somehow I thought it would be more like “Toss Toss Burrito.” I swallowed my concern and we dealt everyone in. The game starts and we’re getting the hang of it and it’s a little aggressive...and then someone called a duel. I don’t remember who or how I ended up standing back-to-back with my younger brother who is a head taller and twice my size, but next thing I knew someone yelled “3...2...1... Burrito!” and I was no longer in the living room. Adrenaline surged through my veins and I was on a battlefield. I tried to dodge a burrito and chuck one all at the same time, and we both missed. Glass bulbs clanged on the Christmas tree, other players shouted from the sidelines, and I scrambled to find a burrito on the floor before my brother could get the other and hit me with it. Only thing is—I couldn’t find it. It was lost to me forever, so I had one option: run. I ran faster than I’ve ever run in my adult life as this grown, built-like-bull beast of a man chased me around the living room, nearly causing an earthquake to rupture across the American Midwest. I had nowhere to turn but to keep running around the room before he could hit me. This is where things start to get fuzzy, because my heart is racing and I’m running for my EVER. LOVING. LIFE. Suddenly, my foot slides against a game card and I fly, falling face-down into the carpet. I lie there for a second trying to process all that just transpired when I feel the harrowing finality of a burrito hitting me in the back. The competitive screams turn to silence, and someone says, “Uh, you ok?”I carefully pick myself—and my pride—up off the floor. We all make our way back into the circle, the game we once played long gone, scattered in a disarray across the room. Some announced how this was the most fun they’d ever had during a card game, and still reconciling in my mind what just occurred, I let them know that no one could ever convince me to play this awful game again.My sister rolled her eyes and we straightened the cards best we could to get back to the round at hand. I feel my foot throbbing and I look down, only to see blood running down the side of it. I’m not sure at what point I was injured during my burrito civil war, but there was a gash on my foot. “I’m bleeding!” I exclaim, and my fellow players just start laughing. We finished the game around 10:30 in the evening, and I left to properly bandage my foot. I come back and as we’re putting the game away I see a blood stain in the white carpet where I had fallen just minutes prior. The big question now was, do I scrub the blood out of my mother’s white carpet, or just call it a night? Who knew this is how the Christmas of 2020 would draw to a close?All that being said, buyer beware: this is no game of “Toss Toss Burrito.” This, indeed, is “Throw Throw Burrito,” and may bring out a new side you’ve never seen before of the people you play with. And, bad mood and wounded pride aside, it was actually pretty fun. We played it again last night and while bulbs clanged against the Christmas tree again, no one was majorly injured. The burritos are already cracked and one is missing a chunk, so I don’t think they’ll last very long, but Throw Throw Burrito is quite the entertaining game nonetheless.All I can say now, fellow potential purchaser, is good luck."
Very fun and chaotic for the whole family.
Really nothing wrong with a game that involves dueling burritos. Just fun and easy to understand.
"The game is fun, it is fast-paced, and it was a really good therapy tool for my kid with selective mutism as it encourages verbal interaction in a fun setting. Younger kids can play alongside older kids and adults. Great game!"
"We're hosting an extended family game night next week and I wanted something new & different to play that everyone would enjoy. Our family loves rummy, PIT! and other card games so I figured I'd give 'Throw Throw Burrito' a try, even though we've never played or purchased 'Exploding Kittens' or any other of their games. And also even though someone in my family tends to injure themselves every single time we all get together.Yesterday when this arrived, my husband and I sat down to learn how to play so that we can teach everyone else on game night. It is easy to learn and appropriate for all ages. It was great fun playing this, even with just two people, and it'd be a lot more fun with a bigger group.So I matched the 'Burrito War' cards which means everyone grabs for a burrito and throw it at another player. I whipped a burrito at my husband's chest except it accidentally hit him in the face because 1) I have terrible (or great?) aim and 2) we were sitting at very close range to each other.Consequently, he informed me that 'we' are not allowed to play this game anymore. When he said 'we' I knew he meant me. I am not allowed to play because I cannot be trusted to not hit him in the face with a squishy burrito. He hid the box but I know where and I am totally breaking this out on family game night!"
"My son is 9 and this is the game he always wants to play on game night.  It's an easy game to learn and lots of kids/people can play at the same time.  Only thing is, play somewhere where you won't be afraid something may be knocked over by a flying burrito!  Good game for birthday parties too."
