"Growing up, the Peanuts gang was a staple in my household. From the classic television specials to the beloved movies like Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown and the iconic holiday specials, these characters hold a special place in my heart. That's why when I came across the Peanuts 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle, I knew I had to give it a try.Putting together this puzzle was like taking a trip down memory lane. Each piece I connected brought a smile to my face as I recreated scenes from my favorite childhood memories. The challenge of the puzzle was just right - not too easy, but not too difficult either. It was the perfect way to spend a nostalgic afternoon, lost in the world of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and the rest of the gang.Overall, I highly recommend this puzzle for anyone who, like me, holds a deep affection for the Peanuts characters. It's a fun and rewarding way to relive those cherished moments from the past."
"Enjoyable and keepable experienceI really enjoyed this puzzle becauseIllustration is quite different than your ordinary photography. You now have to match the thickness of lines and hue, color variations and the faintest of difference. It really was challenging and fun. I am a tried and true snoopy fan so I was absolutely thrilled to see so many depictions of snoopy in one puzzle. This one is a keeper, I will frame it and continue to enjoy it.  No missing pieces or extra pieces just simple fun!"
"This was one of 2 puzzles I ordered/gave away as Christmas gifts recently. Both were excellent in quality, colours, fit, price etc. Totally recommended. I would give a full 5 star rating but 1 piece is missing. We do not have kids, no pets ate it, searched high and low in a very minimal room where we put the puzzle together. We are very sad that this piece is missing altogether. We spent HOURS putting it together, which was totally fun! So we're not going to take it apart and return it now."
Well made. Adorable. Fun for family. Thank you.
Galison puzzles are always wonderful and high quality. This one was especially beautiful with the metallic accents throughout. Every piece is solid and fits together perfectly. You can't ask for a better holiday puzzle!  LOVE it and highly recommend.
This puzzle is beautiful. I love the gold foil accents. There is no dust detritus and the pieces snap in nicely.
I love Galison puzzles and the foil ones are especially beautiful.  The snap together so nicely and so well you can lift the whole completed puzzle without it falling apart.
"Beautiful colors in an enchanting scene. Pieces hold together well, and need some effort to take apart when finished.  Overall, the puzzle is great and would recommend."
"I gave this to my daughter, who loves 1000 piece puzzles, and she told me how pretty it was and also challenging. After finishing it, she brought it to our house, and it stayed together without anything under it. We are thinking of framing it! Will definitely be getting her more of these. Very good price for the quality and pretty scenes!!"
This puzzle was quite the challenge at times but that’s what makes it such great value for money! The colors are rich and vibrant and I loved the gold foil accents. The pieces fit really well together and you can truly pick it up by the corner and it all stays together. Highly recommend it.
"I really enjoyed assembling this one! The foil accents really make this puzzle “pop”! The vertical layout made it a bit awkward to assemble at times, but worth the wait. I will be looking for more of these foiled puzzles in the future."
Love the gilded highlights on the puzzle. Puzzle box came in a plastic sleeve that protected the picture.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



We loved putting this together. The gold foil is beautiful! It was very sturdy and didn’t want to come apart—if you were wanting to modpodge this it would be very easy."
"You can't go wrong with a Galison jigsaw for quality and art, and this is no different. Beautiful puzzle."
"was expecting a 500 piece puzzle as described, however it was clearly a 1000 piece puzzle.  Returned and re-ordered and got the same results.  Returned second puzzle.  Disappointing."
"I was expecting finishing the puzzle before Christmas so I can put it on the wall for the holiday deco. Unfortunately, when I finally got to the end, I realized there were totally 10 pieces missing. Since I kept everything on a big table and was separate from other stuff, I couldn't think anywhere else that I might be able to find them. I have to return it since there's no hope to get it done before Christmas, even though I could ask for a replacement."
"This is the first time I’ve ordered from the brand and I was intrigued by the foil pieces. I ordered two puzzles at the same time and received one puzzle a day later than the other. The first puzzle I received does not have any foil on the pieces (disappointing); foil only on the box image of the puzzle. Since it’s the first time I’ve ordered from this brand and a foil puzzle, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect. The second puzzle arrived today, winter lights, and this does have gold foil on the individual pieces in addition to the box, so I don’t know if I just got it defective version of the Presentville puzzle, that has no pieces with actual foil."
I absolutely love this busy city at Christmas time seen with foil accents. It was fun to do and very well-made. It’s beautiful when finished! Highly recommend this brand and this puzzle!
"After I finished it, I glued it with Mod Podge Puzzle Saver (2 layers) and hung it on the wall with Velcro Command Strips. It’s so cute!"
"Fun design, and I like the added sparkles to it."
"This was a gorgeous puzzle and we had a great time doing it. It was relatively easy -- it only took us (two adults) two hours to complete, which is not very long for a 500 piece puzzle. Overall really satisfied with the product. The gold foil was gorgeous!"
This puzzle was great quality and beautiful. So nice to put together.
"Buy these Gallison 500 winter/Christams puzzles now, because they will be very popular."
"This puzzle has a bright, cheerful holiday graphic with foil accents that make it festive and a bit enchanting. Quality is good - printing is clear. The cuts are clean, joints are tight.  Most of the pieces are distinctive enough to identify but there are also challenging areas to change things up and slow the process down. I  expect I will do it again in years to come. It was a great value."
"Wait it for one month, but love it so muchBeautiful"
It’s amazing because of the many piece and I loved the picture.
"There is no missing or defective piece in box, authenic product."
"Quality and thickness of this puzzle is what I am used to in the quality and standard of puzzles. I’m very satisfied with this purchase. I have not completed the puzzle yet, but it is very entertaining for me. To me it is not very difficult because every bird has its own colors And distinctions so it’s pretty easy to find the pieces that go with each bird. The nicest thing is that they add a very large color print of the puzzle to help you look up close to see if you can match a piece to where it goes. I think the hard part will be filling in the background. I have completed most of the birds. I glue them and frame them when I finish them, and use them as pictures on the wall. And just FYI if you are new to gluing puzzles, use puzzle glue and a paintbrush that is wide and thin. Mine is about 1 1/2 inches wide with bristles that will not fall out, so they don’t get stuck to your puzzle. once the top side of the puzzle is dry flip it and glue the backside as well if you intend to frame it and hang it After it is dry. Do not glue your puzzle on a valuable piece of furniture. I use a card table. The glue will wipe off after you complete gluing it. Enjoy!"
"Enjoyed putting this puzzle together.  Not too hard, but hard enough."
Can't wait to put this puzzle together reminds me of spring.  Recommend this company for their pzzles
"this one was glued together, and is currently hanging on someone's wall in the middle east"
"This puzzle is beautiful and also very challenging! I bought a puzzle frame for it because I love it so much! Unfortunately it is missing a piece. I look absolutely everywhere and did not find the piece, so one can only assume that it was left out of the box prior to shipment. The product support doesn’t resolve this issue, as they “can’t” send me a replacement puzzle. It’s very disappointing and it makes me think I’ll buy puzzles in the future from a different brand with a product support that actually resolves issues like this."
"It’s a little bit of a hard puzzle to do, but so nice when finished! I’ll probably frame this one!"
"Bought as gift for wife and she was just thrilled working this puzzle. Really detailed picture. In fact, so nice looking you don’t want to take it apart."
The picture is being once finished and we will frame itMy husband loves doing puzzles during the grey winter months when most activities are in the house. So he has it set up in the living room on a puzzle table which was also a great purchase as easy to set up and leave for anyone else wanting to try .He has done 2 other 1000 piece puzzle but this one is particularly difficult . It’s deceiving because one thinks that because it has different coloured birds it would be a cinch . It’s not ! This is why I bought it because the other two puzzles were not too hard and finished quickly. A good way to get into puzzles though is to start with easier 1000 piece puzzle. I picked the puzzle with the purpose of framing and hanging in houseThey really look nice framed
Happy with the quality
Title says it all. Highly recommended.
A decently build puzzle that offers a good thickness that allowes the puzzle to be built on a puzzle board. Amazing color as well as all correct pieces (non missing). I get puzzles for my mom all fall and winter as she can complete a 1000 piece puzzle in a week so they are constant purchases. I highly encourage others to try it out!
"Nice puzzle, fits well and looks great"
I enjoyed the picture and vibrant colors but this one was challenging for me.  I thought I was advanced at puzzles but this one was difficult in my opinion.  Still enjoyed it though. Missing one piece  but it's possibly my fault.
"Enjoyed this puzzle.Pros:- Nice quality pieces.- Nice colors.- Fit together snugly.- Letter codes on the back help with sorting the pieces so you can work on a section of the puzzle at a time.Cons:- Shiny finish, so there's a glare from overhead lights. A matte or linen finish would be much easier and nicer.- Fairly normal piece shapes.- I wasn't a fan of the areas that were devoid of graphics, leaving the puzzler with having to put together two mostly black areas of the puzzle and some other areas of blank background, but that's due to the pattern I chose to purchase. I'll watch for that in future purchases.I would buy this brand again if they went to a matte or linen finish. Extra bonus if they add unusual piece shapes.Four stars due to my personal cons/preferences in puzzles. If these things don't bother you, then you'll probably enjoy this puzzle."
I bought this for a gift and the recipient was very pleased with the puzzle.
"The puzzle was challenging as expected.  But it was gorgeous when finished.  Pieces were made well; no problem with interlocking properly.  For someone who wants to have help, you may look on the reverse side of each piece for a letter that will let you know what part of the puzzle it will fit.  Of course, it doesn't give you the exact location, but it will give you a general idea of where the piece belongs.  This one takes time to finish."
I got this as a challenge for myself and it was definitely a challenge. Very beautiful though and a nice size
I love this puzzle because of the way the cardboard is made. The puzzle itself is beautiful. I have a dozen or more on my wall that I’ve made from this company product as well and the pictures are beautiful..
This puzzle was so much fun to put together. Different from all the Christmas scene puzzles.Nice size pieces and well made. Highly reccomend!
Love WM puzzles……The high quality puzzle pieces and images are the reason I only buy WM puzzles….
"Very cute, fun puzzle for the holidays.  I just finished it this morning.  It was made up of old Golden Books Christmas Carols of the past.  Many books were ones I had in  my youth.  This would be great fun to do with Children.  Not too hard, not too easy.  Very colorful."
"What a fun puzzle! NO missing pieces - in excellent new condition - exactly as advertised. As I was putting the puzzle together, I had to sing all of the Christmas carols that I was seeing. This would be a great family activity, especially before Christmas!"
"One piece was missing and one piece received two of the same.  Always love White Mountain puzzles, first time this has happened."
I really enjoyed putting this together. It’s not that hard to do but it’s a lot of fun. It would be a great family puzzle. Plus it’s really cute. I’ve been buying White Mountain jigsaws for years and have never had a problem with any of them
I love White Mt. Puzzles
Like that it is made in the USA
"I just love this puzzle. It's well made, and so much fun to put together."
Great puzzle and lovely quality. My favourite Xmas puzzle.
"BUFFALO brand jigsaw puzzles are colorful, detailed & glossy. The pieces snap together snug and don’t fall apart. The pieces are cut into varied shapes including zigzag. A large foldout photo of the puzzle is included in the box. This puzzle is good for SENIOR CITIZENS for stimulating brain activity, and fine motor skills (use of fingers). My 89 year old Father and I love to put BUFFALO brand puzzles together. Highly recommend"
"This puzzle was really tough to work, but it is really pretty.  I would recommend it."
"Very cute, fun and good quality puzzle."
"We love Buffalo puzzles. Our family put it together in a couple hours. No missing pieces, quality picture was great."
Fun puzzle to work.
East to put together
"Very, very disappointed that is puzzle pieces were not completely cut, so they were being torn apart where pieces come together. As you can see in picture I'm sending you, the pieces of the backing torn off is on the bottom left. I have been buying Buffalo puzzles for a long time, and lately, I have either gotten some with too much puzzle dust or the mentioned problem. The company seems to be using cheaper type of whatever it uses to make the puzzles. Yet, the prices keep going higher and higher. Other than that, I do like your country life series."
Pieces were not cut completely.
"I have at least a dozen buffalo games puzzles and love them, but I won’t be buying another Buffalo Games Puzzle in the near future.I am in competitive jigsaw competitions and used this puzzle to practice but we’re not allowed to look at the pieces ahead of time and have to accept the pieces as we find them. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get an accurate test because quite a few pieces were badly bent and twisted, and at least 30% of the puzzle was not cut properly. (Hanging chads as one reviewer pointed out.) I had to waste a lot of time trying to fix the pieces. This is not the standard I’m used to with buffalo puzzles and will notify all my puzzle groups."
"This is an enjoyable and colorful puzzle.  I did have a missing edge piece, which was disappointing, but noting the guarantee I contacted the company and they replaced the puzzle without hassle...good customer relations.The pieces are a bit thin and don't snap together like some puzzles.  If bumped it's easy to knock some out of place, but otherwise it was a fun puzzle...not too easy, not too difficult.  The picture is very nice, with an included poster to ease putting it together.  These are a change from the most common puzzle scenes, so will probably try some more from this company."
"This was an easier puzzle to finish than I expected. Sorting and building the border took a solid 3 hours. After that, I spent an additional 16 hours to complete the 1,000-piece puzzle. It's very detailed, super cute but some pieces were tricky to place. Overall, it was one of my favorites!"
"I love this puzzle not only because it shows a 1956 Packard, my first car, but has unique pieces.  They are shaped like no other puzzle i have worked on.  Even some very small pieces.  It doesn't lock together as tightly as the average puzzle, but it doesn't fall apart easily either.  The picture is interesting and very detailed.  I will be looking for another like this.  Especially one with old cars and trucks.  The cat and dogs were also a plus.  I highly recommend this puzzle."
It was a great puzzle. Fun to put together and pretty when done.
"I enjoyed putting this puzzle together, but was not happy with how the pieces fit together. Sometimes they did not lock into place which made it difficult to keep Parts of the puzzle together. No Missing pieces. Because of the many different colors it was less challenging then some puzzles, but I enjoyed it."
A great and fun puzzle.  David Maclean has wonderful designs and puzzle material is durable and sturdy.
