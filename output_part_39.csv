Spacious and stylish. Perfect for your gym items.
It‚Äôs durable and I use it so much
It‚Äôs a good gym  bag spacious with enough room for all your gym stuff and space for anything else you need to throw in without it looking bulky‚úîÔ∏è
"Not only is it super cute, but it‚Äôs also great quality! I love the colours and it has a little compartments that are really useful. I suggest getting it, whether it‚Äôs for a weekend getaway duffle bag or for the gym! You won‚Äôt regret it!"
"Sometimes you need a small duffel. Check the dimensions (14"" x 9"" x 8.5""). It is small (smaller than most) but perfect for: squeezing a locker at the gym or school, fitting below the seat in front on an airplane, tossing under the bench at a game, etc. It is the size of two shoe boxes (one on top of the other). It can hold one basketball/soccer ball, a phone, a small towel and a couple of drinks. It can hold one change of clothes, toiletries and a pair of shoes. It certainly is small but perfect for the right use. Our #1 choice for taking to sports games.There are color options to make it easier to find or suit your taste. Does not look like it is for kids.  Simple, elegant look.It is not the strongest. It is for lighter use or occasional replacement. Don't over-stuff it and expect it to last.That said for the price and the right purposes...it is perfect. Very useful to have one at home.Note: We were not compensated in any way for this unbiased review."
"I bought this I bought this mostly because of the low price.  We use this as a sports bag for kids. we got the first one when our child was a five year old girl and we wanted a bag for dance class and it has grown with her. She’s now eight and we have bought multiple of these bags so her and her brothers sports items for each activity so we don’t have to constantly shuffle stuff between bags for activitia.so we don’t have to constantly shuffle stuff between bags for activitiesImportant to note, these are completely soft, sided and soft bottom and there’s no plastic insert or anything that inherently keeps the bags shape to stand up on its own. important to note, these are completely soft sided and soft bottom and there’s no plastic insert. There are no interior or exterior pockets except for a mesh exterior. That doesn’t do a very good job of holding a water bottle because the pocket is too short but it’s great for storing a small item.there are no interior or exterior pockets except for a mesh exterior.

This little bag is great for the gym as well as for an overnight bag! I’m able to store my gym needs and it’s sturdy plus the material is thick. It’s also really cute!
"The PUMA Kids' Evercat Transformation Duffel Bag is adorable and great for kids! It’s a bit smaller than I was expecting for a duffel bag, but it’s the perfect size for little ones to carry their belongings.The design is cute and functional, and it’s just the right size for sleepovers, sports, or weekend trips. If you're looking for a kid-friendly duffel bag, this one works well!"
"Got this for my son and daughter it’s perfect for an overnight bag , great quality great value , storage capacity is best for kids things or you could fit one to two days of cloths for an adult if you really needed to and when your not using it it folds up nice and doesn’t take up space"
Great quality and perfect for a gym bag
Small and yet still spacious and also very fashionable
"Bought it for daughters swim practice. Small and roomy enough for her age! Wish there’s an inner pocket so she can separate her goggles and swim cap, but no big deal, using a ziplock now. Great value!"
Holds a lot and easy to carry for kids. Grandkids loved them
this is good for a kid but Good
I got this as a replacement for my daughter‚Äôs old string backpack and I like that the material has some durability to it and that the ‚Äòstrings‚Äô are thicker and soft so they don‚Äôt dig into your shoulders. The plain colors are perfect for school as is the zipper pocket in the front. Big enough to hold everything essential but small enough to carry from class to class.
I purchase these every year for a teen outreach program.  They are very sturdy and have a great color selection.
"I do A LOT OF MUSIC FESTIVALS, and these bags are perfect. They fit the size and pocket requirements for most Music Festivals, and it's not going to fall apart at the seems like the free-bee bags that you gets that look like these. These have thick ropes, and knots. Along with thick material and sewn sides. This is exactly what I was looking for, so I bought 3x for all my adventures."
"I wanted an inexpensive bag for carrying extra stuff on my ebike. This is a nice size, looks durable, and was a good value. There are fancier ones out there that might have more features but this one is certainly ok for occasional use. Will easily hold a raincoat, lightweight bike jacket, lunch, small bike tool kit.Not so much for camping or hiking where you need more stuff."
This is really a great little backpack. It‚Äôs canvas and it‚Äôs not nylon. So it‚Äôs more sturdy. Has a zipper on the front and the straps are good. I would recommend this item for errands and trips and whatever. Great for the beach too does not pick up sand or water. And I love the red color!
"so, the bag is great quality, it‚Äôs thick and seems durable, the strings are really nice, they look like they won‚Äôt get tangled or hurt you or break off easily. They fit my basketball shoes, they fit my change of clothes and i could probably fit in a refillable gatorade bottle in there and STILL have extra space to put something in there. I used to own a tiktok shop black drawstring bag and the holes to loop the strings would break and it would be a whole mess but this is definitely athlete‚Äôs approved! I recommend this bag, i bought this bc of the good reviews, free 2-day prime shipping and yeah. It‚Äôs great, better than buying a $25 nike drawstring bag. Sorry for the yap hope this helps."
Bag was better quality and large size than expected for the price.
This is an excellent bag to use with a wheelchair. It‚Äôs flexible you can hang it on the candles and it hangs perfectly away from the wheels. It‚Äôs sturdy. The rope straps are strong. It stays closed. Highly recommend.
"Been using it for over a month, took it various places, had lots of items in it and it still holds up very well."
I just love it. I'm putting it through hell and it holds up amazing.
This bag was super useful and worked great until 2 days in and a giant hole formed on the side of the bag. The seam from the bottom edge to the middle split. Luckily I spotted it before heading out for the day or all my items would have fallen out throughout the day.
Bag is very hard and shoulder straps are very soft and comfortable. It is good.
"It would be great if the back had a skeleton structure or something at the base to help it sit on the floor properly. It's just a flat piece of fabric with no shape, making it awkward to place on the floor as it tends to fall over randomly. Also, an exterior pocket for quick access to essential items would be useful."
"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this bag in person - I go away for work often and needed a bag to hold a week or two worth of clothes and toiletries. This bag has SURPASSED my expectations! Everything fits very well, there is a good sized pocket for shoes - I can put 2 pairs, there is a wet zipper pouch, the bag is well made, the option for carrying is AMAZING - Backpack, duffle bag, or handle bag, and the bag is really nice looking too! Performed well on two trips already and the different carrying options makes it easy to load! I will be ordering one for each of my sons for vacationing too!"
"Plenty room for shoes, shower shoes, towels, clothes, ect. I like to use this as a backpack  instead of duffle bag."
Excellent bag with a lot of useful pockets and storage areas. I like the build quality. Only downside is to be mindful of the size. I purchased the 40 oz bag and it’s smaller than I expected. I’m not sure if the size includes all the side pockets but it’s fairly small
The bag was a little too big for what I imagined it to be. But other than that it is a really good bag.
Dimensions are as described. Quality is great. Most people use this for a weekend or gym bag. I plan to use it for a 5 day trip and so far am able to fit the necessities for that long of a trip. Nothing extra. Love the backpack or duffel option. Use as a carry on no issues.
Fits alot and multiple carrying options
"I bought this duffle bag expecting to upgrade from my old one. Received the product and the backpack clips did not clip together. Requested a replacement and they sent me the same thing but half the size, basically child size. Not worth the hassle buying this product because they clearly have no quality control. Terrible manufacturing, waste of money. Not to mention my old beat up bag fits more than this brand new one which is LARGER in size. Not worth the money."
Purchased as a father day gift for my hubby who is getting back into the gym life.He absolutely loves this bag! It has so many useful components. He is able to carry size 13 shoes in the shoe compartment. A microfiber towels a change of clothing size XL (so the don't fold up small) his Chromebook laptop + charger & mouse.In the smaller zipper waterproof pouch he carries full stick Deoderant small shampoo bottle and a full bar of soap.He has a place for his phone and a 32oz water bottle! TThe bag has a side zipper pouch that he is able to fit 2 large bottles of vitamins plus his lunch in!He uses it for short overnight trips but mostly the gym.It is a fantastic bag! He loves the versatility and the fact that he has the option to Cary it as a backpack or over his shoulder!Highly recommended 👌  no issues with seams hoping or bag tearing so far and he has over stuffed it for a week long trip!
"Love this bag. It has a compartment for just about everything and the design is amazing. I have had bags with “shoe compartments” before but I have a bit above average sized shoes and usually they never fit. This bag comes in and I come to find out they added an extension zipper for the shoe compartment and finally I have a bag that actually fits my shoes. The bag itself looks better in real life than in the pictures (rare for Amazon products). It is super lightweight yet very durable, so far it’s the best gym/ travel bag I have owned.Update: the only thing that could use improvement is the zipper quality. They get stuck a lot and seem like they won’t last very long. Other than that it’s a great bag"
"I’m don’t write reviews unless I really like or dislike something. Used it for a couple of weeks. This bag is high quality, the stitching is firm, the compartments and zippers are ideal for keeping things organized and it’s just really nice and different. I had an Adidas bag that fell apart. Very much recommend this bag for the price."
Needed a new GYM bag and this works great. Love the expansion feature and all the space.
This gym bag has lived up to what has been described it is a very durable bag and looks great!
This duffle bag/backpack is heavy-duty. The material feels like it will be durable and has multiple ways to carry it. The bag is already hefty without any items in so I can see this becoming super heavy. I like all the zippered pockets and the small travel bag.
"Very nice gym bag, it’s padded with tons of compartments to stay organized! Seems well made and love hot it expands if I need extra space!"
"The pockets, design, straps and space is excellent. The velcro for Personalization in places to put hooks are great. I.Am worried about how long the zippers are gonna last one.Already broke where the zipper doesn't properly stay. With one already going worried how the rest are going to do especially with it being on the main pocket for the bag. Would have let another direction if I knew it would have broke this early.Otherwise a great bag."
"I love its functionality, I’ve ordered several other gym bags but they all came short. This one was definitely worth kissing so many frogs until I found the right one."
I like my new gym bag. It has a separate pocket if I decide to swim. Wet and dry compartments. Pretty cool. Also fits perfectly in the gym locker. Great bag.
Been using this bag for almost two years now. Maintain the bag when using and it'll last you longer than you think. Great material quality. Hope this helps.
"My husband loves this bag. He uses it for the gym, but it could be used for traveling or anything else. It holds all of his stuff and even has a special spot for shoes so that they don’t touch anything else."
"I use this for softball, the gym and overall light travel. This bag is durable, high quality, and very nice. Brings back my military vibes but doesn't fall apart like Mil-Spec! Definitely grab it."
"The bag construction is a thick sturdy fabric with Molle straps all over the outside which makes attaching other gym items to the outside convenient. Side shoe compartment which can be collapsed from the inside for max internal storage capacity. Front zipper pocket small items, right side mesh pocket which is good enough to carry your water/protein bottle and two internal pockets (i) open pocket (ii) zippered pocket.SUGGESTIONS For Improvement which would score 5-star rating1) Add 1 inch full zip pocket to the right side (before the mesh pocket)2) Inside open pocket, expand width and make into two compartments"
"Needed a bag for a two week work trip that wasn't a Sea Bag. Straps are strong, good pockets. I love how it has a separate pouch for shoes, etc. That you can not use if you want and it's seamless!"
"I use the back for my work clothes after I do PT in the morning. I live too far from work to go workout and come back and shower. I bring all my stuff and the bag is perfect size, with the perfect amount of pockets. The shoe compartment to keep my shoes and clothes separate and why I bought this. Perfect."
"I needed a good bag to replace my other gym bag. I thought, TACTICAL b/c I love molle. And I do have extra velcro patches. Good price.Strong build. I had a buncha tools in it, maybe 20 pounds. Fine and sturdy. Didn't even realize it had the shoe portion aka 2A and 420 compartment. It's a thin separation so it can get out the way."
"I bought this bag to modify and fit as something to keep on my bike. This bag is very durable and can fit so much inside it. Survives through all weather. I fully load this bf with tools, medical equipment, etc. Quality buikd is amazing. Strongly recommend. Just wish it was waterproof. But it takes a long time for it to get wet inside while raining"
"The bag's quality is superb, it's sturdy, highly functional, particularly for shoes, and most importantly, its design is excellent.It's been a while since I've been so pleased with a product on Amazon."
"I'm a student who practically lives out of my backpack, carrying everything from textbooks and laptops to food, clothes, and even a mini medical kit. Finding a bag that can handle it all was a challenge, but this bag can do it!!Here's the good:- Dual Functionality: It seamlessly transitions from a spacious duffle bag to a comfortable backpack, making it perfect for any situation.- Padded Straps: Unlike some duffle-backpack hybrids, this one has well-padded straps that make even the heaviest loads feel manageable.- Ample Storage: This bag is seriously roomy! I can easily fit my 15-inch MacBook, food, headphones, daily essentials, medical kit, shoes, and a change of clothes without it feeling crammed.- Durable Construction: The material feels sturdy and well-made, giving me confidence that it will last for years to come + water resistant up to a certain level. It gives a good cover for my stuff when I'm caught out in the rain.Minor Concerns:Carabiner Connection: While the carabiner connection at the bottom seems secure so far, I can't help but worry about its long-term durability. Hopefully, it proves to be as reliable as the rest of the bag.Past Experience: I bought a similar, black color, backpack a while ago. However, it's zipper had broken within a year. Regardless, I found that I still wanted it so I decided to take extra care when I'm using the zipper. I think I just happened to overload it previously.Overall:Despite my minor concern about the carabiner, this bag has exceeded my expectations. It's comfortable, spacious, and versatile, making it the perfect companion for my busy student life. I even used it for a weekend trip recently, proving its adaptability beyond everyday use.Value for Money:This bag is definitely worth every penny. It was for me. While I wish they offered a warranty (especially considering my previous bag's zipper issue), the value it provides in terms of functionality, durability, and comfort outweighs that minor inconvenience. I'm confident I'll be using this bag for years to come!Highly Recommend:If you're looking for a duffle-backpack hybrid that can handle your day-to-day needs and even weekend adventures, look no further! This bag is an absolute steal and I highly recommend it to students and travelers alike."
"I absolutely love love this bag period durable waterproof and tons of storage.Not to mention, these drops are comfortable when you put it in backpack mode. The quality of the product is excellent. The zippers actually have seams over the top of them, so they don't catch or snag on anything"
Very spacious. I wish the wet bag was larger. It's very good quality. The zippers are nice and thick. I love that there's more than one way to carry it and it's not complicated to switch from one way to the other.
"Pros: good amount of room, versatile carrying optionsCons: water bottle pocket too small, some pockets too narrow, could use more interior organization.Wanted a big enough bag that I wouldn't need to move items in or out depending on what I'm doing - I'm able to fit my weightlifting, climbing, and swimming gear in this bag all at the same time. Though it's roomy, IMO the bag has the bare minimum required to be functional in terms of organization. The layout of interior pockets/external dividers is sufficient, but I would have liked additional internal pockets or perhaps one of the bigger pockets split into two.The bag itself feels fairly durable in terms of construction - the fabric feels thick enough to withstand constant use and all the stitching/attachment points seem solid.This bag's biggest flaw is that the water bottle pockets are not the same size. I use a 40oz stainless steel vacuum bottle, and it only fits in one of the pockets (the one used when in backpack mode). If I want to carry this bottle in duffel bag mode, I need to either shove it inside the main compartment where it takes up space or strap it in sideways in the 'backpack mode' pocket with an external strap - both solutions that I can live with, but find annoying.I do also wish that some of the pockets (particularly the external pocket on the back of the bag) were a bit wider - if I try to put anything too thick in there it causes the pocket to bulge and makes closing the zipper difficult.There was a surprising amount of room in the bag - I'm able to fit all of the following at the same time, which in my opinion fills the bag to about 90% capacity:- Two chalk bags- Weightlifting shoes- Climbing shoes- Thin hand towel- Regular size bath towel- Weightlifting belt (velcro style)- Two pairs of knee sleeves- One pair each of knee wraps, wrist wraps, and wrist straps- One roll of athletic tape- Small bottle of liquid chalk- Swim trunks- Swim cap- Goggles- 40oz water bottle- Small misc. items like extra contacts, lotion, a headband, etc.One small issue when I first got the bag - one of the clips on the detachable shoulder strap was sticking when I opened it instead of springing closed. After about 5 minutes of forcefully opening/closing the clip I managed to clear out whatever obstruction was causing the issue and the clip mostly functions fine now unless I push the clip open with a good amount of force.Overall, this bag seems solid and meets almost all of my needs. A couple of tweaks would have made it perfect, but I suspect this is as close as any bag will get."
"I’ve had this bag for over 6 months and it’s hands down the best gym bag I’ve had. So many pockets and compartments, I always have a spot to put things. Love the shoe pocket, if I don’t have my shower shoes in there, it’s great for putting dirty clothes in since it is separated from everything else in the bag. Its quality and finish is great, I toss it around and it does not even have a scratch. No zippers have broken. Love that it turns into a backpack as well, also making it a great travel bag.I rarely leave reviews but one of the straps broke and I messaged the seller if I could get a replacement and they sent it no problem! So I figured I had to leave a review for the awesome customer service!"
"After extensive research, I finally settled on purchasing this gym bag, and I must say that I am thoroughly satisfied with my decision. The quality of this bag is exceptional, and it offers ample storage space, allowing you to effortlessly fit all your essentials. Despite its generous capacity, the bag maintains a compact exterior, especially when utilizing it as a backpack, making transportation remarkably convenient. Alternatively, the included strap provides another versatile carrying option.Furthermore, this gym bag is impressively lightweight, ensuring ease of use and portability. It even features a dedicated compartment for storing shoes, further enhancing its functionality. Notably, the bag's stylish design adds a fashionable touch to your gym attire.Overall, I highly recommend this gym bag, as it surpasses expectations in terms of quality, functionality, and style. Considering its reasonable price, it undoubtedly represents the best gym bag I have ever owned. It is a worthwhile investment that will undoubtedly enhance your gym-going experience."
Wonderful and efficient bag for daily use.
"Over all bag is good, But it should have better quality handle"
"First impressions.  This is a great value bag, the clincher for me are the shoulder straps so I can carry the bag whilst riding to the gym.  The compartments at each end are very useful and it is just big enough for a change of clothes, towel, toiletries etc.  it seems well made, looks good  - I chose green- and it has no logos which is a bonus for me."
"This bag is very inexpensive but well designed. It has lots of pockets, the shoe pocket works great but what I was surprised to love best about it was the small extra bag that comes with it.  It's such a perfect size to hold phone, keys, earbuds and couple of things I need in the gym (cable ankle strap, resistance band, face towel) that I haven't taken the full bag into the gym yet!  This was a great purchase, highly recommended!"
I love this gym bag I‚Äôve had it for about 3 months it‚Äôs perfect. Many compartments for me to separate my gym gear. Very sturdy and I love the yoga mat place holder. Wish it had a shoulder strap thou.
I've had this for a couple of months. I take it to my Pilates and Yoga classes 5 days a week.  It still looks good. Holds up nice. Is not dirty. The water bottle pouch is so convenient.  My 32 oz canteen fits in it perfectly. It has gotten a little dirty though. Still worth the purchase.
"I have finally found the ultimate gym bag solution with this gem that includes a convenient water bottle bag. Let me tell you, this bag has truly exceeded my expectations in every aspect :) ‚ù§Ô∏è The quality of this bag is good, I have no doubt that this bag will stand the test of time, no matter where I go. What sets this bag apart is its thoughtful design with multiple compartments. I can effortlessly organize all my gym essentials, and the dedicated slot for my iPhone 16pro (for reference) is just the cherry on top. Knowing that my phone is safe and easily accessible adds an extra layer of convenience to my workouts.But what really puts a smile on my face is the versatility of this bag. It seamlessly transitions from the gym to travel. Its stylish yet functional design makes it a perfect companion for all my activities, bringing both practicality and flair to my daily routine. In conclusion, this gym bag has become an indispensable part of my active lifestyle. If you are looking for a reliable, well-crafted bag that can keep up with your diverse needs, look no further. I wholeheartedly recommend this bag to anyone seeking a blend of quality, style, and functionality in their everyday carry."
"best gym bag ive ever had , it has so many compartments and is spacious yet not overly huge and is super fun to carry around. The price is great for the product!"
Very nice quality and stylish
I got this gym bag because my old one was ugly and barely held anything. This bag is very cute and it holds a lot! There are so many compartments and storage areas to hold many different things. There is even a yoga mat strap for you to hold your yoga mat. The only thing I wish with that was that you were able to take it off if you‚Äôre not putting a yoga mat there because it kind of gets in the way. Other than that it‚Äôs a great bag and it‚Äôs very easy to take anywhere because it doesn‚Äôt take up that much space. Not to mention it comes with a water bottle satchel with a zipper pocket on it if you just want to take your water bottle!
i use tis bag to hold all of my gym supplies and it‚Äôs terrific!! i also took it on a trip and used it as my carry on. if fit very nicely on my suitcase ! it holds plenty!!
