It came with a ton of accessories that are useful and well labelled.  The colour coding helps get you what you need quickly.  The guide was helpful without being overbearing..  Lots of power compared to my last razor.
"I'm really pleased with my purchase. Considering the price, it was more than I was expecting. The only thing I can complain about is that it's not very sharp for lines cut around my son's hair, but it's still pretty good."
"I am 50+ years old with ethnically mixed hair.  I use this ChI 44, almost exclusively on my bang.  No matter how else I am wearing my hair, I am always stuck with the bang my brother ""helped"" me cut, when I was 5 years old.  And with my hair texture, frizz, just frizz.  It used to just either be puffy BIG BANG frizzy, or tight and drawn up frizz.  SO, now that I found this, if I go out of the house I use it.  It protects my hair from the heat & definitely helps it, to straighten in one flat iron pass .  I have also, since I began using this about 6-7 years ago, been able to turn way down both my flat iron, and curling wand temperature.  I spray some on my bang, comb through, hit it with some heat to detangle; then after it is straight i put a bit more CHI 44, in my hands(this is why the pump was helpful) & lightly apply to my bang.  I pull my wand or flat iron through again, this time I curl it under, like a Bob, and I then turn it under; and immediately unplug the device, hold it curled, for however long my arthritic shoulder will let me, then toss it into a large open roller.  Lastly, if possible, and as quickly as I can I blast it with cool air (usually the car A/C because I am usually doing this on the way to the doctors, or wherever I am going).  Then I leave the curler in till I get where I am going, but 10 minutes usually does the trick.  Even as i am typing this, i can't believe after all these years of hair struggles, I have what can be called a system or a routine.  I have medical limitations, so I don't do my hair to leave the house every day.  So, routing doesn't quite fit.  This works better than anything ever has.  When I am able to do steps using the CHI 44 guard, heat, and a curler, my bang drops from the curler & it is ""fresh blowout bouncy"".  I am also sure it helps fight humidity etc. So, I am giving it 5 stars.  With me health, and medications, I am always hot and humid and eventually my hair does frizz.  But with age, I have come to realize, that for me, I care far more about my appearance upon my entrance then my departure.  I do not think people pay as much attention to my flaws, as I worry about.  And if they do, it's probably within the first few minutes of seeing me.  So having a good bang entrance has really pleased me.  Now I like i can throw the rest of the birds nest I call hair into a ponytail and get to enjoying a day out of the house.  Lastly the smell, i am very sensitive to smells.  This smells like ""heat protection"" it has the smell a good thermal protection shampoo or conditioner has.  Not pleasant, but not sickening.  Also, it does not linger.  If it stayed I would not recommend it, but it fades quickly.  My husband however did comment a few times in the closed car.  I usually spray it before I leave the house, then heat straighten it, in the car etc.  So, it is when I go to spray the tiny bit on my hands, before curling it under, that it bothers him.  That is why I got a pump to try.  It seems to work as well as the aerosol version, with the added benefit, that one quick pump into my hand doesn't fill the car with the scent the way aerosolizing it does/.  I like having both pump and can.  Recently, I started using a few spritzes from the hairline back a few inches into my pulled back hair.  I hadn't tried this, in all the years since i found it, because i have neck problems, I am hesitant to use any kind of holding products for fear of having difficulty washing them out.  This has not been a problem, leaves no flaking residue behind.  And it does keep my ponytail neat.  The can is quicker for this, but the pump works the same.  I have used the iron guard with assistance, to help when straightening my whole head after shampoo. It was great.  But, I have not tried this with the pump.  I will update if I do.  This product has helped me so much, I will keep eye out for any questions about it, that i can answer.  Good luck if you are trying it for the first time."
"Smells GREAT! Helps reduce heat damage for hair straightener, curling iron and blow drying. High quality spray essy to use bottle, makes hair soft and shiny. If you have damaged hair or put heater to your hair, you NEED this spray."
A nice heat protectant- I don‚Äôt like how it sprays onto my hair so I sprayed it into my hand and then palm it through my hair and combs through. It‚Äôs not sticky. It‚Äôs not heavy. It‚Äôs not tacky. I don‚Äôt mind the scent. I use it when I straighten or curl my hair and my hair always has a nice smooth texture and looks shiny
"Since I‚Äôve been using this, I‚Äôve noticed less damage in my hair! I use heat frequently and needed something heavy duty to protect my hair. A lot of heat protectants I‚Äôve used have made my hair greasy, but I don‚Äôt have that problem with this one!I‚Äôm not super fond of the texture of this spray- it‚Äôs akin to hairspray. It makes your hair sort of stiff and weighty, but after a quick brush-through, it‚Äôs mostly fine. It‚Äôs just sort of strange.The scent is fine. It‚Äôs not bad, it just smells like any other hair product, a bit chemically.Apart from a few little gripes, it‚Äôs definitely helped my hair and has become a regular product in my hair routine!"
"I love chi iron guard. It works so good with my flat iron. It leaves some shine behind as well. And the smell, omg, it‚Äôs amazing. I love this stuff!!"
"I really love this heat protectant because of how well it protects my hair, but it leaves behind a very sticky residue to my hair that makes it super tough. Keeps the hold of my styling and makes it mostly straight but I can't run my hands through my hair whatsoever."
"Perfect for medium thick, dry, curly hair. Spray it on dry hair. It smooths it great with a hot straightening brush and takes away frizz and lasts a few days. Depending on your hair, you might need a spray shiner. I also use a leave in conditioner after shower on wet hair. Then dry my hair. Then spray this on, right before using hot tool."
"I have 3B curls-very fine, porous hair. This is the best heat spray I've used. It's not oily, and leaves hair voluminous, but not frizzy. It also has a pleasant ""salon"" smell. I've tried other heat sprays but always come back to this one."
I wasn't sure if I wanted to purchase this as I am very picky with smells if I don't know what I'm buying but am I ever glad I got this one my frizzy hair comes right straight it works great!! And omg the smell is so so nice! Highly recommend üëå
It does protect my hair from iron heat
"This beach hair tool is a game-changer for anyone looking to achieve effortless, sun-kissed waves without the hassle. Compact and easy to use, a good beach hair tool is a must for anyone who wants that relaxed, vacation-ready look year-round."
"So my natural hair is curly wavy and straight in all the wrong places. It's frizzy and just not cooperative.  Straightening my hair took me forever and always looked flat but nice but dead. I bought this too see if it would make my get ready faster because Straightening my hair everyday took an hour. All I have to say is WOW!!!!!!! Less than 10 mins I was out the door. Let the pictures speak for itself. After whole day the waves looked honestly even better, like perfect loose beach waves. I don't like to spend time on make up and hair, nor do I really know how. But this is my must have now, I fell in love with my hair again."
"it preforms well and you get good results, nice waves and no crimps however the part you put your thumb on for the clamp gets super super hot over time & even the glove doesnt really help with that. besides that its easy to use , light weight and hasnt broken!"
"This was an impulse buy and I love it. Heats up nicely and creates lovely waves. I did not need to use the heat glove that came with iron. I did use a heat spray prior to iron. I have naturally wavy, thick hair. This photo was taken after I had straightened my hair a few days prior."
"It’s really big and bulky so if you don’t mind that, then this is for you. It’s really heavy, but it crimps really quickly : so it’s definitely some thing that I would use if I didn’t mind the bulkiness of it. The heat gets really hot and almost burns the plastic off of it so instead of it being pink it turns black like the pictures in the reviews show! I returned it just because it’s super heavy and big and in the way and just not something that I prefer to use!"
Works well ! Easy to use!
this is great quality for the price and super easy to use. it’s the same size as most hot tools so it fits in a drawer nicely
"I have medium length and stubborn hair. However, this waver has passed all expectations, and impressed me with how well it waves my hair. In the image, those waves are 3 days old, so they last a long time. In more detail, freshly waved hair is so PRETTY!! The waves stay in good! I got a lot of compliments and I felt amazing in the hair. Though, there are only two temperatures to choose from, so I fear that if you have hair that can’t tolerate high heat, this waver will damage your hair a lot. Just make sure you use heat protectant/serum! I recommend Mise En Scene Styling Serum, it protects your hair and gives your hair SHINE! Even more, this was my first time using this type of styling tool, so the design was a little bulky, but my hands got used to it in no time. Also, the first time I used this tool, I took about 30ish minutes to do all of my hair. Overall, spectacular product!!!"
"Recommended to me by a friend. So simple to use, no technique or skill needed.It turns out great every time!"
"I've been using this hair waver frequently, and overall, it does a great job creating the waves I want. It includes two heat settings—356°F and 410°F—which work well for me, but they might not be ideal for everyone. If you prefer more control over the heat settings, this could be a limitation. Additionally, it took a bit of getting used to during the first few tries, but once you get the hang of it, it's reliable and easy to use. Despite these minor drawbacks, it has become a regular part of my hair routine!"
"Really like the results this hair tool gives. It takes a little getting used to since it’s quite big compared to a curling iron, but works really well. Very satisfied with my purchase and the beautiful mermaid hair it gives me"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I have not found a hair straightener that has suited me yet after many years of trying various kinds including those that are cheaper and more expensive. I bought this on a whim before a trip because it was listed as a dual voltage product. I have had a good experience with my hot tools, hairdryer brush in the past and so felt that this would be worth a try. I took it on a work trip and was totally shocked and impressed by how hot the tool got and how smooth it felt on my hair, which is wavy/frizzy/East Indian hair. I hate straightening my hair usually because I always experience hair pull, no matter what type of hair straightener I use whether it’s ceramic or titanium. This straightener was extremely smooth to use and required one to two passes for extremely straight hair that lasted. My hair was also quite shiny and smooth. The product heated up very quickly and has a nice digital display and heats up to 455° which is beyond what most of my other straighteners go up to. It has an indicator light to let you know that the product is ready to use, and it also has an auto shut off, although it will stay on for quite a long time without turning off up to two hours, I believe… I also attempted to use the flat iron to give my hair a slight curl one day and I was able to do this quite easily even though I am almost never able to manage, curling my hair with a flat iron with other tools that I’ve had… I don’t feel satisfied with many hair tools, but was happily surprised with this one and felt that I needed to leave a review as various good reviews helped me choose this product quickly… I used this product while abroad in Europe with a simple travel adapter and it worked beautifully. It does get hot near the plates and you have to be careful when you are holding the flat iron too close to the plates but they do include a heat resistant glove with the product, I just don’t typically use it.I recommend this product, although I cannot speak to the longevity of it as I’ve only been using it for a little over a week. I do have a good experience with hot tools and I’m hopeful that I just saved myself a lot of money investing in a more expensive product because this one is fantastic.One other thing as a bonus is that there is a lock to keep the hair straightener plates closed, which is a nice change from my old one that stays open unless covered with a plastic cover piece.I purchased the 1 1/4 inch product"
"I haven’t gotten a new straightener in like 10 years. When I tell you the DIFFERENCE in this one and my old one… 😮‍💨First off, it has a very sheek design and the black color is nice. I like the round barrel to potentially use this to curl as well as straighten. I also love that this does not snag my hair while straightening (unlike my old one). The straightener itself is lightweight and easy to store since it is not bulky.The speed with which this heated up is INSANE!!! Less than 10 seconds and it was at 395 degrees!!! My old one took at least 10 minutes to get hot.I bought this at a discounted price for cyber monday and it is well worth the money. It straightens my hair quickly to pin straight and instantly removes frizz. I am in love!"
"My stylist recommended this & it works great. Hair glides thru, heats up quick & easy to use.  Glove isn't great as heat protector."
These flat irons are absolutely my favorite. They work really well. They get nice and hot. It’s worth the price. It doesn’t damage my hair like other flat irons it grips the hair well. It leaves my thick hair with a beautiful bounce and shine to it.
"I love that this tool is curved or rounded. It is so easy to curl my hair with it! I’m not a pro by any means but I curl my hair faster with this than I do a beachwaver, I also feel like it’s easier with this tool. I have a very good grip on it, and the temperature on it is just immaculate. It heats up very quickly and is easy to operate. I love that it spins with you while you’re curling your hair. My hair is not frizzy and it doesn’t feel fried after I use this tool either. Over all the quality is amazing, and I have dropped it a couple of times and it’s not even scratched! I highly recommend this product."
"I was considering ordering this on the hot tools website with the limited lifetime warranty, but for half the price I decided to get it on Amazon. Although I just got it and only used it once so far, I'm pleased. I can't believe how fast it heats up! I have not bought a new straightener in almost 10 years so I'm used to much older technology. I genuinely can't believe how fast this heated. It's nothing too fancy, has a range of heat settings and is comfortable to hold. I went from a 1.5"" plate to this 1"" plate but this works well, heats well, and for the price it can't be beat. Curls well, I'm just struggling to get it to hold the wave technique. I feel like with my thinner blonde hair and the level of heat it should hold more and make more dramatic dents in the hair, but overall it works great for the price."
I’ve been searching for a good hair iron for a while. It was recommended by my hair stylist. The heat controls are very good with a sound sensor to indicate the iron is heated to desired temperature. Great value. The brand is great for all hair tools. Easy to hold in the hand. Not too heavy or thick. Makes my hair sleek and does not burn. I appreciate the heat protection glove included with the product.
This is the best hair straightener I’ve owned in a while!! I’ve gotten so many compliments about my hair. It heats up so fast and it even straighten my annoying postpartum hair. Definitely recommend!
"I purchased the HOT TOOLS Professional Black Gold Micro-Shine Flat Iron and it is truly Professional! I have thick, course hair and it straightens and curls my hair quickly!  This flat iron heats up in seconds and my hairstyle holds for days."
"Looooved it, my hair is very thin and this one suits my hair very well, my hair doesn’t stick anymore"
Heats up very fast and really efficient at straightening my flyaways/curls.
"Lovely,all in one,very effective,heats quickly,durable,value for money.I would recommend"
I bought for my teenage granddaughter. She loves it.  Said it was easy to use. Price and quality great.
This does work well! Love that I can change the barrels however be careful leaving it plugged in as it can be turned on very easily. Mine fell off my counter and in the process turned on and left a burn mark on my floor. It was caught before anything serious like a fire could happen unfortunately for my husband it was his bare foot that found it. Now it gets unplugged after use and put in a vented hanging metal holder to cool.
This is the perfect curling wand if you like to switch it up everyone and then. (The sizes of your curls) one thing I do recommend tho is investing into some selves to go with it bc the wand gets supper hot and burns within seconds of a tap to ur skinüòÇü§ûüèªother than that I love it!üòÇü§ûüèª
Birthday gift for my sister. It heats fast.. doesn‚Äôt burn hands and comes with multiple options.. had to buy a second one for myself
"okay i don‚Äôt usually review stuff but i wanted to say something about this curler. i love this thing so much, its so much easier to buy this thing rather than a whole bunch of different curlers. my hair doesn‚Äôt usually take heat really well and it just doesn‚Äôt hold a curl, however this curler worked really well for me. i‚Äôve seen some people say that the leg pops out sometimes, but if you hear a click when it pops in it won‚Äôt fall out. i really recommend this and it‚Äôs so worth the price!!"
"I‚Äôve never written a review but if I can help at least one person, this is so worth it. I had curled my hair and shut the iron off, a couple minutes later I heard some popping noises and sparks flying. I look over and apparently the cord was sitting too close to the iron, and literally caught on fire. Burned the rug, the mat is was sitting on as well. Literally went up in flames. I had tried so many times to fix the cord from being all coiled up but could never get it to lay flat. Thank god I was home when this happened and took the appropriate action otherwise idk if I would still have a house."
"I bought this 6 months ago. Initially I really enjoyed the quality and versatility and ease of switching out the tools. However, as time has gone on, it causes weird smelling hair. Even with proper use partnered with thermal protectant hair products. Also, multiple times the 3 barrel waver attachment has detached from the handle while using which results in pain as it‚Äôs caught in my hair along with having to snap it back in - the tool has bent and is now not usable. It‚Äôs unsafe. I‚Äôm beyond my return window or else I‚Äôd be returning for a full refund. Very disappointed given the cost."
Amazing product.  Looks totally expensive and high quality.  Boxed up beautifully and all attachments are of high standard.  Not cheap at all.  Fast heating time. All attachments fit well into barrel.  Lovely colour too. You don't need to spend more.  Easy passes as an expensive high end hair curler. All the sizes are a bonus too. Glove is essential.  Wasn't sure if to buy this but I was happily surprised
These are perfect. My daughter loves to pick out which ones she wants it makes doing her hair more exciting. Now that we can finally do things with her hair these are the way to go!
"I ONLY use the clear ones and I’ve had this since Feb 2024 (it is not Oct 2024) & I’m not even halfway through the clear ones. Next time I’ll only buy the clear ones. I use at least 6 a day too. So it’s not like I’m using 1 or 2 a day. Love these!  The black ones have more stretch to them. It takes more to wrap them around the hair. That’s the only problem I have with the black. Which, may not even be a problem for someone else. But I have a squirmy toddler and can’t be fighting with a rubber band lol."
Works great
I have super thick hair and sometimes certain bands would snap. These hold ALL day! Sometimes they snap when I go to use them but once they are in they stay!
Does exactly what it needs!
"Although there are so many, they tend to get stuck to each other. They hold pretty well in the hair, but almost glue together to the point that taking them off is a hassle. Using the blade they provide is helpful, but it also cuts off some hair. Use with discretion."
I absolutely love this set and everything included on it
I bought two bottles during Prime Day. I wasn't expecting a lot because my hair is thin and is not easy to maintain. I was very pleasantly surprised at the results! My hair is so soft! It's shiny and I don't have to wash it as often as I used to. I'm 63 and have blonde hair. The spray is a fine mist and not oily.
The last thermal protector I had was from Tresemme. This one is SO MUCH BETTER! It makes my hair nice and shiny after blow drying while also taming flyaways and frizz. It also smells so good! My hair also isn't weighed down or left greasy after using this project. I will definitely repurchase.
I really like this product. Great for blow drying - makes your hair super soft. Very shiny.
"Works well with my heated brush, but very small bottle for the price. Besides being very costly, I love the product."
"This product is everything L'ange and it's social media influencers claim it to be. My blow out hairdrying brush went through every strand of my hair like butter. My hair is not weighed down, it is shiny, it definitely has a weightless feel. My only complaint is that it smells a bit like wasp spray, I hate to say that, because it is an awesome product, but once I dried my hair I could only smell my shampoo. I will definitely buy this product again though, smell or not, it is amazing."
The product works great on my hair but the smell is awful.  It's so overwhelming I have to leave the room for a good 20 mins after using it.  I think the smell is just terrible.
this has been the best heat protectant spray i have ever found. I have thick curly course hair and this by far makes my hair shiny and silky feeling. I cannot believe the fly aways and frizz is at an all time minimum when using this compared to other products. Highly recommend !!!
"This project is magical and I‚Äôm obsessed. I hope they never stop making it. I‚Äôve tried 1 million hair products and there‚Äôs nothing I would rave about this product and my hair has never looked better. I‚Äôm not sure how it works. I put it on damp hair and blow dry. My styles are smooth and fresh looking like I went to a salon. I use it the next day on dry hair to refresh my bangs and ends with wonderful results. If you were skeptical by this product, it is seriously life-changing. I liked it so much. I gave some to a girlfriend and three days later she texted me saying she was obsessed and doesn‚Äôt know how she‚Äôs lived this long without it. Because of my utter amazement of this product , I am now purchasing a handful of other products that this line makes. I‚Äôm hopeful they are half as good as the blowout primer. Fabulous fabulous fabulous product!! You will thank me later‚Ä¶"
"This product is awesome!  My hair is silky soft. Frizz is gone, shiny and it doesn‚Äôt weigh your hair down !"
Glasse makes my hair smooth and shiny when I blow dry it. My hair is usually frizzy and dull. A little goes a long way. I always have my cupboard stocked with it.
"This product is a game changer for me.  I have fine, curly hair and when I straighten it, it's always frizzy.  Trying the Glass Hair Primer has tamed my frizz!  I have tried so many products and I'm really pleased I found this one!  I will be a repeat buyer!"
Makes your hair completely soft without any frizz at all!Just like in a hair salon!
"First time I have used this Lange product, I love it!! Goes in nice and light and it makes your hair so nice and shiny, will buy this again!"
"I never thought I would say this, but it is worth every penny. It is super expensive, but man does my hair look great. It‚Äôs healthier and the style last longer than when I use other devices. I am very inept at styling my own hair. This has made it very easy for me to get to salon quality results. I found it easy to learn how to use the device. The noise level is great. It‚Äôs less noisy than a hairdryer and it drys my hair so dang quick. I love it!"
"If you will take it abroad, keep in mind that it will not work in a 220V country. Finding a voltage /wattage converter for a 1300W equipment is not an easy task, it is likely that the converter will be huge in size and will cost you half the price of the Dyson Airwrap itself."
"Bought on Oct 7, 2024 and received it same day via prime shipping.  Bought through Amazon and not a third party seller.  I am freaking out.  This product cost me nearly $640 (including taxes).  It was a gift to my partner and was a list minute surprise.  We are both in shocked that the ‚Äúnew‚Äù airwrap was NOT WORKING.  I was skeptical about some of the reviews.  Some stating it came used or it will blink and you have to clean the filter and it will continue to work.  That wasn‚Äôt the case for us.  A new product should have worked right away without issues.  When turning the device on, it will make a slight noise for two seconds then flash.  Tired multiple times turning off/on, changing plug ports, cleaning the filter at the bottom of the handle, letting it on for a while‚Ä¶. Nothing.  Seems like many people are having the same problem.  I had to return it post office quickly.  I hope Amazon/Dyson will not have any issues giving us a full refund.  Now we decided to stay away from Dyson products.  Quality has gone down hill."
I considered the Dyson Airwrap for a couple of years and finally chose to buy through Amazon for ease in returning if needed.  BUT- wow this tool is simply in a class by itself.  I have medium length hair and use all the attachments.  It does exactly what it claims- and is so efficient and works so well I can't imagine using the three hair tools I have for years again.  It is costly- but worth it.
"FYI -  if you have a cosmetology license you can purchase directly from Dyson with an $150 trade discount.I learned about the Dyson Stick after discussing my woes about how I‚Äôd dry my waist length hair while wearing a cast on my hand for 7 weeks post surgery. She lent me her Dyson as the attachable brush allowed me to dry/style my hair with one hand! What a game changer. It also dries the hair much quicker than my current professional dryer, while sealing the cuticle ‚Äî leaving it very smooth looking and soft feeling. While the dryer has a high price tag for non stylists, it‚Äôs only slightly higher priced than what I‚Äôd normally spend on a professional high speed, well balanced, powerful dryer. Hopefully, the motor on the Dyson is comparable to my other dryers ‚Äî in quality and longevity.Con ‚Äî the case it comes in. While pretty looking,  it‚Äôs useless. When I order my dryer, I‚Äôll purchases a cloth caddy that can attach to a wall with adhesive for storage and easy access!  It IS easy to travel with - as it takes up minimal space.The limited edition dark blue color dryer is only offered at a few select department stores. Long story short ‚Äî I highly recommend the Dyson Stick!"
"This product is amazing.  I haven't even tried all the attachments, I just love the rocking brush attachment.  It's been a game changer.  It is so quick to do my hair in the morning, and it is so straight and smooth.  I love it.  Am so happy.  I also tried the Shark version of this, but the motor was too high pitched for my ears.  This one is still loud and high-pitched, but not as bad."
"It cuts drying time in half and leaves hair shiny, smooth & styled. Only complaint is the size of the entire package"
