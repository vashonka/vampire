"******UPDATE******Company sent the replacement puzzle quickly..received it in the mail yesterday. WOULD HIGHLY recommend this company. Their puzzles are fun and challenging and they take customer service seriously!!After contacting the company, they said they will send me another puzzle. I'll let you know if it arrives.Although I truly enjoyed the puzzle and the challenge it was, I was sad to find out there were 2 missing pieces at the bottom border. I was unable to do the puzzle before a lot of time passed since my purchase in August of last year, but wanted to let consumers know to know of my experience."
"We do a lot of puzzles and this was our favorite. This same picture is produced by many manufacturers. The quality of this was high with a great price/value. What made it great was it was a nice scenic picture with a variety of diverse colors and puzzle shapes. It was challenging without being boring, the perfect mix."
"I have thoroughly enjoyed putting this puzze together!! Beautiful, vibrant colors.  Just be careful because about 2-3 pieces are the exact same size and if not placed properly, you'll think that you're missing pieces and you're not. Try to locate the misplaced pieces and you'll have a perfect puzzle üòâ"
Well made and good quality pieces.
"1000 piece puzzle that takes up more than half my glass coffee table. This puzzle was difficult to put together because there were so many pieces that worked in wrong places and throws you off. I had to spend so much time redoing. It‚Äôs definitely beautiful when it all comes together though. You get what you paid for‚Ä¶Also the delivery guy put the puzzle in front of my garage in the dark, I ran over a corner with my car and crushed some pieces."
"Early in the game we were fully convinced that one edge piece was missing.  Like many other puzzlers before us, we looked for what felt like hours and couldn't find the last edge piece.  So I took to the reviews and we were shook.  Many other reviews claimed up to 121 pieces missing!  We were distraught.  We lacked faith and confidence that we would end up with all 1000 pieces and therefore the sweet, sweet satisfaction of the last piece locking into place to create our masterpiece.But we forged ahead and through the miracle of Christmas and Hanukkah we slid the last piece into place.  In the group was a lifelong puzzler, first timer, and others in between and we had a great time figuring out the tricky parts of the picture.All the pieces seemed sturdy and, most importantly, all the pieces in our box were present.  Maybe the fact that we weren't sure about having a complete set actually added to the suspense?? All is to say, we had a great time and I will definitely repurchase a different puzzle from Buffalo Games."
Love it
"Vivid colors, fun to put together . Would buy another from this artist."
"The puzzle quality is not bad, it came with a picture of the scenery. The only downside is it came with one missing piece. Otherwise, it will be a good purchase at C$15. Despite the missing piece, I still have lots of fun with it.Update: I found the missing piece, so no missing piece. (added a star)"
"Although the print was clear, the pieces didn't fit well. Some had to be pushed in causing the puzzle to bulge.  Not your usual Buffalo games quality. But the puzzle was still fun to do and the image is pretty."
Gorgeous puzzle and great quality. Love all the puzzles by Daryll Bush.
"good quality ,great image. I have to like the image to enjoy the puzzle this fits the bill"
"If you want a tough puzzle this is it!! The odd shapes will test your patience, it took a little time but it was hard fun! The final result it beautiful"
This is by far the most challenging puzzle I have ever done! I am attaching a picture to help anyone who sees this review to see what the pieces look like!
This puzzle was perfect for an evening of fun. Hubby and I put it together while watching a movie. It‚Äôs easy enough to do in one evening so no need to let it sit out collecting dust and taking up table space.The colors are bright and the print quality is really good. Such a cute picture too. It wasn‚Äôt too easy or too hard.
Love the white & red together. So beautiful!
A bit more challenging than we originally expected.
I got this as a gift for my daughter who collects gnomes.
"I ordered this puzzle because I liked the gnomes and because another reviewer said it was so difficult that they returned it. The background trees were definitely a challenge, but I finally succeeded!"
This was an interesting and challenging puzzle to put together. Unfortunately there were a couple of pieces missing. One was an edge piece. This is the first bits and pieces we've put together. Many of the pieces had a slight curve to them that kept them from laying completely flat. I wonder if this was a return and had been rolled up in a puzzle mat at one time. I'm thinking we'll be sticking to buffalo puzzles for now.
This one was really challenging after we finished the gnomes and rabbits.  My sister and I usually take a day to finish a 1000 piece puzzle.  ( we've been doing them for over 60 years)  This one took an extra day and half.  Lots of fun.  Really enjoyed ourselves.  Thank you...
If you like a challenge this puzzle is for you! Pieces are all weird shapes‚Ä¶taking forever to put it together
"Maybe it‚Äôs me, but I don‚Äôt have the patience for this. After you get the gnomes finished, it‚Äôs one piece at a time. And because the pieces are such odd shapes it gets really boring really fast."
"Nice quality,  was fun to do."
Hard puzzle to do!!!  But beautiful and fun for the family to do together!
This is a nice design & quality puzzle. It's great for a rainy day or just some non-electronic  time.
If you do puzzles you know some pieces aren‚Äôt great quality and that wasn‚Äôt the case here. The pieces fit nicely together and the overall quality was great! A fun holiday puzzle for everyone to enjoy!
"I got this for my 92-year-old sister-in-law who enjoys doing all kinds of these puzzles with her adult children.  There is always one on the table being worked on.  It was reasonably priced, cute picture, and quick delivery.  All is well."
The style of the artist made this puzzle more difficult to assemble which is great. The only issue is that there was one piece missing. I have looked everywhere for it around the table and it was never found. It only took me mostly one evening and a little the next day. So disappointed.
"The pieces are really different than other puzzles I have done, but they are interlocking and it is a fun puzzle. My 57 year old son is enjoying it immensely."
"As other reviewers have said, this puzzle requires patience and perseverance, but is very satisfying when finished.  The ark and pond are relatively easy, but the trees and surprisingly, the animals are tough.  Many pieces have very little information as to where they might go.  It is not possible to simply sort, for example, for particular animals because the colors of the pieces are somewhat dull and many animals share colors.  The same for the trees and darker shades of the lawn.  That is not a complaint, just a hint as to what to expect once you finish the top and bottom.  Mine had all pieces and a poster, which is essential when the going gets tough."
"Between the complexity of the puzzle and the puns (indicated in the accompanying picture), this was both a challenge and a joy to work on!"
This puzzle is very colorful and fun to build! But Buffalo games please put your puzzles in a bag.
Hours of fun! It‚Äôs difficult but that‚Äôs what puzzles are for!
I bought it for my brotherHe likes the challenge with the 1000Puzzle pieces.He liked it very much.
Can‚Äôt wait to put this one together. All of the Buffalo puzzles I‚Äôve bought have been really nice quality. Am certain this one won‚Äôt disappoint.
Fun challenging puzzle. Buffalo Games is always a hit in my home.
"The quality of this puzzle is a bit off:  the pieces do not seem to fit together well - even when correctly placed.  This is a challenging puzzle, and I worked hard to move it toward completion.  About 3/4 from the finish line, it became all too obvious that pieces were missing - a puzzler‚Äôs nightmare!  Other reviews have mentioned this problem.I boxed it up and returned it.Such a shame because it is an interesting and creative puzzle."
"This puzzle has to be one of the most enjoyable one I've ever done. The colours are nice, animals are cute and difficulty level isn't that high. One of the best parts is the amusing narrative that painter Eric Dowdle accompanies with the puzzle. Highly recommended. üëçüëè"
"This company does crisp, clear images, so you can figure out where the piece goes, reasonably-shapes pieces - and the bears tearing into all the junk food is a hoot!  We need puzzles that are do-able, not overly tricky, to relax at the end of a brain-draining day.  This company has a series of camping scenes, I own all of them.  Nice slick surface to last, the thinness of the pieces means you'd better be careful disassembling them - the notches are the weak point.  Eventually, after several runs through (next year), I figure it will need some gluing, but -oh, the bears!!!"
"Fun puzzle to do. Colors were great, great size. Easy to see."
Most fun to put together. We‚Äôve put it together twice already.
Good quality and very colorful. Pieces fit nicely together. I would but again.
"This was a fun puzzle to do.  Quality pieces, beautiful colors"
I love puzzles and Buffalo Games are my favorite brand!  The pieces are thick and stay together.The colors are move vivid than other brands.
Fun and great picture
Fresh from the box. Many of the pieces are ripped or attached/not fully cut apart.
"Great picture, and the right difficulty level for me. Enjoy putting it together!"
"One of the most difficult puzzles I've ever attempted but all pieces were present and in good shape. A few pieces were still attached to one another so that was a little disappointing but with so many pieces to work with, it didn't take away from the overall enjoyment of the activity."
"This puzzle is extremely hard, none of the pieces fit together good it took WAY too long to get even the boarder together and they look crooked when put together. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not sure if I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll even be able to finish it."
"I have a nervous system disorder that makes fine motor control challenging.  So, I choose puzzles that appear or are labeled difficult.  I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m always seeking a challenge to overcome this disorder.  This is by far the most difficult puzzle I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve chosen to date.  Bravo!  Sincerely."
"I REALLY wanted this puzzle to work. I couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even finish the border because of missing pieces. Several pieces were torn, and none of them fit really nicely together."
"My daughter is a huge Harry Potter fan. I saw the puzzle and knew it was something she would really enjoy. I know the company reputation for high quality products. I think the puzzle is well worth the price, especially if it can give enjoyment to someone special."
"This puzzle was very average. A few pieces had cardboard coming off the back and came out of the box cracked. Also, the pieces do not fit together super well. It was just okay."
One of the harder puzzles I ve done Ô£ø√º√´√ß but very fun.
The pieces are not cut well they are all torn and don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t fit well together. I was not impressed with this puzzle at all.
"Quality of these puzzles is ASTOUNDING for the price, have that satisfying 'click and glue' from a quality puzzle, no bent pieces, no missing pieces (I will note I did go out of town and unfortunately left this puzzle on a table that my dogs had access to and I'm 99% positive they ate some of these pieces while I was away).But beautiful graphics! Put the puzzle together and could see all the details, the image wasn't smudged and the chaos provided just enough entertainment to keep me staring at the pieces and pictures (you get a smaller print and then a larger print) for hours. I will continue to buy these puzzles and as of today have bought the cat and dog one, in my cart I have 3 more in the set (rollercoaster, movie and the Candyland - absolutely worth purchasing again due to the tiger shark dogs that ate my pieces) and will be purchasing those next.Also the feel of the puzzle is just so satisfying, smooth and matte. SOOO happy I found these puzzles!"
"This is my second puzzle from this brand and in this series.  Absolutely love the picture as fun to put together.  Puzzle is more expensive than some other brands, but the pieces are a higher quality which makes putting the puzzle together a more pleasant experience."
"Love this puzzle. The pieces snap in nicely, it doesn't feel cheaply made, and best of all the matte surface makes it easy to see even under the light.It's also a very fun design, adults and kids both enjoyed it and we bought the others in the set as a result."
This was a great puzzle to put together. I appreciate how thick and sturdy the pieces are! I had no issue with any missing pieces unlike one puzzle from a different company. I also had no issue putting the puzzle together as the smaller picture not the poster reflects the current puzzle. The picture to puzzle ratio makes this puzzle and the matte finish super cute. I‚Äôm a puzzle saver so I will save this puzzle and eventually hang it. I bought another puzzle from this same company!!
"This was a fun puzzle to do.  I love doing puzzles with bright colors with fun scenes. This one didn‚Äôt disappoint.Pieces are a great quality and fit together nicely.  There were no peeling pieces, which is a pet peeve of mine.  The colors in the puzzle are nice and bright.Great quality puzzle for a great price!"
Love this puzzle!  Pieces fit together nicely: they have a really nice look and feel. There is no glare on the pieces so easy to work on the puzzle at night or when lighting is not the best.I have bought a lot of puzzles and this is one of my favorites.
Our family loved this puzzle while on vacation!  Great illustrations and fun to work on it.  Adults and 12 YO.
"Loved the quality of the pieces!  Totally worth the extra cost -  you get total satisfaction from the accurate fit between pieces.  One thing that really threw me was that the large poster picture of the puzzle doesn't match the puzzle.  I'm not talking color tone is off, but actual people are on the puzzle (e.g., jumping in the lake) that aren't in the actual puzzle.  Also, some of the colors are completely different (e.g., a running kid in the poster had green pants and white t-shirt, and in the puzzle the pants were gray and the shirt was green).  I kept looking around the box to see if this was intended to make it an extra challenge, but I couldn't find anything.  The small poster was accurate.  I also did the Picasso puzzle, and while it only had a small poster, it did accurately match the puzzle.  Not sure if there was a misprint, but I'd still get this puzzle, just for the high quality of the pieces."
"Loved the quality of the puzzle for the graphics, the puzzle falls apart very easily so keep that in mind! Such a cute and fun puzzle to do, lots of references to TV shows and movies that are classic"
We enjoyed putting together this puzzle only to find out there was ONE missing piece :(I wouldve rated it 5 stars with the quality otherwise.
Not only was the puzzle excellent quality the customer service is outstanding. My puzzle was missing a piece. Not lost within my home but missing out of the box. They asked no questions about did I lose it. They replaced the puzzle. I have had this occur one other time with another manufacturer. No response ever received. And I hate puzzles with missing pieces! Recommend you buy this brand.
"Pieces connected really good and don‚Äôt fall apart immediately after connecting, cute and fun puzzle for all ages"
This puzzle has great coloring and it was a great idea but the quality falls short. Way short. Lots of missing pieces and even extra pieces that have the correct picture but are cut wrong. Makes no sense how this can even happen. Beware!!
"This puzzle is great quality. The pieces fit together well and the colors are great. It was bit challenging due to all the facial features being identical, but it was fun to figure out. Enjoy"
