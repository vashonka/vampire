I bought this for my 9 year old niece for Christmas this year(2024) it's October currently so the product has not been used yet. I was a little surprised that this is marketed towards kids and teens considering that it comes with a retractable razor blade. And I understand that some people will cut things for their art no hate on that. Just that if you have it marketed towards kids and teens offer an option without the razor blade. Now I'm not going to give the blade to her but if I hadn't opened it an then i found out my niece was cutting herself with part of my gift i would be disheartened by that
"I like all the colors wished came with instructions on how to use the water pencils which had to Google , the draw pads are small but doable!"
Bought this as a birthday gift and my daughter let us know her friend loved it. It looked so colorful and inviting to start drawing. Everything inside looked like it was made well over all good quality.
"This kit of 73 art supplies is a great buy for a teen or adult who has some experience (even if minimal) with art/sketching.  It is a comprehensive set that includes about all the sketching materials one would need such as several types of colored pencils, sketching pencils, graphite for shading/blending, pencil sharpener, nice eraser, one paintbrush, a sketchbook and coloring book.  It is all enclosed in a nice, zippered case with a carrying strap.  Because of how comprehensive it is, I'd not recommend for a younger child.My only disappointment was in the size of the sketchpad.  It's only 5"" x 7"" with 28 pages.But beyond that, it is a great buy.  Recommend!"
I bought these for a special after school/weekend art class for 8-9 year old kids.  These sets will be great with all the different art mediums
"This kids' art set is a solid choice! It comes with crayons, pencils, pastels, markers and paper, providing a variety of tools for creative expression. The quality of the materials is great, and the assortment ensures endless possibilities for young artists to explore. Highly recommended for sparking imagination and artistic fun!"
My daughter loves it she is 6years old and love to draw and use it all the time. Sometime she use the map pencil and switch the next time. They also last very long time as well. Love how the case can be taken any where and it keeps every organized.
"Great variety, colorful! If you have a kid who likes art this is a fun gift."
"We got this as a Christmas gift for our son. The packaging and case for this product is pretty flimsy and not the best quality. The same can be said for the art supplies in it. It’s good for an inexpensive art kit, but keep your expectations low"
My grandkids have been busy creating
She loved it and it created hours of fun
"The packaging is great,it keeps all the art pieces together."
"I purchased this art kit for a 9-year-old girl, and I was so impressed with the quality and variety of supplies that I ended up buying it for another 9-year-old as well! This art set has everything a young artist could need, including oil pastels, crayons, colored pencils, sketch pads, and even a double-sided trifold easel that makes it easy for her to draw and create anywhere.The case is well-organized and easy to carry, making it a perfect gift for kids who love to craft. The supplies are high-quality and allow for a lot of creativity, whether she’s sketching, coloring, or experimenting with different art techniques. The pink case and design are adorable, making it a fun and stylish gift.It’s a great value for the price, and both girls absolutely loved it. I highly recommend this art kit as a thoughtful, creative gift for any young artist!"
Product came as described. It was a gift for 6 year old and she absolutely loved it. Quality is also good as expected for price paid. Hope the marker pens do not dry out soon. Thanks
Good set but it arrived broken on one side. It was supposed to be a gift but I didn't feel comfortable giving it like this...
Its was extremely organized. Amazing quality. Some small pieces. Color accurate. worth money spent.
"Have the kids use their creative abilities! They'll be great at drawing on paper, making jewelry, and having summer and winter fun. This is an all-weather activity. Great buy!!!"
This kit is fabulous. My niece is into all sorts of crafts.  She absolutely loved all the different components of this.  She can make so many different things the way she wants.  Would definitely recommend this item
It is a great product and gift for crafting and creating. Packaged very well.
I bought this as a gift for my grandkids.  It looks exactly like the picture.  I am excited about giving this to them.
9 year old still enjoys it. Variety of trinkets. Fun to do multiple crafts. Hard to slide everything back into the box once opened.
"Two of the ‚Äúwooden‚Äù beads were brown/gray AND deformed. So I‚Äôll never forget the fecal necklace I turned into a butterfly just by twisting the pipe cleaner and introducing wings.Otherwise, this is a superb box. The stretch bead jewelry cord can make many more pieces than there are beads in this kit. I remember we used to do square knots and even some jeweler‚Äôs super glue. Without a couple of square knots that cord won‚Äôt stay knotted.Even my 3yo can cut into the pipe cleaners with the provided scissors. The sequins are study as heck. The gem stickers and eyes really, truly stick, but can be reused with hot glue. This is a wonderful kit.If you end up with pipe cleaner jewelry, bend one end of the necklace or bracelet about an inch and a half from the end, twist it around itself a few times, and create a re-bendable hook. Measure how much you want or need on the other end, bend the cleaner at a 90-degree angle, make a loop, and secure the loop so you have fashioned an eye.This would make an amazing gift for a child of 3-14, and has literally helped my children (3 and 5) work together or chat as they create. No punching or hair-pulling. It‚Äôs been a crazy four months, and now my daughter is 3, so all of a sudden peace reigns again.I highly recommend this specific kit. It‚Äôs not cheap, the beads and sequins are not at all flimsy, the wooden pieces are custom shaped, and it won‚Äôt be hard to want to keep what your kids make üòâ"
Lots of quality craft items included.
"Got this massive craft supply kit for the kids. It has tons of stuff for making bracelets, crafts, art projects etc. Great for rainy days when we're stuck indoors and don't want to waste the whole day on screens."
The packaging held bk this item as draws but flimsy also the glue provided doesn't stick to the crafting items
"This was on one of my kids Christmas lists and they loved it. I was hesitant to purchase it at first, as it seemed like you could easily recreate this set with items from the dollar store. When it arrived and we saw everything inside I realized what a great craft set it is. I love that it comes in a case so everything is easy to clean up and organize. There are so many materials included that I would be surprised if we ever ran out of craft stuff again! It has giant pipe cleaners, regular pipe cleaners, wooden spools, string, beads, pompoms, and so many other items. I think I even remember seeing glue in the box.I would definitely purchase this set again, and I think it makes a great gift for crafty kids. Everything seems to be of good quality and I love how colourful all of the craft supplies are."
"It's okay, my kids like it but for the price I was expecting more. I just picked up an arts and craft kit from a local store for ¬£6 that has about half the amount of items. My kids enjoyed it though. I did think that for the price an ideas book would come with it but sadly no."
Lots of stuff to do
I purchased this for an angel tree gift to give to a child from a less fortunate home. This product had the most complete set and variety of colors that I could find for the price point. Great for gifting to get someone started in their passion for art!
I bought this for a friend who loves to draw. It included everything she needed and it was good quality for a great price!
I like the quality of the pencils and the variety of things that came in it . The size was good and I had easy access to each item and was able to store them away properly. I was able to carry them around all the time and easily use them . I love the color that I was given and the versatility was great
I bought this as a birthday present for a friend of mine and so far they are enjoying it!  I have not heard any complaints.
Everything
My daughter loves this gift. She has been using it since she got it for her birthday.
Granddaughter loves to draw. This had everything she needed
It was a gift and they loved it!
"I'm very impressed with the assortment provided for sketching and drawing. I like that all the graphite pencils are included as well as white and black charcoal and charcoal sticks are especially pleasing. I am very glad that sandpaper and a variety of blending stumps are included. Makes a great value. The included sketch pad is also nice and comes in 3 colors: white, black, and tan.I'd say the quality of the items themselves is pretty nice. This a very giftable item and great for any art student or beginning artist.The only thing I'd say to improve is the interior design is a bit flimsy (the straps started fraying after day 2 of using it), and the kneaded eraser cannot fit back into it's elastic area once it's been opened and kneaded. If there were a pouch or pocket on the OUTSIDE that could hold the kneaded erasers, that would be ideal. I also feel like pencils will start falling out of their elastic holder if jostled or small - so once again an pocket or multiple pockets would be idea.I also think the knife for sharpening pencils is shoddy and I'm buying a new one right away that is sharper.Overall, glad I made this purchase and it is a great selection of materials."
"The pages are super durable, the charcoal was soft blending, fun to use, and I like the color variety you can get from the pencils."
"I like the pencils, the charcoal pencils and the weight and size is perfect for me. I have tiny hands and it's very comfortable for me to sketch. This would a great gift for Christmas or birthday."
"I like this set. It includes most art pencils you may need stating out. I suggest you order a set of white gel pens in addition, because this kit does not include them. (they are for highlighting) Great value. I'm sure Leonardo would have ordered this kit when he was starting out, had it been available to him. The only drawback I encountered was that the pencils did not indicate what the different pencils were used for. So, experiment with each pencil to see its potential. It comes with 3 charcoal 'bars' and an eraser and sharpener. I had to pick up a WHITE charcoal bar, as it was NOT included in this kit.I think it is good value and I'm glad I have it."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I have only done an unboxing and quick swatching but here is my review thus far:It has been a long while since I’ve gotten the urge to draw anything that wasn’t a doodle on line paper with whatever utensil I had in my hand or at my desk. I was gifted some gorgeous sketch books and decided to find a budget-friendly set of pencils. I was primarily looking for a set of graphite pencils and stumbled on this bundle. For the price of about 5 “fancy” pencils, I could purchase this entire set. Since I am a beginner and haven’t drawn in a while, I decided to go with this option… plus it was one that could be delivered same-day or one-day.After a speedy delivery, I opened the box to find a good quality case. Upon opening, I checked to be sure I wasn’t missing any items and everything came as it should. The instruction booklet leaves you wanting a little but it is nice to have. It includes a suggestion of utensils to complete the picture you see. The sketchbook is a decent size and you get a variety of colors, not just white. You get a good range pencils from hard to soft and the pencils have a decent range as well. The compressed sticks of graphite and charcoal are nice, even though I have to Google how to use them. The sandpaper block comes with a good amount of sheets on it. Everything included seems to be of B to C quality on a grading scale but with all that you get, that is excellent for the price.My only gripes are that the willow charcoal came pretty broken up and my pastels also had a few breaks (only 2 of them, the rest were fine). The blending stumps have slight imperfections but you have a razor right in the package to clean that up! I only took away 1 star for the imperfections but the kit is everything the description says it will be! This is an awesome gift for yourself or anyone (even children) who would like to dip their toes into drawing but need a little push to get started. I can’t wait to sketch with this set and I may update my photos to include completed art. This is a GOOD buy!"
"This is my kiddo's go-to set for art on the move, and they're CONSTANTLY sketching. For those with the need for a basic drawing kit or a thorough at-home set, this one hits the spot. I've seen the pieces stay durable and intact through many an hours-long trip in the car."
"I bought this to use while recovering from surgery.  It was a fun little kit to use.  Lots of choices on pencil weights.  You get a little starter sketchpad which is nice too, but you'll quickly run out of paper.  This is really set up as a gift set.  Everything is cleverly secured with its own elastic which makes the kit very organized, but do I really need to have everything strapped down?  No, not really.  In reality, it would be nice if the erasers, sharpener, etc were loose in a zipper pouch.  In the end, it's great for the price, but really a student starter set. The price is good or what you get.  It's not Koh-I-Noor, but neither is the price. 5 stars"
"Great starter kit!  Lots of goodies and the case is really wrong, serviceable and practical!  Yay!"
"We recently purchased this as a gift for our child's Kindergarten teacher to show our appreciation for all her hard work and care. She absolutely loves it!The set is comprehensive and includes everything an aspiring artist could need. From a variety of sketching pencils to colored pencils, erasers, and blending tools, it‚Äôs all neatly organized in a sturdy case. The inclusion of a tutorial book, sketchbook, and paper is a wonderful touch, making it perfect for both beginners and more experienced artists.The quality of the materials is impressive. The pencils are smooth and easy to work with, and the sketchbook paper is of good quality, making drawing and sketching a pleasure. The tutorial book is a great addition, offering useful tips and techniques that can help enhance one‚Äôs artistic skills.Our child's teacher was thrilled with this gift and has already started using it for her own artwork as well as for classroom activities. It‚Äôs a versatile and practical set that can inspire creativity in anyone who loves to draw and sketch.Overall, it's a fantastic product that provides excellent value for the price. It‚Äôs well-crafted, comprehensive, and perfect for artists of all levels. We highly recommend it as a gift or for personal use. Five stars!"
"My daughter love this. It came with everything. The picture said it would nothing was broken. Nothing was bent, and all the colors of the pencils was so pretty."
"This set has a wide variety of pencils, markers and more.  Great that it comes with a sketch book and watercolor pad so you don't necessarily have to buy paper to use this set unless you want something bigger or more paper.  All items appear to be well made and decent quality.  The zippered case with a place for everything really makes this easy for storage and to keep up with. Very giftable and very fun to use.  Really, really great art set!"
This is one of the best ive purchased. My grand children loved them and the colors are vibrant and its perfect pen quality and very durable
It looks very nice! Many varieties of art supplies to choose from. Compact and organized. Giving it as a Christmas gift and it's only November so I didn't know how the products themselves are. That's why I'm giving it a 4. Will try to update later.
"I had VERY low expectations , but the drawing set just surpassed everything I could have hoped for. High quality, the case is also great quality sturdy , I love that the case doesn‚Äôt have some weird random logo or brand name, the case is a plain all black which I was not expecting but very happy to see. The quality of the supplies is excellent. I got two sets one for each kid and they loved it. I was really surprised by the quality of the color red pencils and how vibrant they were . I will definitely buy from them again !"

Comes with a lot of pencils! Color pencils, metal sharper so it‚Äôs durable two pads one for color other for sketch it‚Äôs amazing for professionals & beginners like me who‚Äôs trying to get make into drawling! I say stop wasting time and get you one so you can start creating your image üíØüíú"
Great value for the price. This made a fun gift for a friend.
Great for the kids
"The Pooboo Folding Exercise Bike is a decent choice for budget-conscious buyers looking for a compact indoor workout option. The foldable design is very convenient for small spaces, and it’s easy to set up and store away. It operates quietly and has adjustable resistance levels, making it suitable for light to moderate workouts.However, it doesn’t feel very sturdy or strong, so it’s best for casual use rather than intense training. That said, at this price point, it’s definitely worth the purchase for its functionality and convenience.I’ll upload pictures soon to show how well it fits into my home gym setup!"
"So, I've been trying to get into shape. 6'3, 245 pounds. Large, but not metal-crushing large (anymore). I'd like to do some cardio that doesn't have me in a gym or outside getting chased by dogs, so I decided to pick up an exercise bike.Honestly? I have no great experience with these things. I just know that I'm on the tall side and that goods often aren't made with that in mind, and I'm large enough that promises like 'Supports up to 300 lbs' matters. But seeing this bike on Prime made me decide to take a gamble. Worst case, I return it, right?Yeah, I won't be returning this, because it exceeded my expectations.First off, it came packed well. No mishaps in shipping, everything arrived solid and undamaged. Credit to the Amazon shipping department and whoever designed the original packaging I suppose. Not that it would be easy to damage. Big, solid, precious few parts.Which leads me to point two. Assembling this was a breeze. I buy furniture online enough that I've picked up a few electronic tools to make assembly and disassembly of such things easier. In this case, I didn't even feel the need. It's just a handful of bolts, nuts and washers to get into place. The included tools are more than enough to do the job right. The key mechanisms are already pre-assembled and self-contained (the wheel or drive or whatever) and just require fixing into place. The instructions are easy enough to follow. This was all finished up easily in an hour or so. The electrical parts were a breeze as well. Just plug things into the other plugs. It's next to impossible to screw up.Now, with that in mind, actually using the bike is the real test. Again: 6'3, 240ish pounds. It's fair to say that me just getting on this bike and using it, period, is a fairly serious stress test of the parts. Also, I've gotten up to 20+ mph while using the bike. In both cases, everything seemed incredible solid, I've already done well over 50+ miles on the bike without issue. At one point I heard the slightest creak from the bars that bike rests on. A couple quick tightening of the bolts and everything was great once again.The electronics also seem decent. I have an Apple Watch Series 8 on my wrist, and I noticed that over time the calories burned seemed to largely converge, so that seems solid. Likewise for the heart rate monitor. Minimal and non-flashy, just like the difficulty controls (it's just a knob). Works extremely well. The seat can be adjusted as well. Bars/handholds seem very sturdy, and I swap between them as I work out.If I had to name any possible downsides, it would come down to two things. First, the 'tablet holder', I suppose you'd call it, is not something I would trust. Too thin for most tablets, and of course that will block the screen/readout, so it seems pointless anyway. I'd never trust a tablet on that small of a surface, it would just end up on the floor. The included drink holder is placed a bit awkwardly, but that seems like an afterthought convenience at most. Finally, actually stepping over the bike can be a bit of a hassle - but that's the case with actual bikes anyway. Gotta mount up one way or the other.Short story is, at this price, with this level of quality, it's turned out to be a great purchase, and I am exceptionally pleased with this. It's now part of my daily routine, and I trust it to get me where I want to go exercise-wise as a guy who just wants to get in better shape, conveniently.One last thing: I had a question that I emailed their customer support over, and they replied instantly and helpfully within 24 hours. Honestly, within 5 hours. That's pretty nice service, as I'm sure people are used to getting zero response or not even having a direct route to contact customer service with their purchase.Long story short, great deal, so far super happy. If that changes I'll update the review, but 50+ miles in so far and we're still golden."
"I rarely leave reviews, but was so pleased with this on day one that I wanted to. While instructions were sparse, it was fairly manageable and quick overall to assemble. I am extremely appreciative of how lightweight this is overall and how it easily folds up well for storage - I live in a pre-war New York City apartment, so space is at a very high premium, haha. I have not worked out regularly in quite a while and was looking for something I could use at home, whether or not I add a gym membership on top of it. I do think the overall body is a little high to swing my leg over, but I’m only 5’4”. (That reason and the instructions are why I took one star off.) The levels of resistance are noticeable enough to provide challenges when you want them.I am extremely impressed with how quiet it is. My floors are old and terrible and my 20 pound cat can sometimes make the boards creak! But this bike is great - it’s so quiet I haven’t even tried it with the mat that I got to put underneath it.Definitely a great purchase and value for this price."
"We purchased this bike based on the strength of reviews, and how we planned to use it - which is basically when we need to train indoors due to weather conditions.  I’ve had the bike for a week, and here’s what I think about it - which is I like it a lot!1) easy enough to assemble.  I’m not very technically oriented, but I didn’t need the videos…just walked through the booklet step by step.  It took me about an hour start to finish.  Pros:  Everything is included - even extra screws if you need something later or something is missing.  Also, you don’t have to find your toolbox for this.  All screws and tighteners are in the package which is well marked and labeled.  Very smart design on that.  Further, some of the screws/nuts are already on the bike parts, so before you think you are missing something, be sure to check the parts you are assembling.  Cons:  Could have used a bit more detail when hooking up the display panel, but it works easily so no real issue there.  Also the pedal foot wrap things weren’t completely specific in the directions, but I looked at the picture on Amazon and figured out how to attach those.  Lastly, the seat had several staples not stapled.  I’m assuming the ones that are stapled will hold up.2) Super Smooth riding.  It’s a cinch to change the level of difficulty and they are clearly marked.  The ride itself is just very clean…nothing shakes or rattles…just peddling!  The display is good if you are measuring those criteria. I’m more of a “set the timer for 15 min and go” kind of rider.  The bluetooth device is coming, so I will see what that does for me.  Pro:  The smooth ride is just very pleasant.  Great for serious exercise or for doing while reading, etc.  Con:  Others have mentioned the “ipad holder” and frankly, it isn’t one.  I would not trust my ipad or phone on that very small shelf. But that is not a deal breaker for me as I can prop my ipad on a nearby table.3) Folds and moves easily.  This takes up very little space unfolded for use, and even less if you want it to be out of sight when not in use.  Pro:  Very compact yet sturdy, if this makes sense.  It feels like it is made well, at least the biking parts of it are.  Con:  Some have said that it’s hard to get on, but I don’t have that problem.  If the bike is unfolded properly, it’s just a matter of lifting a leg and hopping on!4) Bands for arm work:  I love these bands because one of the issues with a stationary bike is “what do I do with my hands?”  This solves that issue by providing an option for working out using the bands.  They aren’t so tight that it’s impossible to do, and they add a nice light tension to the arms while biking.  The handle bars and even the side bars give you plenty of options on where to put your hands.  Pro:  Bands add interest and comprehensiveness to the workout.  Con:  The directions for the arm bands could be clearer, but I accomplished it.All in all, there is excellent value for the money in this bike.  You can even save a few dollars if you’re not too picky about color.  It was shipped quickly and packed well.  Nothing broken or missing in the package.  I hope to be using this bicycle as part of our at-home fitness for years to come."
"It was easy to put together, only took about 45 min's. It is pretty durable and is great for my needs."
"Having read the reviews on this bike, I ordered it, delivery was simple, unpacking was an exercise in space management, it was really packaged tight.  Most reviewers said 1 to 2 hrs, well at 82 yrs old it took me a bit longer, taking breaks.  The instructions were easy to follow as was the hardware, every step was marked out.  The only issue was getting the metal cable connected, it wasn't easy but I got it.  Downloaded the app, and did a 30 minute workout.  The seat was very comfortable.  It's a learning curve with the display functions but all and all this bike represents a good value for the money.  Having used similar bikes  at the gym, this bike is on par with more expensive brand names.  It's also very quiet."
"This was a relatively straightforward build once I got it out of the box.  For some reason, I had a hard time getting everything out.  It was well packaged; possibly too well.  I opened the top first and tried taking everything out but that was difficult so I ended up just cutting the sides.  Once out, the build was straightforward.Everything seems of high quality and lightweight.  Not a big bike which is great.  My wife and I are both under 6' so the compact size is a huge plus.  The lcd is straightforward and simple.  Shows time, pulse, calories, and distance.  Has a holder for your phone or tablet.Overall, excellent basic bike for the price.  The wife likes it very much so that's what counts.  I use it too and like it.  Five stars."
"This is good bang for the buck.  Went together fairly easily, seems to be pretty sturdy, and it's pretty comfortable.  Can't say anything good about the app, i got it connected but subsequent attempts could not find the device, and i could not control the app.  It just would not respond, and I could not find any info on how to actually use the app.  The bike is good, the app sucks.  Note:  I was dissappointed that the resistance was so weak, so I took the cover off the flywheel mechanism (Yes, I had to cut it) and found the flywheel had shifted out of position by more than 1/2"".  (There was evidence that the box got dropped.) Once I adjusted the flywheel to its proper position I had good adjustable resistance and it was quiet."
"Love this machine. Was scared to invest sight unseen but love everything about it so far. I opted for the S23 version.Design: Sleek with bright blue accents. It should be known that the ""wooden"" pedal inset is faux wood.Assembly: Mostly intuitive. The instructions are a bit difficult to read and the parts are not easily recognizable in the diagrams but still simple enough to figure out even without consulting the supplied video. Pro tip: read the pedal stickers. The left pedal screws in backwards.Stability: Excellent. I am 275lbs and even on the highest resistance I only get the slightest sway.Noise level: Extremely quiet. It is quieter than my ceiling fan. The floor boards under the bike make more noise than the flywheel.Fit: Comfortable. I am 5 feet 6 inches and found the adjustments and width of the seat very comfortable. The seat back IS in a semi-reclined position which does not adjust in tilt so if you don't like sitting back while cycling maybe opt for an upright cycle.Exercise level: Good. I am a heavier lady and so have quite strong legs and at the highest resistance it's a trying work out even for me. Very happy that I don't think I'll outgrow this machine any time soon.Bonus: Even my cat has enjoyed working off his kibble!"
"The assembly directions and sealed parts for each step were so easy to follow...the screws should be a little longer as they are hard to engage AND the last step (the handles were a nightmare, had to tip it forward and leave off the spring washer to get it to screw into place).Ok, it's assembled! It is sturdy, a great size, it is quiet and comfortable, I like the display...it's my first piece of exercise equipment and I am so happy with it. I think the price point (it was on sale) was totally worth it.I am looking forward to adding this to my walking routine; it will be great during the winter but its been really nice during this dreadfully hot weather too...I jump on it and watch a little tv with the fan on!I'm just so relieved and happy it is great quality!"
"like the ease of assembly, the quality, the smoothness and quietness of operation and the record keeping of the bluetooth app. Oh, forgot to mention that it is comfortable."
"Product looks and functions as advertised. Product was very expertly packaged and quality details regarding finish, welding, mechanical fasteners and overall appearance is excellent. Frame is sturdy and easily accommodates my 6’2” height, 255 pound weight and 31” inseam. The seat is easily adjustable and equally as comfortable. Electronic module functions intuitively well. The magnetic resistance method works very well and allows the pedals to turn very smoothly. This machine is virtually silent while in operation.I purchased this machine to enhance the recovery of a total knee replacement. I give this product an “A+” and is easily comparable to the $2500 machine used in my rehab recovery clinic. Great job to Merach!Thank you Amazon for offering this at an incredibly affordable price. I placed the order and the product was delivered within 3 days!Now I can complete my therapy and recovery in the comfort of my home.RegardsGFT"
"The bike is well made and performs as expected. It provides sufficient resistance for my needs, to exercise my arthritic knees and provide some cardio. I currently use the #6 setting (out of 8).  I am approximately 70 inches tall. The monitor is very useful to track time and distance and heart rate. The bike was super well packaged, and the assembly instructions were straightforward and required about 90 minutes to assemble.  After a few weeks of use, I am very satisfied."
"I have been searching for an  excercise bike, need to strengthen my leg muscles before knee surgery, and after.  It will be good for weight loss and cardio.  I have hesitated because I wasn’t sure if I could put it together myself (65yr grandma).  After reading the other comments on how easy it was, I said I would give it a go.Let me say I had no issues doing it myself from the instruction sheet provided, took me approx 1.5 hrs alone.  It also has a product code on the outside of the box to scan with your phone camera which will link to a YouTube video if you need visual help.  It comes with a cardboard with the steps 1-6 all separated into nice little squares with  the bolts, spacers and screws all attached in each square for each step! Excellent instructions, both on booklet and YouTube video.Also included are the 2 tools needed to screw in or tighten the bolts.  It has an lcd monitor that shows calories burned, distance, time, pulse rate,.  There is an app to download for your phone, but I have not used it yet.I am 5’5” ,no issues with the length of the pedals and the seat is adjustable and very comfortable.I got it on a great price, it’s a 5*** purchase for sure.  Thank you MerachFor this awesome product."
"Nice bike for the price, but not if you are 6 foot tall. The bike is short by 1 to 2 inches in order to have my legs fully extended. Good thing, the bike is for my wife! The bike was easy to assemble, thanks to good instructions. The bike is sturdy with a comfortable seat and should last a long time. The control panel is a bit cheap, but if you use the app with a tablet it won't matter. The app is ok once you figure out how to use it. You can use Kinomap which is a much better app, but it is costly."
"I bought this bike about a month ago and have used it 5 days per week since it arrived. It was easy to assemble, taking my time and following the directions, it took me two about hours. The parts are all fairly substantial, bolts are heavy duty and well machined. There were no issues putting it together. I am in my early seventies and decided, on the advice of a sports medicine doctor, that it would be good exercise for my aging knees. I am six feet tall and find the bike very comfortable with the seat moved back to its furthest position. It also adjusts easily for my much shorter wife. More expensive bikes have more bells and whistles but this one has everything I require. The elapsed time and distance are what I pay most attention to and as I gradually increase the tension, the heart rate monitor will come in handy. Just in passing, the tension adjustment is really simple. So far,I am really pleased with my purchase; the bike is sturdy and whisper quiet and the only unknown will be durability. At this point,  I don’t detect any issues that would lead me to believe that it will fail any time soon. If your needs are similar to mine, I have no hesitation in recommending this bike."
"Easy to assemble, the assembly parts are grouped by steps which makes it easy. The video for the build steps is also very easy to follow.It is very sturdy , works exactly as a magnetic bike does.Only downside is that it won't be appropriate for taller people. Up to 170 cm is perfect, beyond that not going to work.It is exactly what we needed so it is 5 star for us, if you are taller then 170 would not recommend.Additionally if looking for a high resistance frequent resistance change experience not made for that.It is great for steady cardio with a decent resistance level. Not for a hardcore veteran, very good for a beginner to intermediate."
