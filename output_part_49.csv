"I have had this product for 6 months or so. I‚Äôve used to every single time after I wash my hair.This product has definitely been life changing but my hair type makes it difficult to get the best results. I don‚Äôt get the shiny, sleek look that everyone wants. I still have some frizz but it reduced it a lot.I love all the attachments they include. Unfortunately I barely use the barrels for curls. In order to get good curls, you have to straighten your hair or it will be a mess. I have a difficult time  ‚Äústraightening‚Äù my hair when using the attachments. So you might need a straighter if you want the best optimal curls.Keep in mind, I need to get better with it and I‚Äôm learning. I‚Äôm getting better with them and each time I‚Äôve reduced my time a lot. It‚Äôs a really good product, with learning curve. It‚Äôs easy to use once you get the hang of it. It‚Äôs lightweight which is a big plus. If you have hair like mine, it will still look a bit frizzy.When it comes to value, I don‚Äôt regret spending the money I used to buy this. I love it, I look forward to washing my hair because of this product üòÖ"
Gran producto
What a life changing experience. I have very long hair and I used three of the attachments on my hair the first time. I think with some practice I will be able to master this product
"I didn‚Äôt get the diffuser or the wide brush attachment, but I did get everything else and it is just as described, also the serial number worked"
"I like the product in all aspects (packing ,delivery & quality )"
"I am 66 and don‚Äôt like fixing my hair. I have very fine hair and I cut it in soft layers.I was terrified of how I could fix it.  When my hair is wet, it is curly.I bought this big barrel curling iron and thought for the price,  If it doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll give it to one of the grandkids.  From the very first time I used it it was very easy to use.  It took out all of the tight curls and made my hair loose.Super easy to hold, super easy to use, you can adjust the temperature to what you need, and a great price.I put it on number one because my hair is fine and it has highlights in it.And this is how it softened my hair to big loose curls.And a big plus for me is my hair doesn‚Äôt get hung in it at all.I do love it."
"Listen! Great but! Curls came out popping! Great product, easy to use. Definitely buying it in a different size"
"I've Been sreaching for a good curling wand for the past two months now, am really amazed with this one just what I wanted perfect sizing, good quality,very smooth, lightweight, nicely designed and heats up very quickly up to 356¬∞F. It's a must buy ü•∞"
"I like the fact that it‚Äôs light weight, heats up fast and I love the color. Can‚Äôt wait to install my wig and give it some nice bouncy curls !!"
"I love it so far. It's the perfect size for making my short, shaggy, mullet-y haircut a bit wavy and textured. Heats up quickly and very easily curls my REALLY thick, pin straight hair. Also, great size to take with me in a bag! Not too big or bulky; very light, simple, and easy to use.Though, PLEASE watch out for your poor neck and ears! This thing comes with a nasty bite if you accidentally touch the iron to any part of your skin. Just a precaution, nothing against how well the product works. Didn't leave any embarrassing burn marks, so that's good."
"I bought this for when I travel out of the country so I wouldn‚Äôt be devastated if an expensive hair tool short circuited. I LOVED the bouncy curl it gave me so much, I was using it at home some too! The larger barrel was perfect for a loose curl/blow out look. I have really long fine hair, but a lot of it! And I could curl my whole head in under 5 minutes. But less than a 10 months after purchasing, it all of sudden stopped heating up, like at all! I maybe used it less than 30 times. I noticed a weird burning smell coming from it despite me having it on a very low setting, and the next time I turned it on, it wouldn‚Äôt heat up at allll. That being said, it was less $20‚Ä¶ So I guess I got at least $20 of use from it."

"The curling iron is good. It heats up very quickly and curls hair fast. I had curling iron on turbo and on #5. I counted 5 seconds and the hair was already curled. Old iron takes 20 seconds.  But be careful you can burn your hair. The barrel is longer too. You can burn yourself or your client. The white tip is cool, but short; I kept burning my fingers. The dial is very easy to twist while curling hair. Too close to the release bar."
"Nice curler, gets the job done and still it great condition after 4 years"
Gives a nice tight curl
It‚Äôs been several months of regular use of this hair tool.  It‚Äôs still working perfectly.  Every once in a while I accidentally hit the power button but it‚Äôs quick to reheat
"I am in love with my Tymo iconic plus. I have very thick ,frizzy curly hair. It always takes a while to straighten. However, this wonderful straightening brush has made my mornings so much easier and less stressful since hair styling time has been significantly cut down. This hair brush heats up to 450 degrees and literally in one pass my frizz is smoothed out and my curls are straight as can be. I can also do large sections which cuts the styling time down tremendously. Its a very quick heat up. I love how the display shows the brush getting to its temp you set it to so you know when its ready to use if you don't hear the beep. I also get that wavy bump on the back of my head which is very hard to get with a normal straightener but once again this brush is able to smooth it out. I cant say enough great things about this. Highly recommend. Side note: I have also tried the Tymo Ring comb the older version and also newer version and neither one of this compare to the brush!!"
"Love this product. Does not pull your hair. I can quickly straighten my thick curly hair, took less than 10 minutes. So easy to use, turn on, quick heat up, brush thru hair, done!! Great price."
"I brought this on a whim, hoping it would have decent results. It works really well. I have 4B hair and it can be a little extra wavy sometimes. this brush tool really did straighten my hair and it did it in about 20 minutes sectioned and four parts. The brush heats up pretty quickly and gets really hot. I found the back of the brush was hot to the touch, but I was able to lay it down and not burn any surfaces. The only thing I would advise, is to be sure to remove any lose hair from the brush immediately after each pass. It seems to generate a bit of smoke if you don’t. Overall and pleased with it. I could go over my hair at the root with a flat iron maybe but it’s straighten my hair well."
"It has been a total lifesaver, a real answer to my prayers. I just love it, it works amazingly and it’s much much easier for me to use, it’s simple but heavy duty enough to straighten even my frizzy corse hard to manage hair so now I’m able to straighten all of my hair without frustration or total exhaustion, before my arms shoulders & neck would hurt so bad from trying to straighten each part of my hair section & piece by piece with my regular hair straightener but I just couldn’t do it with my weakened health conditions & disabling limitations I was only able to find the strength tolerance & endurance to straighten the front of my hair but now with this new heavy duty straightening heat brush it will straighten all of my hair just by brushing my hair several times which is a whole lot easier than any thing else I’ve ever tried, there’s no secret to it. It heats up fast & it will get pretty hot so be extra cautious & careful but other than that I love it. It’s a total game changer, I look & feel 25 yrs younger just by being able to do my hair the way I’ve always wanted hoped & dreamed I have never like my hair but now I love it more than anything, my hair is beautiful soft straight manageable and I can actually run my fingers through my hair without getting caught or stuck all because of this wonderful product. it’s amazing. Thank you so very very much. God Bless I highly recommend it."
"I am 50 years old and I have had curly hair my entire life. Ringlet style curls. Serious curls. I have never been able to achieve straight hair. This hair straightener is nothing short of amazing. It heats up in seconds (no exaggeration), it doesn’t burn or damage the hair, and the entire process took about five minutes. I cannot believe how well it works. I am not a ‘girly girl’ and I still was able to achieve amazing results with this product. I would buy this product again and again. I absolutely love it."
"This was not the quick, easy, make your hair straight and silky tool that I thought it would be.  I read 100s of reviews and waited for the ""hype"" to die down before I tried it, because it sounded too good to be true.Maybe the results vary drastically based on hair type but for reference, I have ethnic hair that is long and naturally curly.  Without a ton of product in it, if I let it air dry, it will get very poofy.  When I want to wear my hair straight, I have to get it done professionally.  The best I can do on my own after 45 minutes of blow drying and taking little strips of hair to flat iron for another 45 minutes...is semi-straight hair.  It still has some significant poof to it.This brush didn't do any better.  It straightened my hair a bit, but it was still poofy.  I tried the highest temperature as well as doing smaller strips of hair and it just made my hair hot. I used a heat protectant too and that didn't seem to make any difference.  I'm not a stylist or a product design engineer, but I think the design of the brush doesn't pull the hair tight enough to get all of the wave out.  When the stylist straightens my hair, she  brushes a small section and pulls my hair tight as she runs the flat iron over it.Companies pay/incentivize for people to post positive product reviews as well as AI generated reviews, so not sure if that was the case with this product? I find it very hard to believe that this tool can produce the straight, silky look on it's own without the help of a flat iron.  But maybe it can.It just didn't work for me."
"I can hardly believe how good this works. Takes my hair from unruly to sleek and smooth in a matter of minutes.  So glad I made the purchase, definitely the best hair appliance I have ever used!"
So first off I love this brush... It heats up within seconds and does what it is supposed to do...Now I have 4a frizzy hair I took the heat up to 410. It definitely straightened my hair and gave it a blow out look! That being said it is not going to give you a sleek silk press look - you might want the airflow flat iron instead if that is the look you want to achieve.I like using it on my wigs - makes life easier to comb the hair (with this heat brush) after washing and drying then I go in a flattening with a flat iron.
"This hair straightener and brush combo is an absolute game-changer. It works so fast and is incredibly easy to use — perfect for someone like me who's always in a rush. In just a few minutes, my hair looks smooth and sleek, and the best part? It doesn't burn or damage my hair at all! It's gentle, yet super effective, leaving my hair looking great without any hassle. Honestly, it's a lazy person’s dream tool. If you're looking for a quick, safe, and easy way to straighten your hair, this is it! Highly recommend!"
"I can’t say enough good things about this curling crimper! It gives me those perfect beachy waves in just minutes, and they last all day. The plates heat up super quickly, and the crimper is easy to use, even for someone like me who isn’t a pro at styling. I love how it adds volume and texture to my hair without making it frizzy. Plus, it has adjustable heat settings, so I can use a lower heat when I want to be more gentle on my hair. This tool has seriously cut my styling time in half. If you’re looking for gorgeous, long-lasting waves, this crimper is a must-have!"
"This works great! I was excited to try it and I did my entire head in about 10 minutes, it heats up fast, works fast, and looks great as an end result,I would definitely recommend to it. This product really exceded expectations. And it's so easy to use, no twisting your... Ver más"
"I recently got my hands on the Allure Three Barrel Curling Wand, and I’m pretty impressed! It creates those gorgeous beachy waves in no time, which is perfect for my busy mornings. The three-barrel design makes it super easy to use, and I love how quickly it heats up. My only minor gripe is that it can be a bit tricky to maneuver at first, but once you get the hang of it, the results are totally worth it. Overall, a solid 4 stars for effortless, beautiful waves!"
"This curling iron is amazing! It’s super easy to use, heats up quickly, and gives me perfect curls every timeI’m really happy with this curling iron. It’s lightweight, efficient, and my curls last all day.Great quality for the price. Heats evenly, doesn’t snag my hair.Highly recommended!"
"I can’t praise this curling crimper enough! It effortlessly creates those perfect beachy waves in just minutes, and they hold beautifully throughout the day. The plates heat up in no time, making it incredibly convenient, and even as someone who isn’t a styling expert, I find it easy to use.What I love most is how it adds both volume and texture to my hair without contributing to frizz. Additionally, the adjustable heat settings allow me to choose a lower temperature when I want to be gentler on my strands. This tool has genuinely halved my styling time, making my mornings much smoother. If you’re after stunning, long-lasting waves, this crimper is an absolute essential!"
No regrets. It works well with my water wave wigs. The curls are define and last a long time. It is easy to handle and once handle properly you don't get burn easily. I like the led light feature which shows the temperature. Overall good product
"For lack of a better word, I am the ""fool"" in foolproof when it comes to hair tools. This one genuinely fits the bill for being a tool anyone can figure out. It's simple, easy, relatively lightweight, and doesn't require much effort to do your whole head. Downside that I haven't figured out is it has an auto-shut off (good for not burning your house down!) that happens after about a minute of use, so you have to keep adjusting the temp."
"The Alure Three Barrel Hair Waver is amazing and a must-have hair appliance for effortlessly creating soft, natural-looking waves. Or even adding more body to your hair as it did mine.  Its 1-inch ceramic tourmaline barrels heat evenly, cutting down styling time and delivering smooth, frizz-free results—even on my frizzy hair. The LCD with temp control allows for quick heating and precise adjustments, protecting hair from excessive heat. The dual voltage feature makes it travel-friendly, and despite its triple-barrel design, it’s lightweight and easy to handle. I was thrilled with the boost in body and fullness it gave my lifeless hair—not overly wavy, just the right amount for a fuller look. Highly recommended!"
"I’m thrilled with the results I get from the Remington Shine Therapy 1-Inch Hair Straightener! My hair looks and feels incredibly smooth and shiny every time I use it. The ceramic plates are infused with Moroccan Argan oil, which genuinely makes a difference—I can see the shine right after I finish styling. It heats up quickly and has an adjustable temperature setting, so I can control the heat level and avoid damaging my hair.The slim 1-inch size is perfect for both straightening and adding a little curl to the ends. It glides effortlessly, without pulling or snagging, and my hair stays sleek and frizz-free all day long. It’s also lightweight and easy to maneuver, making it comfortable to use.For anyone looking for an affordable, high-quality straightener that adds shine and smoothness, this one is a fantastic choice. I feel like I’m getting salon results at home—highly recommend!"
"Since I bought the Remington iron, I have noticed a big difference in my hairdressing routine. Its design is elegant and lightweight, which makes it very comfortable to handle. It heats up quickly and offers various temperatures, perfect for different types of hair."
"I recently purchased the Remington Hair Straightener, and I have to say, it has exceeded my expectations! First off, the sleek design is both modern and user-friendly, making it easy to handle while styling. The plates heat up quickly, reaching the desired temperature in no time, which is a huge time-saver during my morning routine.One of the standout features is the advanced ceramic technology that helps reduce frizz and adds a beautiful shine to my hair. The straightener glides smoothly through my hair, and I love how it can tackle both straightening and curling effortlessly. It’s versatile enough to create different styles, whether I want sleek, straight hair or soft waves.I also appreciate the adjustable temperature settings, allowing me to choose the perfect heat level based on my hair type. This feature is crucial for preventing damage, and I feel more confident using it regularly. The auto shut-off feature is a great safety addition, giving me peace of mind if I ever forget to turn it off.Overall, the Remington Hair Straightener is a fantastic investment for anyone looking for an effective and reliable styling tool. It delivers salon-quality results at an affordable price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in search of a new straightener!"
"This works better than the $50 flat iron I had to replace. I was hesitant because  the price so much less than the one I replaced but after reading the reviews I figured I try it. SO glad I did. Heats up fast..is sturdy...it curls and straightens and oh ys, it adds shine! Kudos!!c"
"It works pretty well. The different settings are nice. But I would recommend wiping with a damp cloth (not while plugged in!!!) before the first time you use it. Because I just used it and there was this strong chemical smell, like carcinogens. Hopefully the smell will go away over time. I don't exactly see the ""shiny"" that everyone's talking about either but it's still a good straightener for the price I got it at. It takes 2-3 runs at 370 to flatten my really wavy hair. Also you can change the temperature and it comes with a temperature guide in the manual"
"Smooth, shiny, frizz-free hairThe Remington Shine Therapy straightener has been one of the best investments for my hair care. It straightens quickly thanks to its ceramic plates infused with argan oil and keratin, leaving my hair much shinier and softer to the touch. I also notice a great reduction in frizz, even on humid days. Plus, it reaches the ideal temperature in seconds and is very easy to handle. It is perfect for both straightening and creating soft waves. Totally recommended for those looking for healthy hair with a professional finish!"
This is hands down the best flat iron I have ever used. It works well. It is exactly as described. It leaves the hair feeling so soft and shiny. It straightens really well. Don’t be discouraged by the price of this flat iron. It works so much better than the expensive ones I have purchased.
"This is literally the best iron I’ve ever used, and I’ve used a lot!  It’s heats up super fast and glides smoothly on my hair, no tugging or snatching.  The built in argan oil and keratin make my hair super shiny and soft.  It curls my hair easily too which I wasn’t expecting.  Highly recommend!!!"
This straightener heats up extremely fast!!! (20-30 seconds) and it beeps when it is done heating up. Buttons on the side for power and temp control work great and are in a good spot. I don't hit the buttons when I am using it which is a huge bonus. My hair doesn't get snagged or pull. Glides along hair smoothly. It is very sleek looking. My hair is naturally wavy and has some curls and this straightener worked great to straighten them. I didn't have to pass it over my hair multiple times. The cord swivels really easily making it super easy and efficient for use. There is also a small lock at the base of it to lock it closed when not using it.  Hope this review helps.
"My 13 year old hair straightener finally kicked the bucket, so I did some searching around for a replacement and landed on the Remington Shine Therapy 1” Flat Iron, Argan Oil & Keratin Plate Hair Straightener. I was happy with the price and after using it a handful of times I’m even more impressed with the results! This straightener heats up very quickly, it’s light weight, I like that the buttons are on the side (my old one had the power button inside close to the plates and a dial for the heat), and I like that you can lock the straightener closed to store it away. I added a before and after photo of my hair for reference."
Great little tool to have in your overnight bag. Works great for drying and styling. Two heat speeds and one cool speed. Nice red color. Easy to assemble and disassemble. It works really well and puts away well.
"I purchased this for my mother ... she was looking at these but mentioned that she was not sure if she'd like it, so she did not want me to buy anything expensive and she would upgrade if the concept worked. I had looked at the yellow Blow Dry Bar version of this in a store ... which retailed at around $100 - $200. That version, despite the cost, was only a smaller brush OR a larger brush. This came with two brush sizes. I was very skeptical  about the quality due to the low price. That proved to be unfounded as my mother said that she really, really liked this one and there was no need to upgrade to a more expensive brand.One thing she really mentioned liking is that the chord swivels/rotates as the unit is being used so the chord doesn't get tangled up as you turn the appliance during use. It's lightweight and easily maneuverable and the different brushes are easy to attach and take off.She mentioned it is so much easier to use this than the traditional method of holding the blow drier in one hand and a brush in the other. The hot setting is very hot/too hot ... so the low setting is all she uses, with a quick blast of cool air at the end. She has medium/short hair above her shoulders and fine hair, not thick, so this works well for her. She doesn't do any curling or waving and keeps her hair straight.The big brush is good for body, near the roots. The smaller brush is more for the under part of your hair. It is nice to have both brushes to use ... many more expensive kits only have one brush attachment. This also comes with a blow drier attachment. While it's not as powerful in terms of dispersing air as a regular blow drier, it does a good job of drying hair without having to use a brush. Don't expect to go from fully wet to fully dry in a minute or two, but it will  give you a little bit more shape and body, especially on fine hair.Overall, for under twenty bucks, this thing is amazing. She had fully intended to upgrade to a Dyson after but will keep this unit. It's a little lightweight and flimsy ... but it works as it should. The value and performance is fantastic and it is highly recommended."
"I bought this hot air styling brush kit to replace a similar one that broke after many years of use (I dropped it on a tile floor one too many times). So far, it's been as good for styling my short, fine hair, that has a slight wave in it which tends to flip the wrong way unless I style it - which annoys me, as my old one did. I hope it lasts me as long too. I had my old one just over 10 years! The old one still turned on, even after drop #4, but the handle where it met the electrical cord was too just broken to make it safe to use anymore. No amount of duct tape around it would convince me otherwise.I don't actually bother styling my hair most days, since I work from home, but when I want my hair to have more style, I use this, with a light, natural styling gel, and been happy 90% of the time with the results. The only times I haven't been happy is when I'm in a humid area. Humidity makes my hair go nuts; either it loses all the style I spent time putting in by drooping and going flat, or it gets super wavy, curly, and/or frizzy, which drives me crazy too (I hate having my hair in my face), so I end up using a hair tie and clips to hold it back from my face, and/or I wear a hat. I don't use fixative type hair products due to the toxicity of most of them. I have asthma, very sensitive skin and a sensitive scalp. I breakout from most styling products. Also, most fragrances in most products and sprays, tend to trigger my allergies and/or asthma. Using just this brush and the natural styling gel are really my only options, and work fine, mostly. I deal with it if they don't. They work well together when I'm home in Colorado, most of the time. Humidity here does the same thing as it does anywhere else to my hair though, but it's rarely very humid here.I want to warn everyone, as with all styling brushes and blow dryers, the Revlon Hot Air Brush does get HOT while using it. Not so much the handle where you hold it most of the time, but all the metal parts do, and so does the handle near the styling attachments area. So, please be careful when changing out the attachments, cleaning the brushes, putting it away, or packing it after use. Some parts retain heat for a while. Give them time to cool down, 5-10 minutes, or use something to protect your fingers/hands if you need to change attachments while using it.I also just can't stress these next things enough:1. DO NOT use it near a sink or bathtub with water in it. If you accidentally drop it into water while it's plugged into a wall outlet, you could electrocute yourself, and/or start a fire. It'll be ruined too. Water and most motorized things do not go well together. it's not a waterproof item.2. ALWAYS, when you finish using it, unplug it and leave it on a counter, far away from curious little ones if they are of concern, or hang it up, to allow it to cool off, before you put it away or pack it in a suitcase! The risks of burning someone or something, and/or starting a fire, are real. I scorched a t-shirt slightly, when I went to pack it in my suitcase, before giving it enough time to cool off first. I had wrapped the t-shirt around the handle part, to cushion it in my suitcase. When I unpacked it at home to put it away, I found the scorch mark on the shirt. Lesson learned. Luckily, it wasn't one of my new t-shirts I ruined.3. DO NOT leave it plugged into a wall outlet, even if it's not turned on or hot, and forget about it. Power spikes can damage it, and cause an electrical fire if it sparks. Also, you don't want anything else happening either, such as a young child getting ahold of it.So, yes, I recommend you try the Revlon Hot Air Brush Kit. If you don't like it, return it before the 30 days return period. Just be smart about using it and storing it. If it lasts me 5-10 years, I'll be happy."
"Works well and is smaller than the other trendy stylers. I have both and this one works equally as well as the other and is not so bulky.  Price is good too. Of course, this one is as loud as the others, but that was expected."
"I should have bought this much sooner, I have thick shoulder length hair and this dryer is great. My hair has a noticeable smoothness and bounce. The included barrels are perfect for short/medium length hair, and it has impressive drying power."
This blower works great for my curly hair! It’s super convenient. I’m a little annoyed at the sudden price drop. I wish I would’ve bought it now that it’s $12. That seems like a reasonable price!
"I had an earlier model of Revlon’s barrel dryer that was pink & white for over 15 years that finally quit on me. It had the “negative ion” & cool shot. I loved it. When I needed to replace it, I bought this one.Both dryers were loud. I didn’t really care too much about that, because you have to sacrifice something at this price point.The old pink one was great at giving my fine limp hair volume but not giving me the fuzzy (I’m blonde with help from my hairdresser) muppet look.I figured the new model would be at the very least, as effective.Nope.I got volume alright, but as an added bonus, it made my hair look like cotton candy.I added some heat protection spray the next time in addition to my other products and still, very frizzy.Thankfully I could return it. Lessons learned: most of the time you get what you pay for, & nothing is made as well as it used to be. I wasn’t planning on leaving a review. So I didn’t take any photos of my electrified do. Apologies."
"I love this product. Very cost effective, work great for me. I use it almost every morning before work, heat is efficient, easy to hold and comes with different size curlers which is great. Small enough to be carried in luggage. I bought two so far."
With the heat it's body melt then it damaged
When I got this it had a USA plug in it so I sent it back.  I didn’t want to risk getting another  one so I left it.  It’s not the item I wasn’t happy with I just didn’t like not being able to use it.
"UPDATE 4/22/2023: Been about 3 1/2 years and this thing is still going strong.  Staying nice and sharp.  I've noticed getting my hair cut down the street that some of the barbers use these as well.  If this breaks I'm definitely buying the exact same one again if it's still around.____________________________My main goal for my hair is just in beard/stubble trimming.  I am not a professional and I don't cut my own hair.  The goal for my trimmers is that they provide reasonably close trimming on the sensitive skin of my face, since I can't use a regular razor.  Also, I want something that is quality, and I would rather spend more for something that lasts.  My last requirement is that the trimmer be wireless.  With that as the background:The first trimmer I ever bought worked surprisingly well for being so cheap, about $35.  It was a ConairMAN HC1100R.  Holds a charge well, powerful motor, close-enough shave for the neck area.  Only problem is the mechanism for tapering the blade would break after months of going back and forth between neck and face (adjusting for longer length on the face).  This caused the blade to become unstable, loud, and cut poorly.  I've been through three of these things, and when my third one just broke in October of 2019 despite being purchased in February, I decided I needed to move on.In a hurry I purchased the Wahl 8290 which I have nothing bad to say about because I never used it.  My genius self didn't bother to realize it's not cordless.I next jumped on the GOOLEEEN hair clippers, cordless, LED display, IPX7 waterproof, and advertised as ""professional.""  Long story short, the motor sounds and feels weak, the cutting mechanism is half plastic, and the thing was immediately tugging out my hair even in already short and not very dense facial hair.After a bit more research, I decided to try the ConairMAN Super Stubble, also with a waterproof rating.  This one has a pre-attached motorized guard that you can adjust digitally.  I can't believe I spent $112 on this thing.  The motor feels weak and cheap, and the whole unit feels a little cheap.  The guard itself is a nice try at innovation but something about it made it take waaaay more passes to evenly cut my facial hair, like I've ever experienced before.  And no matter how many passes I did take, it still never quite felt like I was done.  Also, that tiny motor that adjusts the guard seems like it will be the first thing that breaks, which is crazy because one of the ""features"" of the device is that the motor automatically returns the guard to a preset length when you turn the device off, and then returns yet again to whatever length you were using previously once you turn it back on.  Meaning there are a ton of unnecessary movements of the motor that are only going to ensure it's the first thing to go.  The only positive thing I can say is that when you flip the guard back and just use the blade without the guard, you get a pretty close cut, so close it actually cut my skin a little bit but nothing terrible.After doing even more research, watching more youtube videos, etc., I finally landed on this, the Wahl 8148.  At about $30 less than the Super Stubble, I'm very happy.  I'd be happy even if it were the same price as the Super Stubble.  The motor feels strong (though it seems to be comparably louder than some other nice professional models I saw reviewed).  The unit feels sturdy, and the blades make quick and even work of my facial hair just like my first Conair.  I also like that, unlike all the other models I tried, the tapering bar for the blade operates on a smooth gradient, not large clicking progressions.  Meaning you can be extra meticulous in your blending which seems extra useful when you're working with hair that's overall short to begin with.  You can operate cordless or plugged in.  Some reviews complain there's more power when the unit is plugged in, but in my opinion that's a feature, not a flaw.  This means the unit can utilized the extra draw from the wall that you probably can't get from a lithium ion battery alone, if you need that extra power for whatever reason.I expect this thing to easily provide years of reliable use and I will definitely be back to post an update if not."
"I love that Wahl supporters the American worker.  And as long as they continue to do so, I will support and buy from them ALWAYS.  My last clipper I bought almost 20 years ago from Wahl, finally hit the bucket.  The wire broke from too much twisting.  And it was near where it goes into the clipper.  So, I could not strip the wire and reconnect.  So, I wanted a quality product, but more importantly, support my fellow Americans.  So, I knew who to turn to.  And of course, I was not disappointed.  This clip is wireless.  But you do have the option to use the charging wire if you want.  But as long as you charge it, it will hold a charge for a long time.  The motor noise is very smooth an quiet.  No need to adjust the motor speed like the other ones they sell for $20-$40 ish dollars.  This is a one speed.  You can adjust the height of the blade.  Comes with a few clipper blades.  I would recommend if you want to use it for longer hair cuts, to purchase a set that comes with small to very tall blades, like the #10, 12, 14, etc.  They are found on Amazon.  It also comes with a brush and oil, with instructions.  It does not come with a barber robe.  You will have to purchase that separate if you want to keep the hair off of you.  They have nice ones on Amazon for like $15-$25 dollars.  The one I got is very nice and has a hair brush to get all the small hairs off.  Some people might look at the $90 dollar price and say that is too much.  Even say, all I need is a $30 one and it does everything I need.  And that may be true.  But having both of the price ones, I can tell you, especially if you cut your hair a bit long, over an inch, this is the way to go.  With clean hair, and a proper oiled blade, this not only cuts quick, but gives you an even cut.  So, when your hair starts to grow, it won't grow uneven because of the clipper.  The hair does not get caught in the blades, which may cause pulling.  And having it portable, makes it easy to take it with you, and do hair cuts any where.  It is very annoying cutting hair with the cord in the way and hitting myself or my kids face or head.  I highly recommend this over the $30-$40 ish dollar ones.  But whatever you decide to do, stick with Wahl and support your fellow American jobs.  Without them having jobs, they cannot buy your products or services.  It is not one companies job to create American jobs, so the other companies can have sweat shops in China to have record profit ""margins.""  Buy American, save our country.  This is the first review in over 150 that I can say, ""Made in the USA."""

"The product was delivered quickly. The hair dryer bag and other accessories look very good at first glance. I had to return it because when I plugged it in and the hair dryer heated up, it caused the light in my bathroom to flicker. It remains unclear what this is connected with."

This hair styler is very good and very handy and comfortable to use. This had made my morning very easy to style my hair before I leave for work. It is light weight and easy to use. You can set temperature as your wish and style your hair. This work perfect for my curly hair and make my hair manageable. I am very satisfied with the purchase I made and money I invest on it.
I used to use this back in middle school and re ordered them for my daughter to use them. They work great and super sturdy.
In the early stages of fixing my daughters hair and this tool is a lifesaver. Makes the simplest hair style so elegant!
Better quality than many of these. Still would go with the brand name as they all tend to be super cheap and bendy.
