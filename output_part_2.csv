"We purchased a Samsung Neo Qled in 2021.  It is a wonderful TV and the user menu is great.  We came back for this new Samsung in a larger size.  The new one has a good picture.  However, the user menu has changed for the worse.  All kinds of ads which are much bigger than the apps you are using.  In addition, we love the ""Picture Off"" option to enjoy the audio only.  This works with all the apps except Youtube TV.  (This works flawlessly on our older TV set with Youtube TV.)  Also, some apps will not load at all like SiriusXM.  I was on the phone with Samsung Support for hours and hours.  Reset to Factory, soft resets, hard resets, uninstalling apps, etc. and nothing fixed it.  Please Samsung, roll back the updates to match the 2021 TV sets.  We are now debating whether to send this back or deciding it's just not worth the trouble to do so and be stuck with it.Update:  After talking to YouTube TV Support and a couple of other apps, we find these apps are not compatible with the options on the new Samsung TV.  We have decided to keep the TV and hope Samsung will listen to our request to fix these problems."
"This TV definitely has Glare & Reflections.The Picture is OK with a totally dark room with no windows.Also the Display mode for Film maker seems to be the best.The other options make TV programs too sharp & looks really phony,My old 2005 Phillips TV had a great picture but quit working.. as a really expensive replacement I was really hoping for way better."
"Was delivered in a little over a week, which was longer than I wanted... But it was a good price so I decided to wait for it. Delivery company was very responsive though and worked with me to get the TV delivered. Works well and has a great picture. Super easy to setup if you have a Samsung account. You can charge the remote control by the little solar panel on it or by USB-C. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone."
"Beautiful picture and perfect size, exactly what I was looking for"
"I spent a lot of time reading the specs on 4K and 8K models.I opted for 4K as the overwhelming content is in 4K.I chose this model for its overall superior qualities, first off most of the bargain units you find are 60 Hz which can lead to motion blur in action scenes and sporting events. This unit is 120Hz.Inputs the bargain units have a couple HDMI  This one has Four HDMI, 1 Coaxial, 1 Network, 1 Optical and they even included 2 USB.The picture quality is excelent,The set auto adjusts brightness much better than my older Sony XBR which I was happy with.The second I connected my computer to this monitor my computer recognized it and adjusted itself properly, the disply was a perfect fit on the screen. 4K res and the font was big enough to read comfortably.I am not a game player so I cannot offer to review on what I have not done.As for the built in AI feature, the unit offers the user to have ""Alexa"" or Samsungs ""Bixby"" As we already had an Alexa device in the room I opted to configure the Bixby option.  Both are equally as frustraiting and flawed, and helpful as you allow them to be.This particular model comes with Samsun+  tv a very nice freebee it does require high speed interet to funtion. ""As does the AI.I hope you find this helpful."
"I ordered this 65” Samsung as part of Amazons Prime Days sale. The TV is great. Very modern and thin with several HDMI ports for accessories. The picture is great and the set up was pretty easy. It didn’t take long to go through the wizard and add all my apps and streaming services. We use DirectTV streaming and the app works great along with all the others. We also purchased a Samsung soundbar with subwoofer and the set up with the TV was super easy and paired immediately. Only giving 4 stars because the delivery was terrible. You set up the delivery date after purchase and it was a week, not Prime. That would have been fine but on my date of delivery (which I needed to work at home for) they didn’t show up and they didn’t even notify me. The next day no communication either! They finally acknowledged they didn’t show up and my next delivery date was almost 10 days later. Took 3 weeks for a Prime delivery, clearly they were just trying to sell TVs but anyway, the product is good. Recommend the Samsung soundbar and sub as well."
"Likes: easy to setup since I already had account with Samsung .Its much easier to connect with internet if you use Ethernet connection .The weight of TV was little surprising when I set the tv up myself ,much easier if you use two.Packing was outstanding for great protection and preservation in shipping .I used SMART THINGS APP of Samsung and calibrated tv with my IPhone and it was an outstanding and easy setup.Picture quality is beautiful ,sound I use Yamaha receiver and connectivity was flawless .DIRECTV 4K channels are so beautiful .Electronics of Samsung is a perfect choice you cannot go wrong .I highly recommend this Tv even though they say it’s mid range .Watching tv at a slight angle was unnoticeable of any flaws .Overall I give this Tv ease of assembly A+,Picture quality A+,Sound A,Remote you will lose because it is small if not careful but it serves its purpose .Amazon delivery was handled with care and excellent ."
"My SagaI bought the Samsung 65-inch Class QLED in mid-September. Two weeks later it stopped working. I called Samsung and they said they would send a technician over which took about two weeks (granted I was away on travel for five days).After chatting with the appliance company, I sent them photos of what the screen was doing so that they could bring the right parts. But when the service technician got there, he replaced the parts but the TV did not work. He said the display failed. He said that he would have to come back with a new display that took another two weeks. He came back change the display and it still didn’t work, claiming that the display he had was bad. I called Samsung again and they said they would initiate an exchange. The exchange would take 10 to 15 days. Then they informed me that it would be at least until Nov. 27 before they would call to set up delivery of an exchanged TV. I got an appointment for delivery on December 6. And it was delivered.It’s not that the staff was at fault or bad. The appliance company was very accommodating- they came on-time. Samsung staff always responded with texts and emails. The two-delivery people were very helpful. They put it together and set it up.The problem is Samsung’s process that it takes so long to get this completed.The Samsung policy with a product this new should be an immediate credit or immediate exchange.Now to the product:The Home Screen is terribly designed, not intuitive and quite ugly. The remote is full of advertising buttons and it has a bad design compared to older ones that had this nice curve design that fit well in your hand. Worst of all the remote cannot control audio when you are using the optical output- and I even have a Samsung soundbar! Switching between connected device is slow.I would have expected more for $1,000."
This was my first purchase of tv online and must say I am extremely satisfied with the product
"This Product is really good, pretty user friendly and compatible, picture clarity and refresh rate are really awesome. Sound also really good more than expectation compared with price"
Resumption is high quality
2 Pin Plug . I doubt ESMA Certifications.Not recommended in UAE.
"I needed to replace a 50"" TV in my sun room. Much ambient light coming through surround windows. The picture that my new QLED 4K QN85D Series Neo Quantum 55"" TV is quite brilliant despite the amount of ambient light. It arrived promptly, was unboxed and assembled after viewing a YouTube video showing how this is done. I highly recommend the YouTube unpacking video as there are some parts of the re-assemble that are not explained in the almost useless directions supplied."
Love everything about my Samsung TV.  Great product for a good price.  Picture is sharp and colors vibrant.  Stereo sound is unbelievable!  Very happy with my purchase!
"Bought from and shipped by Amazon. Amazon Prime delivery and Amazon Prime return were 5 star. Because of the likelihood of needing to return this TV, this should be kept in mind.For the same reason, consider taking detailed pictures of how the TV is packed when unpacking it. In particular, take pictures of how the two parts of the stand are placed in the styrofoam packing. Also, pay close attention to how the stand goes together. In returning it, you will need to disassemble the two pieces, and this can be difficult to do. Of course, save the box and all the packing material.Problems From Day One:Bluetooth audio lag: this problem was constant, though it varied in severity.Blurring, staccato picture:Example: A race car quickly moving down a racetrack and filmed through the windshield: the road in front of the car was a blurry, muddy mess, only having clarity farther in the distance.Example: People twirling flags. The flags had a distracting, strobe like jump throughout the movements.Remote Control: The remote in size, shape and color very much resembles an Amazon Fire Stick remote. However, whereas the Fire Stick remote feels solid and well-made, the Samsung remote because it has no batteries and is solar powered, feels flimsy. Using it, it feels not at all durable and feels like it  will break with normal usage.Dead by Day Seven:With hardly more than 12 hours of use during the first week, the TV simply and  completely died.Returned thereafter."
I’ve always been a fan of Samsung TV’s. I’ll probably purchase a new one for my  bedroom at Christmas. Amazon made it easy.
The tv is awesome
I'm not a connoisseur of TVs but this is fantastic! I feel like I'm at the theater!
"Purchased this TV specifically for watching sports because of how high it was rated for clarity. The picture is great when watching 4k content. Picture also great on most channels. Tends to be a little grainy at times with older TV shows but that is to be expected. Where it fails immensely is watching sports, specifically football, where any fast motion becomes completely blurry. I tried watching YouTube to solve these issues and found a ton of content on this because apparently this is a problem that they said could be cured in picture settings. I must have tried at least a dozen recommendations. I talked to Samsung product support and they couldn’t fix it either. They kept saying it was likely a cable signal problem. I have two other Samsung TV’s including an older one and their pictures are better. I also did a signal test for cable and it was very strong. Also tried hooking the TV up directly to the cable modem with a high quality Ethernet cable and the picture did not improve.I would not recommend this TV if you want your sports to be clear. It is good for most other things."
The picture is beautifuland sharp. I received a good deal on Prime Day
"The 75 inch TV arrived on schedule and was easy to set up on the legs. I would strongly urge reading the unpacking instructions provided on the outside of the box, makes life so much more simple. You're going to need at least 3 people to unpack and set up. I used the legs that came with the tv but may mount on the wall in the future. You're going to need two people to hold the tv (it's pretty heavy) and the third will need to slide the legs into the slots on the back. I hadn't realized that there are little white clips in the leg that, when extended, raise the tv up about 2 inches higher (for extra clearance, like the sound bar I bought to go with it). One clip in the legs was up and the other was down and it took a few tries to figure out why my tv was sitting at an angle, but after a quick second glance at the instructions I realized my error and fixed it. You will have to apply some blunt force to the legs to get them all the way in to the slots. This tv has a ton of features, I would suggest looking up videos and articles to figure them all out. I am a former ROKU user so I was hesitant and went ahead and bought a ROKU ultra to plug into this, but after getting used to the layout and navigation of this tv I'll likely be returning the ROKU. This has all the main streaming channels I used to watch on my ROKU, I just had to get used to the new layout. Picture is very nice, I'm no expert but for the price, you're going to get an amazing picture (I did have to lower the brightness from 50 to 25, not sure if that's the default but it was a bit too bright at first). The rechargeable remote (same as charging a phone) is great, even has a small solar panel on the back to recharge when you aren't using it (though you'll have to put the remote face down). The remote has a mic on it and once I installed Alexa on it it works like a charm. I just tell the remote what I want to watch and BAM!, it goes right to it! Worth the money, worth the time, very happy customer."
"The SAMSUNG 55-Inch Class 4K Crystal UHD DU8000 Series Smart TV has exceeded my expectations. The picture quality is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep contrasts thanks to the 4K Crystal UHD and HDR features. Watching movies, sports, and shows has never looked better!One of the standout features is Object Tracking Sound (OTS), which creates a more immersive audio experience by tracking the action on the screen. It’s a small but impactful detail that really enhances the viewing experience, especially for action-packed content.The smart features are intuitive, with easy access to streaming services like Netflix and YouTube, and the built-in voice control makes navigation effortless. Setting up the TV was a breeze, and the slim design makes it look sleek in any room.The only minor drawback I found is that the remote feels a bit basic compared to some higher-end models, but it still gets the job done. Overall, this TV is a fantastic value for anyone looking for a great 4K experience without breaking the bank. Highly recommend!"
"Tv works good picture is great.  The delivery went smooth, brought in the house, unboxed and turned on to check before leaving"
"Perfect delivery and the size is unbelievable. A bit heavy so I’m lucky I workout and was able to set it up on my own. Great sound, beautiful quality and imagery. Only thing I will say is the apps can be glitchy and slow. I bought a YouTube movie yesterday and it glitched and was having a hard time loading about 4-6x through the movie which was a bit annoying. If you aren’t tech savvy the remote and in-phone remote system might be difficult to understand and use but you’ll get the hang of it. I recommend this for the price. $700-ish after taxes and free delivery is a steal. Hopefully the glitchy stuff resolves a bit"
"I’m upgrading from a 2019 Philips 65” 4K TV. Only because the Philips wouldn’t restart after a power surge.Every other thing did. (Yes I do use surge protectors)This Samsung is the first TV I’ve bought since 2020. I didn’t realize the advances in technology and looks.It’s also the first Samsung I’ve owned, ever. I’ve only had it for about 36 hours as of now, but it’s becoming more easy to use and navigate the menu. I’m not completely familiar with it yet, though.The only complaint I have, and this may sound crazy to some, is that the picture may be TOO CLEAR.It has what is described in some YouTube videos as the “soap opera effect”. Watching some movies on Dish Network and BluRay, it seems as if the viewer is watching the characters live instead of in a movie. The picture can be adjusted to different settings, to reduce this effect, that are more to the viewer’s preference. And there are many “micro adjustments” that can be made, appropriately enough called “expert settings”. I’m no expert though.I don’t regret the purchase at all. But, if I’d watched those videos before buying, I might have chosen to buy another model Samsung. Or maybe even a different brand. Mostly because I learned that Samsung doesn’t support Dolby Vision or Sound. I have my 7.1 surround system for sound anyway, so that’s not a problem for me. Anyone who is dependent on the TVs sound capability, should be aware of the fact that Samsung and Dolby Vision don’t play together.I’ll get used to this new TV soon. But I should have done more research before buying it. I guess 5 years is a very long time to jump in TV technology nowadays. One more thing about Samsung that surprised me is that they don’t supply the mounting screws for their TVs. I had to order some separately from Amazon. The ones I found are the right thread size, but (when using included spacers) are at least 1/4” too long, maybe 5/16”. I learned elsewhere that the recommended thread depth is 11-13mm. A person can either use more spacers or cut them off at the right thread length.This is a positive review. I know that I bought a great TV at a good price (approx. $640). I’m just going to have to get used to all the new technology it has. And the super clear picture will take me time to get used to for sure. Even though my 2019 Philips was a 4K TV as well, it was nowhere near as clear as this 2024 Samsung."
"I’ve been using the HP DeskJet 2855e for a couple of weeks now, and I’m quite impressed with what it offers for a budget-friendly printer. Here’s my detailed breakdown:Design and Build QualityThe HP DeskJet 2855e has a compact and lightweight design that easily fits on a small desk or shelf. Its clean white exterior gives it a modern, minimalist look. While it's made mostly of plastic, the build feels sturdy enough for regular home office use.Setup and ConnectivitySetting up the printer was a breeze! The wireless setup is straightforward using the HP Smart app, and it connected to my Wi-Fi without any issues. I was able to print from my laptop, smartphone, and even my tablet effortlessly. It also supports AirPrint, which is a plus for Apple users.Print QualityFor a printer in this price range, the print quality is decent. Black-and-white documents come out sharp and clear. Color prints are vibrant, though not professional-grade quality. It works well for everyday tasks like printing homework, forms, or casual photos. If you're printing high-resolution images or need professional color prints, you might want to look at higher-end models.PerformanceThis printer performs well for basic tasks. It’s not the fastest, but it's good enough for occasional use. The scan and copy functions work as expected, and having these features in one device is convenient for a home office setup. However, if you plan to print a lot, the print speed might be a bit slow for your liking.Ink and Running CostsHP includes 6 months of free Instant Ink with the purchase of this model, which is a fantastic deal. The Instant Ink program automatically delivers ink to your door before you run out, and it’s based on the number of pages you print, not how much ink you use. After the trial period, you’ll need to subscribe to a plan, which can be affordable depending on your printing needs. Otherwise, HP ink cartridges can be pricey, so this is something to keep in mind.Pros:Compact and space-saving designWireless connectivity with mobile printingEasy setup with HP Smart appFree 6 months of Instant InkAffordable priceCons:Print speed is slow, especially for large documentsColor printing quality is averageInk cartridges can be expensive without Instant Ink subscriptionOverall, the HP DeskJet 2855e is a solid choice if you're looking for an affordable all-in-one printer for light home use. It’s easy to set up, works wirelessly with multiple devices, and includes free Instant Ink, making it a great deal for casual users. However, it’s not ideal if you need high-quality color prints or fast print speeds for heavy workloads."
"I thought it was going to be something complicated to understand on how to get it set up and print any papers i needed. On the contrary it’s simple with the app, i can print any image/ google doc/ email, etc. I haven’t used the other features it has but so far it’s been AMAZING, you can select the quality/ size of your paper. The only “problem” i would say it has is its not bluetooth compatible, that i know of, so i can’t connect to my laptop without downloading app again in it."
"Summary:- tried, unsuccessfully, to set the printer up to print from my son’s iPhone and his laptop- printer set-up app will not allow connecting to the university wifi as it is a public network (according to the HP agent)- the set up app does not give an option to complete the set up with an Ethernet cable (cable NOT provided) even though the printer does have an Ethernet port - the manual specifically discourages the use of the Ethernet port as it will restrict the use of some features. Not to mention that obviously the use of an Ethernet cable only allows connecting to a computer and not a smart phone- HP recommends on their website to use the chat option for support as it is faster. Customer support via chat is terrible in response time and support provided- in the end, 40 min wasted on the chat - problem not resolved - stuck with a printer I cannot return as it is past the return deadline - ordered an Ethernet cable and praying it will at least let my son print from his laptopDetails:I purchased this printer earlier this summer for my son to take to his college dorm room. He moved in yesterday and proceeded to set it up to print from his iPhone and his laptop using wifi. He is on campus in the dorms so the wifi is the one provided by the university to the students. The printer would not let us set it up saying this wifi network was not supported by the printer/hp app, to try another network or contact HP support. The printer does have an Ethernet port (cable NOT provided) but the setup app only offered the option to set up by wifi, no option to set up using an Ethernet cable. The printer manual  also specifically discourages the use of an Ethernet cable and warns it will not allow access to all the printer features. They even mention that they cover the Ethernet port on the printer with a sticker to deter people from using it. And obviously you cannot connect an Ethernet cable to a smart phone. The printer does NOT come with an Ethernet cable so we could not test it. I contacted HP support via their website chat using the link provided in the error message. I had to wait 20 min before being connected to an agent. But the frustrating part was the delay in response from the agent between each single question/answer. The agent asked 2 basic questions in 2 posts - first post was to provide info to identify myself and the printer - second post was to confirm my problem statement. I answered each question immediately and had to wait at least 5 min after each answer to get his feedback. I know it was at least that long as each post on the chat is marked with the time it was sent. After 15 min of wait (in addition to the initial 20 min to be connected to an agent), he answered that the university wifi was a public network and therefore would not work. He advised to try using the hotspot from my son’s iPhone. I answered that my son’s phone carrier/plan does not allow for hotspot so that couldn’t work. I once again waited and waited for an answer and gave up. I cannot return the printer as it is past the return deadline. I ordered an Ethernet cable and hope that will work with the laptop even though the setup does not offer that option and the manual specifically says that connecting via Ethernet is not as good as it does not allow access to all the features. As for printing from the iPhone I guess that is not possible. Could not be more disappointed by the terrible customer support and lack of information in the manual!"
"The HP DeskJet 2855e is a decent all-in-one printer for basic home use. It handles printing, scanning, and copying well, and the wireless setup is convenient once you figure it out. The print quality is fine for everyday documents, but it’s not great for photos or heavy-duty use. The 3 months of ink included is a nice perk, though the cartridges run out quickly if you print a lot. It’s compact and affordable, and you get what you pay for—it’s a solid choice for light home use but don’t expect premium performance."
"I liked that I got it 3 days earlier than the expected date. My disc drive drawer won't open so I am unable to run the disc. Best way. I went to the website and downloaded the installation program. Every printer I've ever had in 50 years asks if you want the printer to be the Primary Printer, answer Y. Do you want an icon on the tool bar, answer Y. This printer asked neither. I read setup with WiFi. I did what it said and it could find the WiFi. It's the same distance from the WiFi as the computer and it's connected. I'll uninstall it and install it again. If I fail to connect again I'll go find some kid that studied how to hook up a printer to a PC in school and have him/her do it."
It quit printing and we had to purchase the ink from them online to keep the machine going.... that's wrong!
"Decent printer for the price. Works well, easy to setup."
"If you looking for a home printer and don’t want a huge fight setting it up, buy this printer.  We were replacing our old printer and my husband had picked out something else.  The other printer came with a lot of instructions on how to unpack it and to set it up.  After fighting with the setup (which was never finished) the printer was sent back.  I on the other hand had been looking at this printer, so now it’s happy sitting on the desk next to me.  It was easy to unpack and set up.  Just install the HP software and within a few minutes, the printer was installed on my laptop and hooked into WIFI with ease.  A few more minutes it was installed on my husband’s computer and our phones.  I couldn’t be happier with this purchase.  It doesn’t take up a lot of space which is great.  It’s a little slow on the printing but that does not bother me the least bit.  It’s a fantastic printer!"
"I have tried new inks, bought a cable that connects from the printer to my laptop. It works when it feels like it."
"So far no surprises, quick set up and the app is very responsive"
Mine is for home use and works well.Great price and the quality l expect from HP.
"So I did some research and this HP Color LaserJet Pro looked nice and compact, it had some good reviews, and the price was right.  I checked it out on some YouTube videos for setup and replacing toner cartridges and everything was so simple to do.  I only use Macs and the Color LaserJet Pro was supposedly compatible with macOS.  So, I took the printer out of the box, ran the initial setup, checked the toner cartridges, put in some paper, ran the print demo, connected to my 2.4 GHz WiFi Network, and printed a one-page PDF file from my 2015 MacBook Pro in another room.  I didn't need to install any HP drivers or anything else.  The printer was instantly recognized on my network and was ready to go after a minute or so of initialization.  Now the LaserJet Pro connects and prints instantly whenever I turn it on.I have to say this printer puts out some beautiful print and it will likely be the last printer I will ever need.  I was blown away by the color-print demo.  I don't know why I waited so long to buy a decent laser printer.  I don't think this printer is expensive at all and as long as the toner cartridges stay working, I don't mind paying the price of genuine HP toner cartridges.  It will probably take me years to use up the toner in those cartridges and I even bought a spare black toner cartridge just in case.  I am honestly pleased with this Color LaserJet Pro and I highly recommend it for basic print jobs.  Printing from my Mac running Mojave OS was a breeze.  I don't think printing gets any easier than this.  I'm going to play around with it a bit, such as printing from my smartphone or my other Macs.  I basically use my MacBook Pro laptop daily to do everything, so that's all I need to print from.  I really didn't need a color laser printer, but now I have one if I ever need to print something in color.  For me, it's totally worth it if I'm going to use it for years.  The printer came in handy right away, as I need to return a corrupted PNY SSD to Amazon, so I printed the return shipment code to give to the UPS store.  I had to give this printer a 5-star rating.  I don't see any cons for the short-term.  If it keeps on working as it is, then it's perfect.I bought this Color LaserJet Pro as a replacement printer for some older crappy, multi-function HP Color-Jet printer I had been using over the past few years.  I rarely print anything, so on occasion (every few months), whenever I needed to print or copy something important, the ink-jet cartridge was either partially clogged or dried out.  That's even after I removed the ink-jet cartridges, used the nozzle cover, and placed them in plastic ZipLoc bags.  It drove me bonkers and so I decided to trash that freaking ink-jet printer.  No more ink-jets for me.  I wasn't trying to save money.  It's just that I rarely printed documents and didn't realize there was a problem with those crappy ink-jet cartridges always getting clogged no matter how carefully I treated them.  My advice is... Stay away from ink-jet printers for document printing unless you're going to use them every day."
"I will say that this printer was easy to set up, it prints quick, the print quality is amazing and it looks sleek.  There's only one thing I don't love - I find it very hard to use the envelope tray.  It's hard to get the envelope or paper in the slot.  And . . . if you don't have it in the slot right it sucks it in crooked.  Still would buy this again, but that is the one drawback I did want to mention."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I got this to replace an Epson inkjet printer that had been declining over the last few years and stopped printing most colors. This is by far the most expensive printer I've ever purchased, but I wanted a really good quality printer that would last me a long time and print reliably every time. So far, I'm really pleased.Initial Setup - I was a little concerned after reading reviews that it would take me hours and several calls to customer support to get this thing set up, but it was actually really easy. The instructions list a website to visit to download the software, so I just followed the instructions and was all set up within a few minutes. I did not need to connect the printer to any computers, I just followed the instructions and was able to get everything connected. Make sure you download the mobile and desktop apps and register on the HP Smart website, where you can manage your printer settings.Mobile App - I didn't love the idea of using a mobile app for a printer, but it is actually pretty cool. There's a lot of neat features on there, like printables, which has a bunch of free things to print, such as calendars, coloring pages, activity sheets, cards, crafts, all sorts of stuff! There's also mobile faxing and scanning, the ability to create photo books and more. I probably won't use many of these features, but I do think they are nice to have.Print Quality - I don't print a ton of stuff, but I did a few test prints and they look fantastic so far. Nice quality and clean printing.Mobile Printing - I didn't have to do anything special to print a photo from my phone. I just opened the photo on my phone, tapped the share icon, selected print, and it defaulted to the printer. It took about 30 seconds, but the quality was great on regular printer paper. You may need to keep the photo/file open until you see the print dialog on your phone show that the item is printing.Scan to Email - This was a bit challenging to set up, but I found a helpful article so I'll share how I did this. First, from the desktop HP Smart app, I added our email addresses to the address book in the scan tab. You also MUST have an outgoing email address set up in order to scan to email, so I created a Gmail account for the scanner. In the outgoing email profiles, I added this email address, used smtp.gmail.com for the server and port 465. Check the ""SMTP server requires authentication"" box and enter the email address & password. When I tested it, I got an email that Google blocked the attempt so I researched and found an article instructing to allow less secure apps and had a link (just add /settings/security/lesssecureapps to the Google URL to access this setting). I turned less secure apps on for the printer account, and that did the trick. Note that  a copy of each scan will be saved in the sent folder of that email account.2-Sided Printing - This was not the default setting on my printer, but I was able to select my default print settings from the HP Smart websiteTouchscreen - I think the touchscreen is easy to use. If setup is required for anything, it will display a message explaining exactly how to do what's needed, so that's really helpful.I've only had this printer a short time, but I'm really pleased with it so far."
Exactly what we needed. Works great. Attractive looking and well made. Has all the functions we were looking for and is sturdy and reliable.
"This printer provides the best compromise for someone who is used to the full size office printing  infrastructure but doesn't want to spend 10s of thousands of dirhams on a home printer. The set up with WiFi was very easy to do, although the app can be slightly misleading if you don't check the process carefully. The printing quality is great and is more than adequate if you just need a hard copy to read instead of staring at something on a screen for hours. Colour quality is also excellent and photos come out great. Overall, it's an excellent home printer that scans and copies quickly too."
"The printer was purchased for my wife to use with her business. She had issues and simply would not use it; she kept going back to an older HP Printer that had its own set of issues but printed better than this. So, there were a small number of print jobs on it when I decided to see what was going on. I should have done this sooner. I saw that there were serious print issues that I could not resolve. So, I contacted HP Support, and they went through things with me. In the end, they shipped a replacement printer.All is well with the replacement printer. Excellent print quality, and scan quality. All is well and I highly recommend, as always, HP Printers. The most important feature of a purchase is support, and I must say that HP excelled in this area."
"Due to some not so good reviews I was a bit skeptical about getting this printer, however my gut instinct told me to get itI’m glad I did! This printer works really well, it does it all even print photos. I’ve put this printer thru the ringer and it’s so good. The price was fair, there’s no paper jam, no error messages, and the quality of the color is excellent! Speed not bad at all, remember this is a HP printer not a Concorde…"
"HP has gone from a leader in printers to junk dealer from the physical printer itself, to the install, to the tech support, to the entire spectrum of what they could do wrong. If I had simply ignored all their instructions and help, especially the ""HP SMART"" software,  I would have likely had this setup and working within 30 minutes.  However, the setup guide said ""install the REQUIRED HP Smart software"" (it was in bold in the instructions).  It was a confusing, complicated, install that was mostly a hard hard sell for instant ink and kept requiring me to give info.  It never gave me any opportunity to give my own name to the printer, my own IP address, turn off feature such as Wi-Fi direct.  When I called the HP support it went from an automated voice insisting I give my serial number and not finding it thus dropping me.  Going online and entering my just activated serial number from a package I received today to something that has already lost two months of warranty? WTF? And now I supposed to provide evidence that I just got it? Doesnt the fact the serial number was just activated prove that.  I was dropped not once but twice after calling tech support.  After going thru at least 4 separate phone calls, I finally got a tech who said I didnt need to install the allegedly required HP SMART and could have set it up from the screen, download he few drivers, used the embedded web service, and did it all easily.  So after cleaning it all off, reconfiguring to my needs, and thinking I am all done, the HP Support goes down so now I cant even download drivers.  I have an HP Laserjet 4 built in 1995 (yes 1995) that still works fine.  I had a Office Jet Pro that lasted 10 years (which you couldnt even get a repair manual for).  I then bought another Office Jet Pro that worked fine for 5 years and then the printhead died and they dont make the part for it.  Now I have this one which I cant even get to work.  All HP wants to do is sell cheap printers and expensive ink.  I will never purchase another HP productPS: Even after an additional half dozen phone calls, my hardware warranty was put to the proper place but inexplicably is now set back to original incorrect date.  I have returned the product and am now using an old canon printer"
"Printer is easy to set up, easy to use, very fast! The only thing is I tried to print on cardstock and the ink wouldn’t show."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I was worried about this printer because there were so many bad reviews but I had no problems what so ever setting it up. I scanned the QR that came up after I powered on the printer and I already had the app on my phone from my old printer so that was easy. It found my internet and connected the printer quickly. The printer did have an update so that took a couple of minutes but after that I was able to add the printer to my computer, again through the HP Smart app and it printed my documents beautifully. It’s a bit loud but no louder than any other home printer I’ve had. The color is perfect and it printed quickly. I choose not to do the instant ink trial after reading the reviews on that but it let me decline with no problems. So far I would recommend but it’s only my first day. Will try to come back with an update later on."
"All the features work as expected, but the best part is the fantastic photos!"
"Trashed my Epson Ecotank after 14 months of frustrations. Never should have tried Epson, so happy to be back with HP. This is how I expect a printer to work!"
"I should have bought this one in the first place, all applications work well and the setup was a breeze, just have to figure out why when I press the scan to computer option on the printer display it brings up the w11 scanner option and not the HP option, if you launch the hp option from pc it works better gives you the ADP or glass option for scanning. Like all printer ink is expensive so if you print a lot opt for the instant ink option"
"I recently started using the HP Envy Inspire 7955e All-in-One Printer, and I’m delighted with its performance. This printer not only meets but surpasses my expectations with its high-quality output and versatile functionality.Setting up the printer was a breeze, and the print quality is excellent, whether I’m printing documents, photos, or creative projects. The addition of the HP+ Instant Ink bonus for three months is a fantastic perk, ensuring I never run out of ink unexpectedly and saving on printing costs.The all-in-one capabilities are incredibly convenient; the printer handles scanning, copying, and printing with ease, making it a valuable addition to my home office. The wireless connectivity is reliable, and the mobile printing options make it easy to send documents from anywhere.Overall, the HP Envy Inspire 7955e has proven to be a reliable and efficient printer, offering great value with the Instant Ink subscription. It’s an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-performance, multifunction printer. Highly recommended!"
Over the last 40 years I have always bought HP Printers. This one is a beauty so light does everything the Manual says it does and oh so quietly. Best printer I have ever owned. Thank you HP!
I've only printed 5 pages that were grey shaded...printed as bluish.  Now printer says nearly empty for coloured ink.  What's going on?  I really like the printer otherwise.
"got this printer.opened box and followed instructions. was unable to open the "" cartridge door"". turns out the "" printer door has to be closed to open the cartridge door.This was resolved after chatting with the HP mobile support team.There could be a little note or focus put on this in the video presentation that accompanies the printer.Anyways, printer works great. happy with purchase... ( outside of the frustration related to set up and video chat!... if you ever do need the video chat support from HP, I will say that it is fabulous!)"
"I ordered the HP 3201 DW and so far it has met my expectations.  I upgraded to a laser printer for my home office needs and after reading the pros and cons, I took a chance on this model and after a week, I have to say things are going well. The colors are vibrant, the printing is quick and relatively quiet. I have an IMac so the setup was instant and easy.  I plugged it in, my wife hit a few buttons and wah-lah .. wifi printing.  No HP downloads and it even works with Samsung.  I print directly from my Samsung cell phone with no challenges at all. I am pleased with the delivery, ease of use, quality, size, price and appearance. This is supposedly the ""newer"" version and I did purchase the extended warranty just in case."
"I purchased this used like new from Amazon, saved a few bucks but you never know what quality the items might be buying used.  The box had been opened and there was printer paper in the drawer but not many copies had been made according to the toner levels.  I did a factory reset so I could start setting up from scratch and then did a firmware update.  I sent an Amazon webpage from my ipad to the printer once setup on our wifi, wow, the print quality is so much better than the HP 8610 pro I replaced this with, outstanding colors and the paper didn‚Äôt wilt like with the liquid printers I have had.  I sent an HD picture from my ipad to the printer, it is amazing how the colors are so real, very happy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so far so good with this color laser printer!"
"It is borderline unusable over wifi.Easy to setup, easy to use, print quality is fine as well. Plug it in, connect it to wifi, add it to your laptop or phone, print. Easy. Everything works fine the first time.However next time you try to print anything from the laptop or the phone nothing will work. It will say ""printer is offline"" and after that, no matter what you do to it, there is no reliable way to refresh its status and force it to print anything. Reboot the printer - doesn't matter, says ""offline"", reboot the laptop - doesn't matter, ""offline"". Re-connect the printer to wifi, doesn't matter - ""offline"".The stupidest thing is that when you open the HP app on the same laptop the app does see the printer and recognizes it as online. Shows you the status, the toner level. But you can't print anything, print queue and print dialogs say it's offline.Then randomly after a few minutes (or a lot of minutes, it's random) it would get recognized as online again and you would be able to print. Until you pause for some period and it becomes offline again. Repeat.There are ""troubleshooting"" steps like making a default printer, some other similar suggestions. They help maybe once, after the period of inactivity you will be back at square one, everything will say it's offline. And at that point it's already a default printer and all troubleshooting steps performed. Nothing helps.Same when printing from the phone. Trying to add it from the print dialog works the first time. Next times it would say offline. Sometimes it would randomly recognize it as online after a few minutes of staring at the print dialog. But sometimes it wouldn't. When you try to add it over wifi direct it would work the first time. But then again, next time it's offline. And if you remove and attempt to add it again - good luck, the phone would find it but you won't be able to install it.Or you can install HP smart app and whatever other apps it requires to print from the phone. It won't see the printer. But then after you lose the patience and go back to the print dialog, it would be available in the dialog using the HP plugin. What is going on.....Doesn't matter the OS either. MacOS, Windows, Android - same things. Doesn't matter the wifi quality, gone through multiple routers, different bands, through other different settings, and currently sitting right next to it on the same network, unable to print anything but able to do everything else over the same wifi.I dread the next time I need to print anything, I will need to go over all possible combinations of random actions that I think are related. I feel like I am following a cargo cult, where I need to perform some weird dance and press random things in hope that the pinter gods will allow me to send the PDF over and I would get it on a paper by some magic.How hard it is to implement a reliable working wifi printer driver?"
"I was tired of my laser jet printed pages smearing if they got damp, etc. I decided to try this Laserjet printer and am so glad I did! I have had it for over a year now and am really impressed with its performance and print quality. I buy the high yield cartridges and am impressed with how easy they are to install and replace. Just pull out a tray, remove the spent cartridge by lifting it out, and pop in a new one. Once the tray is reinserted it will go trough a short cycle to get the cartridge ready and to calibrate. We have had minimal issues with connectivity, paper jams, or other technical issues. I did need to reconnect the printer to our router once or twice, but it is easy to do. It seems to go through walls well. My husband‚Äôs office is across the house and in in the back from mine but he connects just fine. Paper is easy to change sizes or to refill. The print quality is so much better than my old HP Officejet!! The only con for me is the high cost of the proprietary cartridges, but that is part of the cost of owning a LaserJet. I have replaced the black toner twice and two of the color ones twice in the past 15 months but your mileage will vary depending on how much you print. I do plan to start another business this fall so I know I will use more toner and paper once that happens.I do recommend that you buy a full set of high yield cartridges to keep on hand as the cartridges that come with the printer do not last that long. When one color or black cartridge is spent, I order another spare for the next time to keep on hand as the colors run out at different times. There is a newer model I see but if the price is good do not hesitate to buy this one."
"I had previously purchase (kinda sorta) same; my mistake not seeing clearly it was not a colored printer. So I found THIS one. Great reviews! Home office. Set up was a bit challenging without the onscreen (touch screen) but fairly doable to do manually. Boom thought all was good for one week. Went to print again and asked to log in (again); wifi not connected (again) but ok, I had not printed in 5 days so perhaps it did not quite connect. (what do I know...); tried again and still nothing; turn off, turn on, reset. frustrating. They saw an alert; ""you may have run out of toner"" really? One week? and (toner) low? But ok, perhaps I was sent a printer that isn't up to par for making a mistake ordering original. Now trying to buy a toner. No guidance (this is the toner you need for the printer you just purchased) - which makes me weary to buy and make another mistake. Other than that, when it prints, it prints nicely. #twocents"
It has been the best purchase for a printer.
it works - exactly what i need from it
We installed this as a second home printer. I LOVE the black and white laser.It is fast and cheap. This one even does automatic duplex printing to save paper.The B&W is fine for us. We ran through so many color cartridges over the years when my wife printed out recipes or craft ideas. The B&W is fine for us--and so much cheaper. The cartridges last us probably over a year.We have not tried the envelopes function. Easy connection via the HP setup process.Make sure to put the printer on the same WiFi as the laptops/smartphones/iPads in the house. We have a WiFi repeater that we use for better coverage--you have to make sure they are all on the same network.
"Works great, easy set up."
"I purchased this product in August, 2023.  Shortly after the return window closed I started having trouble with the wifi feature.  There isn't a display screen to work with so everything is a guessing game.  This week the lights went out and I haven't been able to turn it on.  The quality of the printing was good when you could get it to print, but I finally had to use a print cable because it would randomly disconnect from our wifi.  I don't recommend this product."
"I have this set up on local network. My desktop (wired connection) has no issue in printing to it. Our laptop (Wireless) will print to it with no problem.For some reason, it would print an extra page with just ""PDF"" on it. HP Support suggested unplugging it, holding down the power button for 15 seconds, and reconnecting / restarting. That resolved the issue.Minor Suggestion - You can go into the Printer Preferences and change it to ""Economode"" and save toner."
"I used a MacBook Pro to configure WiFi printing. Put paper in printer and pushed the power button. However the paper jam light stayed on. When I downloaded and ran smarthp program it would not find the printer  probably because paper jam light was on. I removed the paper tray and reinserted it. This time the paper jam light was not on. I was then able to see the printer. The rest of the installation was fine. I opted to not use the hp cloud printing. The print quality, speed, and WiFi connectivity are great. Unlike my old hp printer, it‚Äôs always connected to my network. No more having to restart the printer because you can‚Äôt see it on the network."
My boss bought this for me and I love it!  Quite and quick!
"I have this sitting on an island counter, so wifi for me is a must. Quite a workhorse of a printer."
"This is generally a good printer with sharp print quality, no jams yet after 2 months. But like others, I have had frequent issues with it going offline and not being findable by my computer -- not by wifi, not even when it plug it straight into my Mac.  I've got all the drivers etc updated, still the same problem.  It happens every week or two, seemingly at random, and just takes endless restarts and reinstalls before it'll come back again. This is clearly a software problem, and HP really needs to get on top of it."
"Printer works decently, the setup was quite easy, the print quality is good and the toner page yield is fairly decent. I wish it had an inbuilt scanner. Nonetheless, I would recommend for a home office or small business. I‚Äôve had the printer for a month but i will edit this if any changes after 6months."
"Very basic black & white printing, exactly what I need.Easy set up on Wifi"
