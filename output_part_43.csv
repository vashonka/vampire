Comfort and price are in perfect balance
Perfect üëç
"I have been a Teva guy for 30+ years now.  I have tried the clones because Teva are overpriced and always come back to Teva.  I have tried alternatives such as Keenes and always come back to Teva.  Even with Teva, I get the buckle version ($$$) because I find that the Velcro wears out before the sandal wears out and the buckle eliminates this failure.  And when I come back, I always wince at the cost but realize I am getting more when I pay more.  They are more comfortable, they last longer, they are simply better even though the prices are higher.My last pair of buckle Teva just fell apart.  Not the Velcro, not the buckle, not the soles, the straps.  Maybe I got a bad pair and these simply wore out sooner?  Whatever; it has left a bad taste in my mouth for what Teva charges that they have reduced quality to where the straps fall apart when they charge so much.So I tried the clone again.  It didn't fit right, I returned it.  So here I am again, buying Teva...  They just fit better, they are more comfortable, and if they are cost-cutting and reducing quality (they don't wear like they used to), I will continue to try alternatives.  However, credit where credit is due, I sucked it up and paid for the Teva."
"I bought these sandals for my husband to use during summer activities, and they‚Äôve been perfect! He says they're incredibly comfortable and provide great support for all-day wear. They‚Äôre also stylish and durable, handling everything from beach trips to hiking with ease. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a reliable pair of summer sandals!"
"These are very well made sandals, especially for the price. They fit well and are comfortable .I have had two pair previously and they last several years every time. These are the only sandals I would ever buy."
"I have owned Tevas for some years now and I will continue to buy them. The fit is comfortable and they work well on both land and water.Having said that, I will note that the slab of material that forms the tread is glued to the slab of material that forms the sole.  This is the point of eventual failure - the glue gives out. This is usually around the third season and is why I knock off a star."
"Teva Sandals - what needs to be said? Excellent value and durability. Highly recommended for wearing as shower shoes, walking on the beach, or wearing into the surf in rocky areas."
"My old pair finally had to be thrown away after 30 years.  30 years!!  The velcro failed long ago, but I still managed to wear them.  These are just as good, if not better."
"I still have an old version of this sandal that I bought decades ago and have worn for many things over the years. I like the old pair so well I keep doing minor repairs and still use them as my ""yard shoes"". I've tried a couple of other brands since that purchase but they don't compare to the Teva. I thought it was time to try Teva again in search of that comfort and adjustability I had known for so long. I was pleasantly surprised that the new sandals are much like my originals and just as comfortable, I'm very happy with them. If they hold-up as well as my last pair I'll likely never need to buy another pair of sandals."
"After years of wearing a pair of Chacos that I never liked (the toe strap ALWAYS tightens during use and I hate the feeling of my toe being restrained!), I decided to just try a pair of Tevas. They're kind of everything I've been looking for. They are comfortable, easy to throw on when I need to get out the door quickly, and they don't look *too* goofy. Hope to get many years of enjoyment out of these bad boys."
"I got these to replace my original same sandals of 25 years. The best period. My go-to hot weather wear, easy to slip on and off while being indestructible. Recycle those flip flops."
They look and fit perfect
Own 5 pairs of Teva. Will buy again.
"These are my favorite Amazon purchase of all summer. They are the most comfortable sandal I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve ever worn and are so cute! I was worried about the quality, but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s great! I wore them all summer long and they held up and still look good. The straps are adjustable because I had to make them snugger when I got them. I wore them once for 8 hours and my feet felt supported all day long."
I love these sandals! I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m a women‚Äö√Ñ√¥s aize 8 and I bought these in the 8/8.5 size range and they fit perfectly! I was concerned with the comfortability of these but I was pleasantly surprised with how they felt! The little bit of platform makes them a bit girlie but also still super casual so they are very versatile sandals.They come in many different colors but I was happy with my black pair because I can wear them with anything.I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve only had them for a couple of weeks but they seem like a pretty durable pair of sandal for that price point!Even my 14 year old thinks they are cute!Definitely would purchase again and I recommend them if you want a simple but cute pair of sandals!
Bought them for easy on and off for gym days since I need to wear grip socks and they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re not comfy with regular sneakers. They are comfy and stylish.
"Love these cute and comfy slides for casual wear. But they are slippery when wet and will easily tear if your foots slides through. They are true to size, quiet, and a good value."
"I bought these for my go to summer shoes! Great quality, light weight. Run true to size. And great value for your money!"
These are so cute and comfortable! I wear a size 9 and it fits perfect with the 9 I chose.
!! Update 9/10/2024: wore them to the beach over the weekend and ended up with killer blisters on the top of both feet due to the rubbing so docked down two stars.. plus side is they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re still lightweight just not as comfortable as the first couple times I wore them8/31/2024: Finally decided to order these after months of looking at it and i don't regret it! They're actually so light and comfy that i forgot i was wearing these little platform sandals; almost twisted my ankle a couple times  because of that bahaha.
"I like to wear shoes around the house since I walk hard, my heal will hurt if I don't.  These have enough cushion that I can wear them everyday and no pain.  They are a little stiff in the beginning, but worked through it."
"Very comfortable.  I‚Äôve have several pairs of Chaco‚Äôs & OluKais. They are very similar in some area  & different in others. 1 Similar in arch, while a bit more stiff with the sole. 2 The sole on the OluKais are more cushioned and seem to bend more easily.  The Chaco soles are more firm and less flexible. While both have well supported lugs. 3 They stay on.  Both have a strap the is far back enough in the foot where, like most flip flops, they do not require a lot of toe curl to hold on to the flip flop so you don‚Äôt walk out of them. 4 I try to remain disciplined enough to walk a few miles each morning. There is nothing like a summer morning walk in ‚Äúflippies.‚Äù I can‚Äôt make it a mile in the Chico's before I start blistering. I don‚Äôt have an issue with OluKais. The straps are softer and the soles more flexible. In consideration of the pros and cons, to me, the winner, given the ones I have tried, and my personal favorite is OluKai! Every pair if tried is more comfortable than other shoes or remaining barefoot and more comfortable than anything else I can remember wearing.Size is true for me despite the reviews saying they run small.  I think it has something to do with your toe length. They look great.  Fit great. Day one, during the break-in. I walked over a mile in them without issues. These are pretty fancy flippies, so I‚Äôm not likely to do a long walk with them. I‚Äôll wear my older OluKais for that, but these are a joy to wear.  Another 30+ miles this week in my Ohana OluKais this week.OluKai knows and gets my feet and earned my business!!!  Sorry Chacos. My feet have spoken!?"
"I've tried many others, from Rainbow to Hurley. I doubt I'll ever buy another brand again. They are so durable, the soles are comfortable and sturdy and have so many color, material, and styles. As soon as I put my foot in them, I was impressed with how nice they felt."
"So comfortable, sizing does run a little small. I usually wear a 12 but 13s are a perfect fit in this brand. This is my third pair and will purchase them again after these wear out."
"It's hard to describe the feeling of having your feet into them but it feels GOOOOOD!!!1. I usually wear a 10 in all my sandals and size up to 11 in these, they fit perfect!! Happy I made the right decision to size up2. It's true that the sole may be a little bit harder than all my reefs but still it outclass all of them in terms of comfort and feeling good factor. You have to wear them to really get this feeling of comfort and quality.3. I have 4 reefs high end models going and this Okulai Tuahine outclass them all and it is my favourite.4. I am a happy client that will be crossing the bridge to 100% Okulai in the future.. Will be buying the Ohana and Ulele that will be on my next list5. Quality is outstanding and seems that they will be very durable. Will update on it sometimes in the future.Conclusion: I was hesitant to buy the tuahine due to the price but I am so happy that I decided to try them. In my opinion, it is worth it and money well spent."
"Really durable, sturdy, beach ready shoes. Definitely be careful about blisters and stuff when you first break them in, but once they mold to your feet they are AMAZING!"
Order 1 size up. Comfortable. Expensive. Would have liked explanation for the various different types of sandals they make
I have worn a lot of different brands of flip flops over the years. These are probably the best I have had. They are comfortable and look great. I like that the sole is tough enough to walk on gravel without feeling the gravel through the bottom.
"I have ""low volume"" (narrow-ish) feet. Most flip-flops are waaay too loose for me. Olukai has a good reputation, so I bought and tried several, not really expecting much difference since they're all the same company.The Ulele sandals, the newer synthetic (rubber) model, were cushy but uncomfortable. They tore up the sides of my feet.The Ohana (older rubber model) is a lot more comfortable than the Ulele, but a bit aggressive with the molding (arch). And even though they feel a bit loose, they aren't coming off; the shape works well.These, the Tuahine, have a leather footbed, and are both secure without being overly snug and are very comfortable. I actually find them more comfortable than bare foot."
"As good as was expected, fit very well and comfortable to walk in."
"Fast shipping, High quality, and sturdy materials. However, they delivered incorrect shoe size."
Fits at least one size small.
"Cute, durable, lightweight, and comfortable! I‚Äôm a teacher so I am on my feet all day and these definitely hold up!"
Cute and Comfortable. Great price!
"These shoes are pretty comfortable. Due to lack of cushioning on the soles, it's not something I'd be able to wear while out all day, but it's great for shorter errands. I have semi wide feet and normally wear 8 1/2 to 9. I ordered size 9 and they fit perfectly. The straps are very soft and comfortable. I have sensitive feet (just returned two other pairs of shoes because the straps irritated my skin), but these straps feel great. Unfortunately, they are a little hard for me to walk in - I feel like my foot kept sliding around. I‚Äôm used to wearing slide style sandals and have never had this problem before, so I‚Äôm not sure why this is happening."
"Love, love, love these sandals! Not only are they adorable (and have great colors that go with everything!), but they‚Äôre SO comfortable and fit my foot perfectly (definitely true to size). So far they‚Äôve held up well and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I am on my feet all day and literally never want to take these off. They‚Äôre way more comfortable than many other pairs of sandals I‚Äôve had/tried. I love them so much I bought another pair and am so glad I did!"
"These little shoes have padding in the sole and they are so cute on. The strap is not very stretchy, but gives a little bit. I would size up if you have wide feet. They are very lightweight and the quality I great for the price! A nice find on Amazon!"
Very cute and comfortable sandals however they run small. I wear a size 8 in sandals and these did not fit. Should‚Äôve ordered an 8 1/2.
I been looking for a pair of sandals just like these and they fit perfectly and are very comfortable
"I am a sucker for some flat quick cute Sandles.These are perfect for the summer. They can be dressed up and down. Haven‚Äôt worn in me yet and I‚Äôve worn them all summer long. Simple, light and cute. As you wear them the get less stiff"
This is a great sandal. For the price! They look great and are somewhat cushioned.  Not an all day walking sandal but super comfy for reg use!
My children laugh at these so not sure how fashionable they are but they are so comfy. I actually use them as indoor shoes instead of slippers.Not sure how strong they would be for  lot of use by someone heavy footed but they do the job I want them to do.
"I recently purchased the Naturalizer Women's Baylor Heeled Sandal in gold for my daughter‚Äôs high school homecoming, and I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with my choice!**Style and Elegance:**These heels are absolutely stunning! The gold color adds a touch of elegance that perfectly complements her homecoming dress. The design is chic and stylish, making them the ideal accessory for such a special occasion.**Comfort:**What truly impressed me is how comfortable they are. My daughter was able to wear them throughout the evening without any discomfort, which is a huge win for a high school dance. The wide fit provided great support, allowing her to dance and enjoy the night without worrying about her feet.**Versatility:**I can also see these heels being perfect for other events, from family gatherings to summer outings. They‚Äôre versatile enough to be dressed up or down, which makes them a great addition to her wardrobe.Overall, the Naturalizer Baylor Heeled Sandal exceeded our expectations. My daughter felt beautiful and confident, and I‚Äôm thrilled with this purchase. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable option for special occasions!"
"LOVE the style and perfect height for comfort, true to size and nude color. Worth the price"
They are plain but very very comfortable. I danced all night at my friend‚Äôs wedding and they held up really well. I have bunions and these were very comfortable.
I had almost stopped wearing heels after having issues with my lower back. Tried Naturalizer shoes for the first time. This fits well and is very comfy. Not giving 5 stars since I noticed it can get slippery on smooth surfaces.
"I originally bought the wide size because all the shoes I tried on in 5 different stores were so tight. But I ended up swapping for the regular and was extremely happy. They are comfy, cute and a good price. I wore them for a wedding and kept them on all night. Will definitely be getting in more colors!"
"Naturalizer is my favorite go to heeled shoes. This was the first time I had to return a pair because one shoe was wider than the other. It was not only uncomfortable but also noticeable. Both shoes were my size and not a wide width. Just recommending you try on both shoes and make sure they both fit properly. Always recommend this brand, as they run true to size, and are comfortable enough to wear all day."
"To be honest, I was very happy with these shoes when I first put them on. They felt sturdy and the construction was well-made: the sole was pretty comfy, and the footbed contoured very nicely to my foot. I walked in them perfectly. However, it was my mistake to not have broken them in a little before wearing them for a wedding I attended. I didn't realize how much the straps would rub on my toes and give me blisters. Now, granted I danced a lot, and drank a lot, and was in these shoes for hours - probably 11 hours. So I really put my feet through it in these shoes. Needless to say, my toes became riddled with massive blisters that I had to go to the doctor days after the wedding for - because those blisters became infected. (Try keeping your feet clean when you can only wear flip-flops due to blisters and it's raining outside.)Anyway, this is a mixed review on the shoe because the injury is partially my fault, and partially the design of the shoe. Get them if you only plan to be in them for a short while and you don't have fat toes that spread out and want to join the party. But if you can't do strappy heels, do NOT buy. They're pretty but not for me."
"Never been much of a heel wearer. My feet always hurt after a short period of time. I wore these to a wedding and lasted 6 hours before I started to feel some discomfort. Even then it still wasn‚Äôt too bad. I am plus size and have wide feet. I am in shock how amazing these heels are and stylish too. I don‚Äôt know what it is about the shoe but they are amazing and I will definitely try other styles of this brand, because I have never found a more comfortable heel to wear."
"As usual with Naturalizer, they are so comfortable and they look very nice"
"Likes: Quality, fit, comfort, style, heel hight, and material.Dislikes: N/A"
"These are surprisingly comfy. I wore them at Bonnaroo right after I got them and didn‚Äôt have any issues with blisters or discomfort. They are rubber so I hope they hold up over time but ive had them about 6 months so far. They also make me a bit taller, which I like!"
"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this but I love these shoes! I have NEVER owned Crocs because, let‚Äôs be real, the original ones you see people wearing all the time are just plain horrendous. But I saw these on a travel blog and with an upcoming two-week trip to Europe, I thought I‚Äôd get a pair to try out.Over the course of these two weeks, I wore them on multiple tours averaging between 10,000 to 23,000 steps per day and my feet never hurt! Surprisingly amazing arch support, easy to pack, great fit, easily adjustable, easy to put on, easy to clean and super cute - no one would ever guess that they‚Äôre by Crocs. They‚Äôre cute enough to dress up with dresses and jumpsuits or dress down with shorts. Perfect for a super hot summer in Europe.I would totally recommend them to anyone and these have definitely changed my mind about Crocs‚Ä¶.but I still won‚Äôt be buying any of the original ones tho!"
Wore these on a cruise. Lots of walking. Very comfortable and went with pants and dresses.
"I've been wearing Crocs exclusively for many many years. All kinds of sandals. Thick heels and more flat ones. Experience is that the thicker heels like these, never even let me feel the bone spur in my heel! These shoes are perfect fit at my normal size and such a plus to have adjustable straps on the ankles (one ankle swells a bit). What I did notice is that the shoes look much narrower and pretty on my feet. I have not worn them a full day and will update after. LOVE THEM!"
"Overall - Seemed super comfortable and durable, but appear to run short length-wise. Loved the closure at the ankle!These shoes were so cute and were just as comfortable as I anticipated they would be. The ankle closure was also really easy to do up since it wasn't a traditional buckle type, which I loved! The ankle strap is adjustable and felt secure, but the over the foot straps were a little large for my narrow feet and not adjustable. I ordered my regular size, but I sadly had to return because they were a bit short for my foot. I would have replaced with a half size, but they are only in whole sizes, and since the across the foot straps are not adjustable I was concerned that a whole size up would be too loose on my narrower feet."
Love how comfortable these were while also being cute! everyone was so shocked these were CROCS! Perfect for wedding vendors!
"i hate shoe shopping as a size 11 woman with flat feet and issues with plantar fasciitis in the past. but sometimes i'm on my feet for 8 hour+ days for work. i have these shoes in multiple colors - and the croc flats as well - they are my daily go to shoes. they can be dressed up or down and are super comfortable. they're also pretty quiet and don't made any ""farting"" noises when you walk around (which is something i have had issues with having flat feet!)"
"I love these shoes!  They are like walking in clouds and have good arch support which I absolutely have to have. I have been paying over a $100 for another brand that seems to have lowered their quality and don‚Äôt hold up like they used to. I am so happy to have found a sandal that will be durable, affordable and give my problem feet the support I need for my busy life."
"I bought these because of an upcoming trip where I need to be able to walk easily for 4-5 km daily AND look dressy too on several occasions . These are perfect. They are CROCS so you know you can count on arch support and those little bumps that make your whole foot feel great. I bought the full black (sole and top) for a dressier look. These are super comfortable and I just don‚Äôt want to take them off! Waterproof to boot! Just a note to buy larger than you think you need. I went on the Crocs website and it warns that this model runs small. That is so true. I usually need 7-7.5 in shoes so I bought an 8 and they fit PERFECTLY. Highly recommended. ADDED LATER: I am a fit senior and I took these on a trip to Vancouver Island last week. On my last day there, I did 30,664 steps in them one day on varied terrain: beach, trail, street. And yet, no blisters, no sore spots, amazing. They got wet at one point (ocean) and full of sand, and they kept on going--they are 100% waterproof. Really quite an incredible shoe design."
"I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t believe I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m writing a review on socks but honestly, good ones are hard to find.These are so soft, comfortable, not too think and not too thin. They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re not weirdly see thru like some socks I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve purchased in the past from Amazon. They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re also the perfect height on the ankle."
"Thick, comfy and true to size"
"Hanes few inches about ankle socks. I have other white Hanes socks and they are thinner than these, I like both versions. These however are more loose fitting and WA winter ready. Very comfy! They do not slip down! Weight is med-thick. Quality is great. Better than the thinner version of the white above ankle ones which are tight."
"I was looking for low, cotton ankle socks.  These are perfect.  They cover my ankles and keep my feet warm and dry.  I would recommend them for any athletic use."
These socks are perfect for the colder seasons because they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re a little thick and soft on the inside. I really liked the feel of these socks and the quality that I will be buying more!
"The price of these socks is nice and affordable. Not only that, but the quality is great too. They might pill a little but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not horrible in my experience. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been wearing these socks for 7 months now and love them. They are not too thin to where they feel icky and like they might tear, but not so thick that they make your shoes fit differently. They are soft and comfortable, even just to wear around the house and lounge in, and the crew cut is perfect. I will keep buying these for the unforseeable future whenever I need socks!"
"These socks are great for your money! They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re cushioned which is nice but not a great fit for athletic use since they slip and slide a bit.But for around the house or to the grocery store, they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re the bomb!"
I got these socks on sale and such a bang for my buck. They are so soft and fit great! Usually socks run tighter on me but these fit perfect and are roomy. I washed them before wearing and they are perfect
"got these as a dupe for the TNA/aritizia socks. they look the same when worn with shoes (the cuff part around the ankle). these are super comfy socks!i now have the TNA pairs and the fit is definitely different, but looks wise is a good substitute"
