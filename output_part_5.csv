"Been using it about a month, now - solid build, provides a good fit, and a good value overall."
"This drone is awesome! It will do things I haven't even figured out yet. The pictures and videos are amazing. I love this thing. Very well constructed. Amazon had the best price and you could even make 0% interest payments was offered. It is the most fun, and best serious, flying machine I've ever had. If you need to make any observations from the air this is the machine to use. The controls are very sensitive yet responsive. With the collision avoidance system you would have to intentionally crash it. It keeps you from doing stupid stuff. The controller is amazing with so much information and clear pictures of what the drone is doing and it's location. You get into a sticky situation let go of the controls and it comes to a stop so you can get your bearings before you move again. It's awesome!"

Received FLYMORE package today from Amazon October7, 2023. Ordered last night around 8pm and received package around 10am… Fast!  Like many “Precious or delicate” items ordered from Amazon I got the typical box nearly twice the size of the box inside… usually not a problem unless it’s the typical box twice the size of the box inside with ZERO bubble wrap, air pack, or crumbled paper you SHOULD have to protect the nearly 1800$ box inside, so yeah, Cool…. Thanks Amazon for the I don’t “care package”!  And wouldn’t you know… the DJI box had a dent on the bottom of it, just what you want to see when you spend your hard earned money or in my case charged, using the 12mo. Financing and haven’t even made my first payment yet….come on Amazon!, you make way too much money to cut corners and have no excuses.On to the drone…. Unboxed and items seem to be ok thanks to the great packaging by DJI utilizing the nice carrying bag as it’s packaging insulation.I have everything opened up and ready, and the power bank charger cable is due to arrive in a few days. The point in starting this in real time review is that I figured I’d go ahead and plug the USB c charger into the average standard charging outlet at least so I can potentially fly before the arrival of the power bank charger… however I plugged it in shortly before 11am and it’s now 9pm as of writing this and Not even the first battery is at 3 bars than it dawned on me that my MacBook Pro had a USB c power bank charger, and sure enough.. I plugged it in and the speed went from Snail to rapid and within 30 minutes it finished the first and now 3/4 the way on the 2nd battery. This is what compelled me to start the review earlier for those that want to save a few bucks and happen to have a newer MacBook Pro with the same output range charger, before doing so however double check the specs of the DJI version and your current one first for the same or similar “safe” output V/A.This is my first DJI drone, I’ve had many, I can already tell that without even flying it yet that the build quality has surpassed all but one 10k cinema drone that’s out of my budget, so I’m eager to fly and thus far impressed with what I see from DJI.That’s it for now, weather permitting i will check back in with updates, as the journey begins…. And with fingers crossed hopefully the journey ends well too.Happy flying!Update-12/29/23The drone is absolutely amazing, I have been on several trips and the footage is bar none the best!  I haven’t had any lag which you see in most below average drones constantly which really is what causes you to crash, so this is exceptional as you won’t be flying into a stray object unless you’re not paying attention.The obstacle avoidance is great but keep in mind it will NOT pick up objects with little definition… limbs with no leaves are a nemesis…. So high alert if flying near them.All in all I’ve been so impressed with the quality of DJI, since this purchase I went in to buy the pocket 3, the mini pro 4 fly more, the DJI dual mics, the iPhone gimbal, the ronin 3 pro gimbal and so on, I’m blessed to be able to do so. The company and products are great! And I needed a core company and product line to wrap around for my upcoming ventures.I can see them entering the Full Frame or cinema style Camera scene soon and if so, I will take the leap, until then I’m with my Nikon for that.I hope to see Major upgrades to the software App side however, that is one of two weakness that should be noted of DJI as whole that I’ve spotted thus far… the second is important as well, and that is the “Intelligent battery” system  doesn’t seem to be intelligent enough to maintain the batteries power, so do make sure you top off batteries if they have sat idle for days or weeks, as they do lose power.  I was a bit disappointed with this however I purchased the 2 yr extended plans on all the devices and if they fall short I will be filing a claim on those in particular.No other issues thus far… as of this update, absolutely buy this if you’re on the fence.  The quality and experience are top notch! Attached a vid and few photos, not sure of what quality they’ll display but on my end they’re on point.See you soon for another update!"
"Air 3 has completely transformed my aerial cinematographer experience. As a filmmaker, I rely on the latest technology to capture unique, breathtaking visuals.One aspect I particularly appreciate is the ease of integrating this drone into my existing workflow. With the two cameras, ND filters, and upgraded sensor, it allows me to achieve even higher production value in my footage. It's now easier to match it with the footage from other cameras we use in production. The compatibility and versatility of the drone make it an indispensable tool for my aerial cinematography projects.Cinematic FootageThe dual primary cameras equipped with 70 mm medium telephoto and wide-angle lenses deliver exceptional image quality. The footage is sharp, vibrant, and cinematic, truly enhancing the storytelling element of my work. Whether I'm shooting landscapes, action sequences, or establishing shots, the image quality never fails to impress.Active TrackAir 3 offers a wide range of flight modes - Active track, focus track, QuickShots and more. I mostly use the ActiveTrack mode for smoothly tracking subjects, and the Waypoint mode for precise path planning. Overall, this provides the versatility needed to capture shots with precision and creativity.Extended control rangeAir 3 control range is up to 20 kilometers. That's pretty impressive. I can escape the limitations of traditional equipment and plan shooting from remote locations.In conclusion, Air 3 is a powerful tool.  It is not in par with more advanced drones like Mavic 3 Pro, but still provides cinematic image quality, versatile flight modes, and longer range. If you're a beginner filmmaker or looking to switch from older models, this drone os definitely the one to consider."
"As an enthusiast, this is everything I ever wanted in a drone. Easy to use, fantastic safety features, and top-notch video and photo quality. Can't go wrong with the Air 3"
"I already own the mini 4 pro but wanted something that could sustain high winds. I brought this to fly over the sea where gusts were up to 70 km/hr and it held out well. Although I did receive some high wind warnings on my controller, the video quality was still very stable and the Air 3 was able to fly with ease. But be careful flying in high wind situations, as it will not be able to return to home automatically."

I've been flying the DJI Mavic Air 3 for a while now, and there’s a lot to love about this drone. It has some standout features like the zoom lens, an impressive flight time of over 40 minutes per battery, and exceptional durability in windy conditions, thanks to its weight being over 250g. I was also really impressed that it came with so many extra propellers.However, if I had to choose again between the Air 3 and the DJI Mini Pro 4, I might lean towards the Mini Pro 4. While the Air 3’s zoom feature is handy, it's not truly 4K quality, which limits its usefulness in certain shots. The Mini Pro 4 offers the same main camera as the Air 3 but has the added advantage of being under 250g, making it more versatile and usable in more locations, and easier to let others fly because no drone pilot license would be required.That being said, I do love the Mavic Air 3. There were some opportunities for improvement such as the drone doesn't come with a case or protective covering for the propellers, and the blades easily get caught when putting the drone in the bag. I was also surprised it only came with one charging cord - three would have been ideal to optimize all the charging ports if possible because the batteries do take a long time to charge.Overall, I would rate the Mavic Air 3 a 4.5/5. It’s an excellent drone, but with a better quality zoom lens, it could easily be a full 5 stars."
"As a hobbyist only, I didn’t want to get into having to register with FAA or deal with the new FAA Remote ID requirements for drones that is upcoming in 2023.  But will say a drone under .55 lbs is tiny…  my old toy drone was twice the size of the Atom SE.Anyway, in my usage I found the addition of GPS really took this to the next level for me – makes it very stable drone.  There are a few setup videos you can watch from within the app (PotensicPro), suggest you do this.  Also take some time going through the app, looking at and setting things up before trying to fly.  That and the setup guide was all I needed, other than to allow time for a few updates to install and do compass calibration.This drone hovers very stable, even in wind and it’s very fast and responsive.  And with GPS, the Return to Home feature worked really well – within five feet.  Do suggest you set the height of RTH to the highest structure or tree in your flying area, as there is no obstacle avoidance (other than straight down).  Keep in mind RTH is from takeoff point, not where you are at that point (if you move around). The Follow Me feature, only follows the controller, and this wasn’t very smooth. But way points worked great.Images were GREAT with this 12 MP Sony Sensor, and even better after viewing the SD Card.  Now flying in wind is where you’ll find that not having a 3-Axis Gimble is an issue for video, that and not being smooth on the throttle (but I’ll get there).  If you are buying this for fun of flying, it’s will meet your needs.  Will say the EIS does do a pretty good job, I saw videos of reviews of other drones in this price range… many had a lot of “jello” in them.  I haven’t seen that at all on the ATOM SE.  The Camera has a motorized gimbal to tilt up and down during flight, another improvement from my “toy” drone.  But I hope Potensic can make this work a little slower in future software updates.It uses your phone (I have an iPhone) to connect to the controller with a provided cable to view FPV video as you fly, and for some settings.  Had no issues with the flight video dropping out, but where I was flying, I couldn’t test the limits of the range…  I only went about 2,000’ was as far as I could go and keep line of sight.Drone is very fast in Sports mode, just learning so I kept in in Video mode most the time.  Modes can be changed in the app while in flight.  Was very easy to control even with some winds that would have blown my old “toy” drone away.Price… not sure what to say here I got it for about $235 with New Year’s sale and an affiliate coupon code from one of those review channels.  I felt at that price point, it was a great value.Pros:- Under 250 Grams so no registration required.- Video and Pictures are great for a Hobby device.- Potensic is doing firmware updates on this new drone (hope they support it a long time)- Quality seemed good for the price paid.- Came as a complete package (fly more style).- Good flight time, 26 Mins- True Radio Drone, not WiFi.  So very long control and FPV range- Really fun to fly, clear upgrade over non-GPS drones.Cons:- Lack of 3-Axis Gimble (think it was FB they mentioned a gimble version is in the works)- Follow Me, didn’t work to well- No obstacle avoidance- $299 suggested price… at that point a DJI Mini SE might push me to spend a little more.- New drone, so no parts at this point"
"I recently bought the Potensic Atom SE, and I am truly impressed by how well this drone performs. Right out of the box, it was easy to set up and get flying, which is great if you’re newer to drones or just want something user-friendly. The camera quality is surprisingly clear, capturing sharp, stable footage that looks professional. The GPS and return-to-home features are reliable and give me peace of mind while flying. Battery life is decent, and it charges fairly quickly, allowing for more frequent flights.Overall, I’d recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable, high-quality drone. It's perfect for casual users and hobbyists who want a taste of professional features without the high price."

I have had the Potensic Atom SE drone now for over a month and have flown it every weekend, so now I feel I can post an honest review. This is reall a great drone. May not have all the bells and whistles of that other company, but it doesn't have the price tag either. This is my first drone with GPS and what a difference that makes. I also love the fact that if I'm ever in a panic situation I can just release the controller joysticks  and the drone will immediately stop whatever it's doing and hover in place. That's saved me a few times already. It is very easy to fly, even for a novice flyer. The controller and app are easy to handle and understand. Very comfortable controller and I like how it holds your phone, very easy to read, and has a range of 4km (about 2 1/2 miles) but I'll never really know how far it can go since I have to keep the drone itself in sight the whole time while flying. The furthest I've flown it was about 3200ft (about .6 miles) and the only reason I could see it that far off is because it was at twilight on a cloudy day and I could see my anticollision strobe blinking. The drone is very easy to handle, very responsive, and FAST! In Sport mode I reached 35mph, per the app. The video quality is impressive during the day, not so much at night. Photos are OK for use online and smaller photographs, but as a photographer I would like to see a better camera where I can make small enlargements, but, again, you can't complain too much at this price point. It handles windy days pretty well and have had no problems with it there. The Follow Me, Waypoint, and Circle Flight works as should and the RTH feature is great. I've initiated it myself a few times and had it return on it's own because of low battery, all times landing within feet of the takeoff point. I get about 25 minutes of flight per battery charge which is decent. The manual is easy to understand (although you have to download it, no physical manual with purchase) and the Customer Service has been GREAT. Had some concerns about the way my drone was packaged and they got back to me almost immediately and help solve my problem. Overall, I highly recommend this drone and you get alot for the price. I LOVE FLYING THIS THING! The ONLY regret I have in purchasing this is that I purchased it off of Amazon - nothing against Amazon, I love them too - but I wish I had gone directly to the Potensic website and seen the new and improved Atom drone and I would have definitley purchased that instead. At the time it was not available on Amazon (is now though) and is not that all more expensive than the SE.Update 11/22/2023 I mentioned in my review a few weeks back that I had a good experience with the Potensic Customer Service department and I had another great experience dealing with them again. Unfortunately, I had an accident with a tree and broke off my front right landing gear (the arm was fine) and couldn't find all the pieces. I emailed the customer service site and told them what happened and sent pictures and they got back to me within a day. They said it was repairable and gave me a price, plus gave me the option of purchasing a replacement Atom SE for a discounted price (BIG discount). After thinking about it I just went about fixing it myself with an old credit card, toothpick, and epoxy - think Frankenstein, but it flies no problem. I was tempted to take them up on their offer for the new SE, but would rather fix this one and save for an upgraded drone. When they asked what I'd like to do and told them I fixed it myself they were almost apologetic that I crashed my drone and offered to send me a new set of paddles. If that's not great customer service, I'm not sure what is. An overall great experience."

I'm new to using these vehicles (under 5 hours flight time so far) and spent a lot of time deciding on which would be my first. I am extremely pleased I chose this one! The video included in this review has been greatly reduced for posting here but, trust me the 4k30fps original is truly quite spectacular for such a reasonably priced drone. I have found a little forward flight and gentle control movements while maneuvering greatly increases image stability, even in the 6-8 meter per second gusts present during capture.The flight characteristics of this vehicle are intuitive, very tame and highly competent. Mine has exceeded all claims made in the product description and then some. Battery life is terrific and the transmission range is quite frankly amazing. Even with power lines in between and a security system broadcasting nearby on 2.4gHz I can fly out 1000 meters and more. The controls are very, very smooth.This quad-copter is helping me gain skill and confidence. All I could have asked for and more.Thank you Potensic!*Update one year later...This has proven to be an excellent purchase. I have zero complaints and have had absolutely no reason to contact Potensic, for anything other than to give my profound thanks for offering so much quality for so little cost. In fact I have nothing but praise for Potensic and this magnificent little flying machine - with a camera attached!Again many, many thanks."
"Fun  to fly, easy to install, nice bad, good camera. For more serous use, buy the gimbal."

Easy to use and very well made. well packaged and protected. Thank you. Love this lamp for my computer desk.

"I've been using the Arzroic Tablet Holder Mount with my 6th Gen iPad on my DJI Mini 3 RC-N1 controller for about three months now, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. The build quality is decent for the price, and I've encountered no issues with durability or wear and tear over time. Installation was a breeze, thanks to its clamshell design which simply requires loosening two screws to fit around the controller antenna and then tightening until snug. Once mounted, my iPad felt securely in place, which was a pleasant surprise.The holder significantly enhances my drone flying experience by allowing me to use my iPad's larger screen for a better view of the video output. This improvement makes it much easier to see what I'm filming, which is a big plus. However, it's worth noting that the mount does not come with a cable long enough to connect a larger tablet like the 6th Gen iPad to the controller. I had to purchase a separate cable for this purpose, which was an additional expense.Despite this minor inconvenience, I would still recommend this tablet holder to any drone enthusiast looking for a reliable way to enhance their flying experience with a larger display. Just be prepared to invest in an extra cable if you're using a larger tablet. Overall, I'd rate this product 4 stars for its solid performance and value, with a point deducted for the additional cable requirement."

I was worried about this product being too flimsy and not able to hold a heavy tablet but after using it, I have no complaints it holds The tablet quite easy it doesn’t slip out or fall out Keep the tablet in nice and tight all in all Easy to set up."
"Used with a 10 inch tablet. Mounts easily, keeps the tablet secure, and is compact enough when folded down that it slides into the DJI carry bag no problem. Running a bigger screen is definitely the way to go, though it's advisable to get/make a screen shade too."
"Bought to hold an iPad on my Air 2S and Mini 2 controller.  Couple simple screws to mount the base and ready to go.  At first it was awkward mounting ipad, but it was my fault. After trying different ways of holding the controller extension piece I found the best way for me in seconds. Holding the controller in my left hand and holding iPad horizontally in my right hand I place the iPad under the flip up tab on the mount and push the iPad up, extending the controllers antenna extension, then slip bottom of iPad over the ‘jump’, actually the two rubber stops.  The 3rd and 4th photos illustrate what I tried to type.  Couldn’t find the correct nomenclature.  I hope you get the drift.  Anyway, it is very sturdy and even tho it feels like ipad will snap the piece, it never does.  Been using two of them for months on both drones.  Very good"
"I got the thing on OK. But when I put either of my two tablets, I did not feel secure that it would not drop my tablet if turned the thing slightly. I did like that it stayed with the drone. That it was easy to hold a tablet. I just didn't trust it. Returning. YMMV"
I took a leap and it paid off. Works great with an iPad.
"Bought this because I was using a 3rd party cable since I accidentally ran over my origional cable.  The 3rd party cable did not work ever, but this OEM cable has worked every time."
As advertisedWork wellGood price
Works exactly as it should.  Fast shipping
Very Good Quality
its an oem cable at an affordable price. Works as the old one did.
Same length as the original on my mavic 2.
It’s works seems to be ok
So far everything comes in the box. Inside the camera box are the lanyard & batteries for the camera. And the rest is what the holiday bundle states will have inside. Haven't used the camera but can't wait to use it for some Christmas pictures of my baby. So far this is worth it especially if it comes with extra accessories for the camera.
"My 10-year-old daughter got this for her birthday and she loves it. Granted the film is pretty expensive to buy, but it’s a cool gift that takes me back to the time when we used to use Polaroids."
"We got this for a birthday party gift, and to use at the party. So cute and easy enough for a child to use. So nostalgic and adorable!"
Holiday packages is good for gift
I got this for a gift and LOVED that it comes with everything said on the box!! 🥰
Loved the camera however pictures come out darker
The camera work and it was as described

"We had two of these easy to use cameras. The photos come out very well. We also had an album that is set up to quickly slide the photo into a slot and place for a message next to the photo. It was really fun to go thru the photos and album late night, after the wedding events were finished."
"It’s super easy to operate, and the mint green color is adorable. The photos develop quickly, capturing great memories. Perfect for parties or just everyday fun!"
Bought for my grandaughter and she’s loves it and the case along with it perfect to carry so doesn’t get dropped since on her shoulder tytyty:)
"Loved it,  hate that it was stolen."
It won’t ever be something you use all the time. But the design is good and the picture quality is good enough for price point and ease of use. Instant will never be digital and vice versa. Good for parties or making little memories. Cartridges aren’t cheap and only 10 exposures per. But solid for right use.
Great item that came on time and it works great.
This camera is the best gift you can give to anyone. The color options are great and it’s definitely worth the money. It is very durable and the shipping was fast.Love how easy it is for anyone to use it. It’s great for capturing in the moment moments. !
"This camera takes excellent, retro-looking pictures. I love being able to capture moments and have a hard copy to look at. We look at most pics today on an electronic device so it is nice to have a pic to put on display.  The pictures are small but cute. This makes a great gift."
"In a digital age, the charm of instant photography remains unparalleled, and the Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 is a testament to this. Having used it for several events and casual outings, I am excited to delve into what makes this camera a delightful pick for instant photography enthusiasts.**Design and Aesthetics: 4.5/5**The Instax Mini 12 sports a fresh, playful design that's both eye-catching and ergonomic. Available in a variety of colors, it caters to different tastes. Its lightweight and compact nature make it a convenient carry-along, though the plastic build might not appeal to all.**Image Quality and Performance: 4/5**For an instant camera, the Mini 12 offers commendable image quality. The colors are vibrant, and the exposure adjustment works well in various lighting conditions. It might struggle a bit in low light, but that's a common limitation in instant photography. The added selfie mirror is a fun touch for selfie enthusiasts.**Ease of Use: 5/5**This is where the Mini 12 truly shines. Its point-and-shoot simplicity makes it accessible to all ages. The automatic exposure control and flash adjustment are great for beginners, removing the guesswork and making every shot count.**Film Cost and Availability: 3.5/5**The ongoing cost of film packs is a consideration for any instant camera. While the Instax Mini film is widely available, the cost per print might add up for frequent users. However, the unique charm of each printed photo often outweighs this concern.**Battery Life: 4/5**The battery life is impressive, lasting through multiple film packs on a single charge, though this can vary based on usage patterns. The convenience of a rechargeable battery over traditional AA batteries is a definite plus.**Overall: 4.2/5**The Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 is a delightful instant camera that combines style, simplicity, and the joy of instant photography. It's perfect for capturing spontaneous moments, parties, and creating physical keepsakes on the go. Despite the ongoing cost of film, its ease of use and the fun factor make it a great choice for anyone looking to step into the world of instant photography."
"I bought this camera right before my daughters first birthday because I wanted to capture her little moments in a sweet way. I have loved it! The pictures come out great, the camera itself is very pretty, and the case is a wonderful addition. Use is super straight forward. For me personally it was a bit of a splurge but people spend more than this on cameras all the time so it might depend on your situation whether or not it is worth the price"
"Got this camera for a birthday party and it was so much fun! Everyone was obsessed with taking pics, shaking them out, and waiting to see how they’d turn out. It seriously made the night feel way cooler.The case is great for throwing it in your bag without worrying about it getting messed up, and having the extra rolls was a lifesaver. If you want something fun and nostalgic for your next hangout, this camera’s a must!"
"The quality of the body is excellent, it is not hard enough to drop to the floor and wait it will be okay, but enough to keep in bags or something like this. It’s so much simple to use (the start bottom is the lens hahaha). I bought the mint color and it looks pretty nice, is not annoying green. Trust me, you will need more than 40 films, but for the price let’s say it’s just ok. In low light condition it could take the photo out of focus. And the flash is too much for selfies at night."
Super practical and easy to use.The film don't look so good in daylight (the polaroid is very clear). But I loved it anyway.

I love it ! The color choice the photo album super cute and the extra camera films. It takes cute pic but you definitely have to have good lighting. Value for money is good."
"The camera works absolutely perfectly. Very simple to use, and the picture quality is very good."
The camera is fun to take pictures on girl's night or date night! The pictures are a great size to include in a greeting card or to put in a scrapbook. It packs easily as well to take it on trips.
"We got this camera for our daughter's 9th birthday and it is perfection! Easy to set up and get started, even comes with batteries! If you are expecting iPhone quality pictures, don't! But that's the fun of this camera...Real pictures being developed right in front of your eyes! Which is totally magical for kids that have ever only known digital technology...And totally nostalgic for us parents that grew up with this! The pics are retro and still good quality. The camera case, stickers, album, and cleaning cloth are all excellent quality. This product came with 60 sheets of film. Great value! The pics print out immediately after snapping the shot and my daughter now truly knows what it means to ""shake it like a polaroid""  lolFantastic product and definitely recommend for kids AND adults!"
She loved the camera. Took photos all morning. Best part is the photo is tangible!
I like how easy it is to change the film! The tiny photo album is perfect
"Probably a favorite gift for our 15 year old. She carried it around all Christmas weekend getting photos with cousins and friends and putting them in the included album. Lots of fun. Comes with everything you need and lots of film to get started. The photo album, case and stickers are a great bonus!"
"The batteries that this come with doesn't work. Other than that, this is a good product."
Great starter pack for a gift
Kept it along With the guest book for pic perfect msg for birthday boy.
Love this.  Son has one as well.  Lots of fun for taking pics.
"I recently purchased this Polaroid camera for my bridal, and it was an absolute hit! The camera itself is incredibly cute with a charming retro design that instantly catches the eye. It’s not just a pretty face, though - this little camera performs wonderfully.The instant print feature is fantastic. It takes high-quality pictures and prints them out quickly, making it perfect for capturing spontaneous moments. Our guests had a blast snapping photos and scrapbooking in the guest book! It added a fun, interactive element to the party that everyone enjoyed.Setting it up was a breeze, and the controls are straightforward enough for anyone to use. Even the kids could get in on the action without any hassle. The prints themselves are vibrant and clear, and the small size makes them perfect keepsakes.Overall, I couldn’t be happier with this purchase. It’s not just a camera; it’s a great activity that brings people together and creates lasting memories. Highly recommend for any event or gathering! Definitely worth the price!"
"a very cool retro style camera, it is very convenient to get the finished photo immediately after taking the photo, after waiting a few seconds) I like to take it with me and catch wonderful moments"
Good bundle and fun product.  Pictures are classic look and won't be sharp (but hopefully that's not why you bought this).  My partner and I use this to log a lot of our hikes and every day cameos.
"I love this instax so much! I hesitated for a long time but I pulled the trigger on getting it because I went to an event states away and I wanted to have physical pictures. It did a great job, as good of quality of Polaroids can be of course. The crossbody strap held up and keeps the camera secure. This was an awesome bundle for the price!"
"This was a great gift for my niece, The only downside is the Camarra would print a lot a blank pictures."
Works great! Compact and great carry case
I gave this as a gift for someones birthday. She loved it and it takes great pictures. Would recommend this for someone who likes to take pictures and get them fast.
"It's amazing, fast printing, great quality, stickers too."
I loveeeee this camera! I‚Äôve wanted a retro instant camera for a few years and finally decided to buy this one right before a recent vacation. I didn‚Äôt want to be tied to my phone or be tempted to post every moment of my trip on social media so this was a great purchase. The pictures came out amazing and I had a great trip as I was able to be more present than if I was worried about taking pics on my phone constantly.
"This camera is 10/10. I love it because the Polarid is bigger than an average one. Easy to use, have had it for months and haven‚Äôt had any issues."
