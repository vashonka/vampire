"This pillow was JUST what we needed for our long drive from FL to MA. We took turns napping with it and holy crap, it helped our necks a lot. Driving is already stressful enough, we wanted a little bit of relief when we could manage it. It is soft but durable, the shape fits your head and neck how you want it to, the clip is adjustable and could probably fit most neck sizes, and was easy to find a good cozy spot no matter how I positioned myself in the car. High value for low cost. My only laugh is the case/cover it came inâ€¦ donâ€™t plan to get it back in there, it expanded when I took it out and it just wonâ€™t go back in lol. Iâ€™m fine with that, itâ€™s more useful being ready to go. Enjoy!"
"re: CSJT Travel Pillow Vacuum Compressed Memory Foam Neck Pillow Review:As an avid traveler, I'm always on the lookout for products that can elevate my travel experience, and the CSJT Travel Pillow has certainly exceeded my expectations. This pillow offers a real sleeping experience, making long flights or road trips incredibly comfortable and rejuvenating.One of the standout features of this pillow is its memory foam construction, which provides exceptional support to both the neck and shoulders. This has been a game-changer for me, as I no longer wake up with stiffness or soreness after hours of travel. The pillow molds perfectly to my body, ensuring that I can relax and rest peacefully throughout the journey.What sets the CSJT Travel Pillow apart is its vacuum-compressed design. This not only makes it incredibly lightweight and easy to carry but also allows for convenient storage when not in use. I appreciate how compact it becomes after compression, fitting snugly into my carry-on without taking up too much space.Furthermore, the pillow's super-soft fabric adds to the overall comfort, making it a pleasure to rest against during long flights. The fact that it's machine-washable is a bonus, ensuring that it stays clean and hygienic even after multiple uses.In summary, the CSJT Travel Pillow has become an essential part of my travel kit. Its superior comfort, support, and portability make it a must-have for anyone looking to make their journeys more enjoyable and restful. I highly recommend this pillow to fellow travelers seeking a real sleeping experience on the go."
We love this pillow. I purchased two of them to use on a long train trip we are taking. We've tried it out several times each and love them! Very well made. The pillow can be turned to support your neck in any position. The material used to create the pillow is both sturdy and very comfortable. The carry case is excellent for keeping it clean and ready to go. The strap with secure clasp will enable us to clip it to each of our backpacks. Very nice and highly recommended for anyone who likes to travel or who tends to fall asleep while watching TV ;-).
"I purchased this neck/travel pillow for my upcoming trip to Spain. However since then I tore my ACL, had surgery and have had to work from home. I have been using Immersed on the Quest 3 to have multiple screens but it is bulky and hurts my neck if I use it too long.  Then I realized, travel pillow! This thing has been a gamechanger.It is very supportive of my neck, especially when sitting for long periods. It is comfortable, firm, and very transportable. I believe it a good price for the quality and would highly recommend.To be transparent, it is sometimes tricky to get back in the carrying case, it may take 2-3 tries of rolling it, but I've always managed to get it back in.In summary if you need neck support this is a fantastic option."
"I bought this travel pillow because I'm traveling a lot this summer and fall, both in a car and plane. It comes with its own case so I can sling it over my suitcase or my shoulder. It is very easy to put on and quite comfortable. I can easily fall asleep in the car or plane while wearing the pillow. Most importantly, I don't have any neck pain after a long car or plane ride. I'm also using it at night while I sleep, and it helps me maintain a neutral position while I sleep. I highly recommend this pillow."
"Iâ€™m a petite female with a small neck. This pillow did not work for me. For reference, Iâ€™ve included photos of my neck area plus a couple photos with the neck pillow. If your chin and neck area is shaped similar to mine, I recommend trying a different pillow.On the plus side, the fabric is very smooth and silky, and I do like how the back portion of the cushion is nice and flat. Itâ€™s a pillow was the right size for you, I think it would definitely feel nice.However, when I tightened the strap all the way, I still had a pretty significant gap between the cushion and the front of my neck. So then when I allowed my head to drop forward, my chin dropped into the gap, and I ended up sort of dangling on my cheekbones (see photo.) NOT comfortable. Likewise, the pillow slid around when I dropped my head to the side, preventing me from getting true support.(My husband - who has a larger frame than mine - also had trouble with his chin falling through. So this problem may not be unique to petite females.)"
"I bought this neck pillow for a long flight and it kept me comfortable the whole time. The firm design helps hold the neck straight and still provides functionality. It's very light weight, and great value for the money. I'd recommend trying it out!"
"This neck pillow is exactly what you need for international travel. It’s so comfortable and lightweight. I fell asleep for hours on a flight to Spain and woke up with no neck pain. Slept like a baby. Side note- when I first opened it I almost returned it. It was vacuum sealed and didn’t look anything like the picture. It was completely flat. I left it out for about a half an hour, and it returned to its original form and was soft  and plush. Buy it!!"
"I really like how this neck pillow is made, it's a very soft fabric without hard edges like the blow up ones and it has multiple snaps so you can really fit it to your neck comfortably! I sprained my neck, so this has been a life saver for sleep and to help hold my rice bag. It comes vacuum sealed, but all you have to do is lay it out and squish it around to get air back into it."
"The fabric and pillow are both soft. It's easy to attach onto anything. It didn't sit as comfortably around my neck and big hair as I had hoped, but you can still use it as a pillow without putting it on your neck. Cover is easy to remove, wash, and reattach."
I bought this for eye surgery recovery since I couldn't find my older one.  This one!  This is way different and works perfectly.  It has made the difference in my ability to sleep through the night!  I will be using this  every night from now on.  What a difference!  Highly recommend.  Very comfortable and keeps your neck supported w/o discomfort.
I originally bought these when I got ear piercings to help me sleep but I absolutely love how comfortable they are. Super soft and I like the ability to clip the ends together. Perfect travel pillow.

"Good comfortable materials, durable, and can’t go wrong with this for the trips…."
"This neck pillow arrived on the day that my husband had shoulder replacement surgery and he has bragged and bragged on this new pillow. Last night was the first night that he slept in our bed, and in the meantime, this pillow provided hours of comfort in his time of healing, resting in his recliner. It was exactly what Dr. Wife ordered. This pillow has helped with the ""full recovery"" that I've prayed for."
Very comfortable.  No edges that are harsh because its not a blow up one.  Soft.  I found turning it upside down works the best 😊  I never fall alseep on planes.  Slept for almost 3 hours
"I was going to take this neck pillow with me to Japan as we had two evening flights.  I tried it out at home and it was too bulky, too firm and too uncomfortable.  Not easy to put in your bag on the plane, unless you're carrying a large bag.  I left it at home and haven't used it."
Very comfortable

My daughter had a herniated disk in her neck. She was so uncomfortable between doctor appointments. We bought this hoping it would support her neck without that awkward collar. It's nice and firm...not soft like some you pick up at box stores. It is a memory foam to mold and support as you need it. It helped her when she was in a recliner or even lying back to keep from turning her head too quickly. Her doctor was fine with it.
"Pros- beautiful color, nice material, carry bag is handy, loop for attaching to bag, decently comfortable, and very affordableCons- takes awhile to expand when it first arrives, has a very potent smell for a few days, and is made for someone with a thicker neck (I have a more slender neck and it doesn't support very well because it slips around)"
"This head rest is a great addition to use for your chair or couch.  This is also great for passengers in a vehicle!  Pretty blue color and soft to touch, but sturdy.  It can even be hung up when not in use.  It is very nice to have this, and I use it when watching TV.  Worth the price for sure!"
"So comfy. Has a strap for travel and also comes with a little travel bag that keeps it clean. The strap easily attaches to a backpack or luggage handle. I use it most at night when my GERD is kicking up and I have to sleep in my recliner. Keeps my neck from getting sore with a crik. Memory foam is so nice, soft and comfy. And the snap in the front keeps it from falling off. Didn't know I needed it, now I can't live without it!"
Very hard filling. No give at all. Keeps neck immobilized but felt like a was in a straight jacket. Wish it was softer.
"I ordered this because I was going on a ten hour drive - 10 going and 10 returning.It saved my neck from being stiff and sore.  The only problem I had with it is that the material is so soft, my grandkids kept trying it out.  I finally had to hide it so that I would have it for the return trip.  I am thinking that I may have to get a couple as a gift to them."
Very comfy and easy to take the cover out and clean.
The pillow is both
high quality product. Highly recommended.
The product is very nice. It was sent as a gift and the person who received it loved it!
"Have tried all types of travel pillows for use in reclined sofas, airplane seats. This one is simple and comfortable. Nice if it came with a clear plastic travel bag I've seen strapped to luggage or back packs."
This pillow is amazing!
"When I used to lie on the beach to sunbathe, I would use a beach towel or an inflatable pillow. They were portable, but they never felt quite comfortable. After seeing this travel pillow, I purchased this one, and it is now one of my must-have items for our beach trips. It looks cute, compact and doesn’t take up much space, light, and easy to pack into its waterproof storage bag. Its size is perfect for one person to lie on. The surface is soft cotton, and the inside is filled with sponge blocks and offers medium support, it feels lasting. When I lie down, the height is just right for my neck, and it feels comfortable with good rebound and support without feeling stuffy. Sometimes, when my back needs a little support while napping, I also use it. After use it's easy to shake off sand and pet hair. The pillowcase is removable and washable. It has made sunbathing on the beach much more comfortable. I'm satisfied with its performance, so I give it five stars."
Doesn't come with a bag to repack after use but small/mighty. Good memory foam pillow option for camping
"I bought this to use on my camping trips to avoid bringing my own pillows from home. I typically car camp in a tent or a primitive cabin, so I'm not worried much about having something that is super light and packable, but this pillow is fairly light and could definitely be packed into a smaller bag than what it comes in if it were totally necessary. It seems to have foam chunks inside that give it a little more flexibility but it is actually very comfortable. I am a back and side sleeper and I found it to be the most comfortable when I was on my back since it is not very thick. The cover is soft and removable for easy washing. It is a great travel pillow for car camping or for roadtrips. Im considering another to keep in my car with my emergency kit. Living in the northeast, you never know when a blizzard might leave you stranded!"
"I just received this travel pillow, and it’s really soft and comfortable. The quality is also great, very suitable for long-distance car use, in short, is very satisfied with a shopping!"
I really like this pillow super comfy I would definitely purchase again! I actually bought it for the car it’s perfect size not too small or too big!
Easy to pack and fluffs up quickly. It's comfortable and firm enough for a travel pillow.
"Small pillow for camping, and reasonably soft. I prefer a little firmer, as the shape doesn't hold at all. It packed down small, but I'd rather just use a sweatshirt next time"
"I love this little pillow. I bought this for a trip to use mainly on the plane and during transport. I have always had a hard time with the typical neck pillows because the sides are just too high for my neck and I can never get comfortable. This little pillow was perfect. It’s full of chopped up memory foam pieces, making it easy to squish and fit how and where I wanted it. It’s pretty soft and squishy, but I found it gave me the support I needed. The pillow cover is breathable and soft, and the travel case is a nice touch! Definitely recommend!"
"I received my order today. These pillows are for a gift. The pillows arrived in a flat vacuum sealed plastic bag. After removing from the bad they are very flat, but… I put them in the dryer with a wet washcloth & now they are perfect & fluffy. I do this to all my pillows once a month. I would buy these pillows again."
Quality y size exact. Nicest small pillowsI've purchased. Would buy again. Pillow cases also match y nice silky quality.
These came so FLATE! No instructions but after reading some reviews I chanced washing them before sending them back. They came out perfectly-nice plump little pillows like I expected when ordered them. NO where do they tell you this.
They’re perfect for a baby or toddler. They’re not too fluffy.
Absolutely amazing the way this small flat pillow fluffed up.  I put in the dryer Low with a damp clean washcloth for 15 minutes and pillows were transformed into wonderful soft clouds.  I have bought toddler pillows for twice the price of these pillows for only one. These come in a pack of 2.  I will definitely buy these again.  They are so soft and comfy.  So very pleased with my purchase.
I used to get the best travel size/toddler pillows at my local Walmart. They no longer carry them. I took a chance and ordered this set of 2 travel size/toddler pillows. The size was perfect. The price was comparable to others I saw online (if not a little bit cheaper). I received them and was very disappointed. They were kinda flat and underfilled. One of them was even flatter and less filled then the other one. I was disappointed by the thinness when I was expecting a better quality. The pillows were not comfortable. The material of the pillow cases was nice quality. I just wish they had more filling.
Those pillows arrive very flat. It didn't come with instructions but after reading all the bad reviews I learned it needed to be put in the dryer. They did fluff up but did not fill the case by any means. I am not able to return these because I need them for a gift. Sadly I will have to rip out the seams and add more stuffing...I should have just made my own pillows but thought I could save time. I will not purchase from this company again.
This is a very comfortable and well-made pillow. I bought some for my dog's bed. He loves it and sleeps on it. Good quality. Affordable price!
"As a flight attendant, I frequently have soso hotel pillows… they are either too soft or too firm or bother my allergies. This pillow is the perfect size for regular use. It compresses to a nice size to not take up too much space. The quilted design of the pillow cover is very cozy. My only issue is the compression bag it is in is a poor quality… after two uses, the drawstring ripped through the fabric… I can still compress the pillow, but the bag is unsightly and probably will not last much longer.No issues with smell from the foam. It maintains its shape and fluffiness over time.I’m definitely happy with the quality, support and value"
Very comfortable pillows. Keeps my head cool throughout the whole night. Very good value. Has a good firmness. It’s adjustable to your liking and seems durabile
"The 4-star rating isn't because there was anything wrong with the pillow. It's because the manufacturer doesn't label their product appropriately. I went to a lot of time and trouble to verify that I had the correct pillow. Simply identify the product as you did on the order web page.I received a set of 2 pillows as expected, however there was no indication ON the box or IN the box that this was a cooling pillow. The box looked nothing like the picture. The box in the picture clearly says it is a cooling pillow. Now I have to go to the Amazon website and try to determine IF I have the correct pillow. The picture also shows a bag of Extra Memory Foam. I did not see this in the box.The cooling pillow is made of viscose bamboo, sort of. It says ""Viscose made from Bamboo infused Outer cover"". The other pillow is labeled a side, back sleeper, and stomach sleeper which the cooling pillow is also. The other pillow says the material is memory foam but also says ""Modal Fiber & Viscose made from bamboo Cover"". Am I confused yet? YES!The 2 pillow set is vacuumed packed. I don't want to open a pillow in case it's the wrong one. Nothing on the outside of the vacuum-packed pillow gives me a solid clue. The customer website indicated on the included marketing materials does not work. A Google search of the pillow directs me to Amazon. The pillow is sold by Qatello LLC. No contact information there. I contact Amazon support. They were not able to find out either, so they issued an exchange.Last ditch effort out of curiosity, I opened one of the pillows. I opened the zipper to view the tag where I expected to find  what the materials were made of. Low and behold, there was an additional bag of memory foam inside of a net bag that was sealed. If you want to add just the right amount of form, you have to cut open the extra memory foam bag. Now you have to properly store the rest. Nothing like the picture. Also, the materials indicated that they were made from viscose made from bamboo, which is meaningless since both pillows contain viscose made from bamboo. So maybe they're both cooling pillows.I canceled the exchange order. This could all have been avoided if the box and packaging materials inside indicated that this is a COOLING PILLOW. Also should indicate that the extra memory foam bag is located inside the pillow and can be removed.I fluffed up the pillow in a low dryer setting for a few minutes. Boom! Big and fluffy. I left the extra foam bag inside the first night. I am a side sleeper, so it was a bit too firm. I removed the bag the next night. The pillow is VERY COMFORTABLE. I no longer flip my pillow all night long because it gets too warm.It DOES KEEP COOL. I only flip it when changing sides because the foam has settled."
"This pillow lives up to the manufacturer’s description. It puffed up in the drier and did not have a lingering smell. It was comfortable to use. It crushed back down into the sack thus making it a light weight, packable item."
"I use this for car camping and it is fantastic. Super compact and comfortable, definitely a good choice."
"I first purchased this pillow about a year ago and it was the best pillow I had ever used. I have some neck issues and this pillow was perfect in every way for me. Great support once I adjusted the fill yet still so soft. However, I purchased the exact same pillow twice again more recently and returned both of them - the fill was lumpy and flat. Very uncomfortable. The memory foam appeared very different from the foam in the first one I had purchased. I wasnt brave enough to try again so I purchased a different pillow not from Amazon. I was so incredibly happy with the first one but so let down by subsequent pillows. I’m not sure why the drastic change but was unhappy with the lack of consistency."
"I bought this Nappler Small Shredded Memory Foam Pillow for a camping trip I took with my girl scout troop. I am more of a glamper than a camper, everything I have learned about camping is through my girl scout trainings and the wonderful world of YouTube. My troop wanted to go camping at the aquarium, so of course as the wonderful troop leader I am, I set it up. The aquarium allowed us to bring a pillow and a twin air mattress. I immediately knew, I would be carrying many of my 3-4th grader's belongings because girls forget things.I picked this pillow because it is easy to fold up and light weight. I was easily able to clip this pillow on my backpack and go. The pillow was very comfortable and easily folded back up for the next use. I would absolutely recommend buying this if you are looking for light weight and comfortable!"
"Pros:You can take out the filling and find your perfect heightThe pillows come with extra filling (I made an entire other pillow with the extra filling)The pillow does have a nice cooling effectQuality bamboo washable coversWell made zippers to remove fillingThe shredded foam is a medium to firm density and fells nice on your headCons:Smell, Smell, Smell!!! I’ve had products that smelled but these pillows really smell! Had them outside in the sun for 2 days, sprayed them with Lysol fabric, and washed the covers, but they still smell. The smell is slowly starting to get better. If you can’t tolorate a chemical smell (like my sister), these are not for you.There are a few pieces of hard foam are in the pillow that you can feel from time to time.Would I recommend the pillows? Yes, if you can air them out for a few days to let the chemical smell dissipate. Overall a good value for the price."
Wanted a nice comfortable pillow for when I travelled or camped. This is perfect!!! Nice and soft and comfy which packs lovely and small to chuck in your luggage
It's comfortable & compact! All of things needed in a camp pillow! Will get my own pillow protector custom made though & that would have been a great addition !
Brilliant quality just what I wanted.
"I was really nervous after reading some reviews, but gave it a try. I loved it and slept without any neck pain. I will say that it takes a little while to get used to the feeling of the bulkiness of this pillow, as well as how snug it fits around the neck. But it was so worth it when I was able to sleep for long periods of time of time on an international trip and would wake up without any of the typical neck discomfort. I found putting the high side closer to my chin beneficial, as well."
I used this on my latest long-haul flight. It made sleeping in economy so easy and I was able to arrive well-rested. My neck was well supported throughout the flight.
"The first time I put on this pillow, I thought it was more comfortable than any other travel pillow I have used. It was soft and comforting to the point where I just want to sit there and take a nap. Some reviewers don't like the different or asymmetrical sides, but I like it and love to snuggle into the taller side tucking in my ear. It does ok with my super small earbuds but my Airpod pros get uncomfortable as it puts pressure on the top part of my ears. I like the support around my neck and love the super soft feel on my face. However, not all pillow are made equally. I gave my first pillow to my wife to try and she immediately stole it, so I had to buy another one. I purchased 4 more before I was able to find one with the same feel. I bought them in multiple colors and was surprised to find that each one had its own feel. One was more firm while another was not snug enough. I suggest that if you give these pillows a try, and I suggest you do, don't let anyone else try it or they may steal it away.When it comes to cost, it is more expensive than even the highest rated pillows out there. I have tried many of them and prefer to pay a little more for being able to sleep comfortably on a long trip.As far as carrying and storing this pillow, I will admit that I have to roll it up for other members of my family as it takes a little hand strength to shrink it down to fit in the carrying bag. I use a backpack and it fits nicely in the larger compartment with no problem. It is about the same as my previous neck pillow."
I bought 3 of these for our trip to Australia and we all agreed that they were a game changer. We go to Australia every other year and this is best decision we made. When first put the neck pillow on thought this is too big and not going to work. Then left it on and best sleep we have ever had on a flight. No head bobbing and waking up from that. Great support. Can move pillow around for different height if want that. Velcro is adjustable and keeps pillow in place. Highly recommend this!
"Bought to use for cross-Atlantic flights. Liked the sturdiness of the foam and the soft material cover, which can be removed and washed. The design is unique and elegant, but impractical for my needs. I have a short neck and one end of the pillow partially covered my ear, which made wearing either my noise cancelling headphones and earbuds (a must-have for me when flying) uncomfortable. Returned."
"First of all, I wanted to love this pillow. It came highly rated from multiple sources.I bought this for 9+ hour red-eye flights between the West Coast and London.Here are my observations:- Very awkward while in the storage bag. Because of its bulk, I had to tie it onto the outside of my messenger bag and it got caught on all kinds of things while moving thru the airport/onto the plane.- The pillow fits poorly & does not stay in place.- The pillow gets unpleasantly warm quite quickly (the foam holds heat).+ Cover fabric is very soft.When leaning my head towards the higher side of the pillow (as shown in the product video), it just slides over and tilts with the weight of my head, causing an uncomfortable position and unpleasant pressure against the opposite side of my neck.When leaning towards the low side of the pillow it didn’t slide/tip, but my face felt smooshed upwards and the pillow forced my earring to dig into my head.I have not yet found a way to get the pillow snug enough to stay in place without feeling like I am being smothered by the wrap portion that extends up above my chin.After trying to get this pillow positioned for over an hour, all I got was frustration & neck pain. I got zero sleep on the flight.All in all, this pillow was frustrating to use and completely underwhelmed me. If I hadn’t missed the return window. I would definitely send it back. Instead I’m out $60 and am stuck with a pillow I can’t use."
"I live in Hawaii, so any time I travel it is at least a 5 hour flight, and usually involves a red-eye.  After a fairly miserable trip to London, I decided to up the travel pillow game and give this a try.  I used it on a red-eye, and actually managed to sleep for about 4 hours.  I had a sleep mask, white noise on my headphones, and I don't know how, but I actually was fairly comfortable (even in the regular seats, not first class, def not lie-flat).  I just got back from another trip and decided to try this pillow again, even though it wasn't technically a red-eye.  I was pretty sure I wouldn't sleep, but I decided to try anyway.  I actually managed a couple of hours of sleep, which made a huge difference for my next day and recovery from jet lag."
The only pros for this pillow are the fact that the material it is made out of is very pleasant to the touch and the memory foam. The Velcro strap that the pillow has does not account for different neck lengths or head sizes. You cannot tighten or loosen the pillow around the neck at all without it unfurling.Leaning into either side of the pillow causes it to unfurl or significantly shift position because the Velcro is barely able to hold it closed.In short fantastic comfort of the outer material and memory foam but you’d be better off looking elsewhere in terms of actual functionality and support from a neck pillow.
"The Ostrichpillow Go is more like a pillow neck brace (cervical collar) than a traditional travel pillow.When I first put it on I said to my wife, I’m sending this back. But she encouraged me to try it for longer. So I did.What I found was the Ostrichpillow is a neck support device that’s ultra cushioned and soft. It provides support to your whole neck. I positioned myself in several ways and found, after adjusting it, no matter what way my neck drooped or fell, this device held it just right so my neck muscles wouldn’t tire and I could feel comfortable enough to doze off.The thing is with these pillows, ya gotta feel comfortable enough so your neck muscles can let go from supporting your head and allow it to comfortably relax which ever way it falls. Including when you droop forward or down. The trick with the Ostrichpillow Go is to fasten the cushion under your chin, then you have the support needed to let go any which way your head decides to fall. At least this is how it has seemingly worked for me. When I purposely put my head to either the left or right (the Ostrichpillow has high cut cushions) it feels like you are laying your head down on a regular pillow in bed. When I nudged my head forward the weight was taken by the front cushioned area that attaches across the front of your neck providing substantial support without feeling like you need to re-adjust. Essentially you can sit upright in a chair and drift off without the need of added support from a wall or chair back and whatever direction your head falls, you’re comfortably supported. It probably looks funny. But that’s why I’m stating this is more like a large cushioned cervical collar. I suppose my experience is anecdotal and you can only try it for yourself to know if it would work for you. But aside from having a long sleep in this, it has been an interesting experience and I really like it. My mid afternoon naps have been grand.The only drawback I have experienced is because the sides of this pillow are cut high, they leave little room for my earbuds (AirPods Pro). I manage, but I have to be mindful to push the buds close to my ears and make sure they’re under the pillow. It’s doable, but needs a little fiddling.I don’t know if this is the most comfortable neck pillow for me. I can’t buy them all and try them. Well, with Amazon that may be possible, but after using this for several naps I’m really liking it now. I don’t want to part with it.Recommended"
"I had the regular U shaped neck pillow and wanted something better for my overnight nonstop flight to Barcelona. It was super easy to adjust and I found a good position quickly! I love that the positions are endless and once in place, it stays in place! It was soft and didn‚Äôt have any shipping smells. Mine also came with the stitching that people mentioned but it not an issue and I don‚Äôt think will be. It‚Äôs sewn tightly. I definitely will be keeping this! I didn‚Äôt use the eye mask. Carrying case is great too."
"Initially, I received what looked like a returned item (1 star withheld for this inconvenience). However, I initiated, without issue, a return and replace with Amazon and a day and a half later I received a new pillow.The pillow itself is of a super soft material on the outside and not too firm memory foam on the inside. It holds its shape when placed around the neck and will fit plus sized persons as well without issue. It comes with a black drawstring bag for storage but also has a snap strap attached to the pillow itself for ease when travelling if you don‚Äôt want to travel with the drawstring bag (NB - the snap strap started fraying upon first use, the rest of the pillow stood up fairly well to international travel however). It also comes with a pair of single use earplugs and an ok eye mask. It‚Äôs a decent size all around and felt quite comfortable without feeling like it was trying to smother or choke me. It also feels  and looks to be a well made, quality product and value for money, but only time will really tell if it holds up to the true rigours of travel."
"Not every travel pillow is perfect for everyone.  I bought and tried many before my recent trip to Europe.  This one was the winner for me.  Adjustable, great support and not hot.  I especially like to double it up when sleeping with head to the side.  Great price to boot!  Only downside as others have mentioned is that it is bulky.  Case was nice but I may purchase a compression packing cube to see if I can make it smaller to carry next time."
