"Love the frames and they were exactly as described. I hated the protective film that is on the front and back of each frame's plexiglass.  It was hard to peel off and some didn't come off at all, I had to use a razor and peel up a corner to get it going. Other than that, perfect frames for our remodel"
"TheseThese frames do the job perfectly! They’re super easy to assemble and use plexiglass, which is ideal if you have kids (like I do). They arrived without any damage, thanks to the great packaging. Just be sure to remove the protective plastic film from both sides of the plexiglass before using. The images fit perfectly, and they look fantastic! I’d definitely buy them again—totally worth it!"
"Good quality for the price, they look very nice on my wall.  I have OCD and needed a matching set so this was perfect.  I kind of like that the front is plastic, less of a chance my kids break them (if they fall)"
These frames are great. The quality and value for the price is very good. I am very happy with this purchase and plan to purchase another set in the near future.
"They frames themselves look nicer than they actually are; I guess for the price it might be worth it; 4 of 5 stars.My biggest complaint is the ""nails"" that come with it; they don't ""push in"" to the hanger and because of that most of them can't even stick to the wall -- not sure the purpose of including these... might as well have left them out completely; minus 1 star for this flaw."
My mom passed away. I have few photos to remember her. These frames worked out amazingly.  Thank you so much. Better than the rest
"Hesitant to order these, but pleasantly surprised that they were so nice.  Well-made plastic frames, easy install of photos from rear with with nice locking devices.  Even clear glass (not plastic) ends up with a quality result.  Would definitely order again."
The gold frames look like they cost much much more than they did. The method of closing the photo into the frame is unique and usually used by products that are much more expensive.  Frames look very very nice on the wall in a grouping. Can also stand up alone on a table which is very nice. Sand is very strong.  Attractive and expensive looking hooks for hanging frames on the wall are also included.  I will be purchasing more of these gold frames.  They also come in additional colors.  A very very good buy.
"I stumbled upon the Upsimples 5x7 Picture Frame Set while on the hunt for frames to finally give life to some old photos that had been tucked away in storage. Let me tell you, these frames exceeded all my expectations and brought a warm, homely touch to my space. It would definitely work as a photo wall as well but I did not use it like that yet.. maybe in a future home.What drew me in right away was the affordability of the set.

"These frames are durable enough, and look sleek for the most part. The matte on them makes it look more high end. We have them for 2 gallery walls in our house, I‚Äôve actually ordered them 3 times because they‚Äôre so affordable. The frame itself will break easily if it falls off the wall which happened to a few of ours because of the kids. However, with a 10 pack we have a few as backup."
"Sturdy, light, great price, easily mountable or standing, all my frames are the same now, bought in each size"

"They look very nice and do not look like cheap frames, sturdy frames, worth buying!"
"Nicely built, great quality given the price, very well packaged against damage. A real value!"
I thought these frames were really cute. They were nice and bold and went along with my current set up on accent wall. I was a bit disappointed cause one of the frame glasses was broken. Otherwise it was a good purchase- I would still recommend :)
"I used these for my grandchildrens graduation photos, 10 of them."
"Great frames, good quality and sizes. Looks great on the wall for the collage look we were going for. The difference in sizes and portrait and landscape hanging is great.  I'd recommend for anyone looking to create this look on a wall, even in a smaller space"
"Because of the price I was expecting something cheap, I was ok with that as long as they looked ok from far away. But dang I was surprised. Light weight, sturdy, no cracks or paint discoloration. Every color was perfect.  The plastic that covers the picture is as clear as glass. Film was easy to take off just roll from the corner. I wasnâ€™t sure of the round pieces that came with it but apparently they replace nails for hanging. Seems to work pretty well so far. No complaints at all, Iâ€™m actually ordering another set right now. You definitely wonâ€™t regret it."
"These are super lightweight and easy to hang and they look so nice on the wall! My only complaint is the plastic cover in the front which makes a weird glare from the sides different than regular glass would. It bends a little and makes the picture look a little strange but for the price, theyâ€™re really good"
"These are not expensive frames. They are made of cheap wood and covered with paper for the ""wood grain"" effect.The 8x10s come with plastic instead of glass.However, inspite of those things, they look amazing! My review picture is the 8x10 with the plastic and you can't tell it isn't glass.Aside from a little minor touch up on the corners of the black frames, and a piece of glass that broke while cleaning (I had a spare broken frame, so I could easily use that piece of glass), these pictures frames are worth it.So, unless you are wanting very expensive frames and the potential troubles that may not exist don't buy these.But if you are willing to use a little permanent marker, if necessary, they are great frames and worth the money."
"I wanted an assortment of frames to make a gallery wall these are perfect. A good variety of color, size and orientation."
Given to our daughter as a birthday gift and she hasnâ€™t stole my phone since she got this! She loved taking photos on my phone and is now obsessed with her own camera that prints! And itâ€™s so cheap to refill the paper
"I love them, the plexy glass is fabulous. Easy to hang up very pretty"
I honestly donâ€™t know why I expected much more considering the price point but many reviews made me optimistic. They look very cheap. If you hang them where people canâ€™t get to close they might work fine but even from a couple feet away you can tell they are very cheaply made. They do not look like real rustic wood at all. They appear to look covered in a wood printed sticker or something. Returning.
This frame is so cool! Perfect size and color. I use it for my puppy’s pictures by the house entrance. Good quality and easy to move around. Good price!
Needed a specific size and this worked great!
Bought a couple to gift pictures from our wedding to family and everyone loved their gifts. The frame is nice quality and a great value.
I really like the 4x6 collage frame. Works great in my office.
"So clearly I did not read the full description for the sizing of this frame, based on the first picture I assumed it was slightly smaller, but I was pleasantly surprised as to how big it was, its actually really GORGEOUS! I’m glad I picked it but may have to rethink where to put it because the initial shelf I had in mind for it is a tad too small, but that’s not a complaint. This modern, chic frame goes perfect with the gold accents I have in my living space. I’ll update this review once I fill it with photos and find the best spot for it, but in the meantime don’t think twice, it’s a winner!"
I purchased as a gift for my fiancé. I was able to easily place the photos inside! It is a nice quality and versatile frame!
I love this frame for my office. Its cute and just what i needed. I plan on swapping my picturea out every few months.
My friend returned from a vacation and her birthday was coming up so I printed some of her vacation pictures and put them in this frame. It looked beautiful and she loved it!
"Mine came in perfect condition, perfect for 4 photos. It’s sturdy and easy to add photos! Very happy with my purchase."
I bought this as a gift and put family photos in it. It was very well received. Huge smiles.
I was looking for a frame to hold multiple pictures. This frame is exactly as described.
One of the reasons I bought this was because it holds both horizontal and vertical pictures.
"Good quality.  Fit the pictures size well, looks great.  Glass was think and seemed to be picture protection great worth the price i couldn't even find any at stores like this or cute"
"The frames looks beautiful on the desk. Quality is amazing, its the perfect Gold."
I really love the look of these gold frames.  My daughter’s ballet pictures look great in them.
Nice stand-up double frame.  Suits the images of our twin grandsons perfectly.  We found the little metal tabs that hold the pictures in a bit hard to handle as we have relatively poor eyesight for tiny things.
Good value for the money. Arrived in good packaging and in good shape
"We, sadly, had to put down our old dog. I wanted a simple way to be able to see her face to remember her so I got this frame (plus three more for our other dogs) and they were the perfect size for their pictures and little paw prints 💖"
One of the problems with these hinged picture frames is that the hinges tend to be flimsy.  I was buying this product to replace another frame with bent and loose hinges.  The hinges on this frame seem sturdier.
It was picture frame it did it’s prepose / cheaply made
"Good, really inexpensive. Frame colors were perfect for my project. I don't think it's real wood & plexiglass is used instead of real glass. But I like them, good value."
Beautiful & go great on my well. I love the mix of colors.
"These look great, the colors and tones were as pictured and described. Two of them were broken or coming apart at the corners, where it‚Äôs basically stapled together. It‚Äôs not real wood. A little super glue worked fine, and I was able to hang them ok. They looked great, and for the price are what I‚Äôd expect."
"I didn't realize when ordering these that they had plastic instead of glass, however it was a pleasant surprise.  If they are knocked over, they will not have shattered glass everywhere.  I have them for my office for my diplomas and certificates.  The different colored frames make for a great match to nearly any decor."
Good quality and price!
"So these are very pretty - and they are great for hanging on the wall. A couple of things - one is that this is not glass - and the plastic comes with film on it that you have to peel off, which takes a while, so make sure you have patience to do that (and finger nails!!!). Also, the stands in the back aren't really long enough, so if you're trying to set this on something instead of hanging it on a wall, the picture frame tips waaaaay waaaay back and looks kind of stupid. So, if you have patience and just want to hang these on the wall, they're great. Otherwise, maybe look for something else."
Exactly what I was looking for
Good quality
Nothing fancy. Good enough to put on a wall
"I absolutely love these picture frames! They’re the perfect blend of simplicity and elegance, making them an ideal addition to any room in my home. I’ve used them to display cherished family photos, and they truly enhance the overall aesthetic of the pictures.What I Appreciate:Sleek Design: The clean, white frame with a smooth finish complements any style of decor, whether modern or traditional. It has a timeless look that doesn’t distract from the photo itself but instead enhances it.High-Quality Materials: The frames feel sturdy and well-made. The glass is crystal clear, protecting the photos beautifully without any distortion or glare.Versatile Display Options: I love that these frames come with both an easel back for tabletop display and hooks for wall mounting. It gave me the flexibility to mix and match how I wanted to display my photos in different spaces.Perfect Size: The size is ideal for standard 4x6 or 5x7 photos, making it easy to swap pictures without needing custom prints.A Small Suggestion:The back stand can be a little snug when you’re first setting up the frame, but once it’s in place, it’s very secure. It’s not a major issue, but something to be mindful of if you’re handling fragile prints.Overall, these frames are an excellent choice for showcasing your favorite memories. They’re stylish, affordable, and versatile. Whether you’re displaying family portraits, travel photos, or art prints, these frames are sure to add a touch of class to any space. Highly recommend—five stars!"
"I bought this frame to put My baby paw print that passed away last month. So here is my review. It looks decent and sturdy and holds up well on the wall,so what more could I ask for. The only con is that the pexi glass is super paper thin, and feels fragile. Also peeling the plastic on it its a huge pain. Wish the glass was more thicker. Now the second frame I got it came with some scratches and small tear and wear. Other than that it is a good inexpensive picture frame that does the job."
"I was looking for a small frame with plexiglass instead of real glass.  This 2-pack fit the bill perfectly.  Nothing fancy here, but these are nice for a cost-effective way to frame a favorite 5x7 photo for self or to gift.  And the plexiglass makes them break-resistant, which was important for me as this was going to a relative in a dementia care unit where the frame could easily be mishandled.  So if you are looking for a no-frills, but nice looking and ""safe"" framing option, I would certainly recommend these."
These are great frames . Light weight yet sturdy. Priced right . Will order more .
"I kept the frames because it was too much of a hassle to return, but I will never buy them again. Although they look fantastic, they are not very strong. They do not sit correctly on the table because there’s a strap in the back that is a little to tight so the frames can’t widen the way they should to be able to be stable on the table.  It’s still a nice looking frame though, but I think the quality is very cheap. But …..you can’t ask for much for that little Price."
The frames were perfect.  'Thanks.
"These picture frames work well, but the quality is not super great. They do not feel super durable, but they are working for what I needed them for."
This set is as light as a frame can get! I could not go to the dollar store so I got these for x2 picture I needed to frame.As most modern frames no glass but plastic. Better as there is no risk of injury or shatter. For everyday pic it is a good deal.
Good frame. I left the pictures in and people think I have a good looking family.
"Nice plain frame with virtually unbreakable ""glass"" in front. Frame itself is plastic, if that matters to you. Nicely finished. This pkg is a set of 2."
"The frames are a bit flimsy and its not glass, its like fiberglass or something. Once pictures are in it looks fine and you cant tell but the flip stands that hold the fram up are also very cheap the frames tip over easily."
"This was surprisingly larger than i expected, which i loved so I included a picture with sunglasses in front to reference size. It‚Äôs very bright and good quality, which you can dim, and its touch screen! You can rotate videos and pictures. It‚Äôs easy to set up/use! It has a lot of modifications so that‚Äôs good. The screen has the weather, time, and date the picture or video showing date included."
I have purchased 3 more of these for Christmas gifts. Very easy to set up and such a sweet gift to give someone. Memories to look back on and retell a story from that moment you captured.
"I ordered one of these and loved it so much that I ordered 5 more for family Christmas gifts.  The price is perfect.  I am currently scanning old family pics and plan to load se of the to each frame to personalize the gift.  I know my sisters, nephew, and daughters will love this gift.  I am thinking about ordering one for my grandson for his apartment and loading it with his car pics.  Family pics wouldn't do anything for him.  If it's not a car, he doesn't want to look at it.  Lol"
Love that I can add and delete pics in a pinch and that friends and families can do the same via a link.  Super easy to use.  Love Love Love IT!
It works well. It was easy to set up & use. These are great to give out as gifts. Highly recommended
Love this product ! Super easy to use .
