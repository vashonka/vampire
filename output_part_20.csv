"Great for snow, dirt or rain. Comfy and pretty light tow wear. Also surprisingly warm for low temperatures."
"I love these boots. Lightweight and so comfortable. Columbia does the best overall for comfort, toughness, tread and flexibility. Bravo."
"These boots are durable, a very comfortable fit and light weight.  Waterproof and love the color."
fits size 12 okay
Columbia hiking boots are my favorite brand.I ordered 10.5 W. However they sent me the size 10.5 ; as a result i returned because I need wide size.
Bought these because I was going to a beach concert that was expecting a lot of rain. These were extremely comfortable to wear and walk in all day long. They kept the water out as it started raining. My feet were about the only thing dry by the end of the day!
These have held up amazing. My feet aren’t cold they’re not falling apart. Comfortable. I will definitely be buying again once I need a new pair.
"This shoes are great.i love them very much and it’s my first pair of shoes from that model, I have another shoes from Columbia.They are very beautiful and very comfortable and lightweight….I really recommend to buy them because you can wear them to hiking or in the city"
"Very good quality shoe. Comfortable, reliable on rough and difficult terrain. Light weight but provide max support and grip required for long and tough trekking. Value for money. Fit as expected."
"I bought these boots for my job, I am a landscaper. The Timberland Men's Mt. Maddsen Mid Waterproof Hiking Boot is a fantastic choice for outdoor enthusiasts. The boots are incredibly comfortable, providing excellent support for long days outside. The waterproof feature kept my feet dry even during wet conditions, and the durable construction gave me confidence on rocky and uneven terrain. The traction is superb, ensuring a steady grip with every step. Overall, these boots combine style, comfort, and functionality, making them a must-have for any landscaper Highly recommend!Money well spent."
Lightweight but sturdy . Fit true to size . Real leather .Very comfortable and plenty of toe room . Good arch and good sturdy  sole .  Great value ... My husband says the weight of the boot is great .
"I usually go with mid tear boot brands such as ""Free Soldier"" which have always served me well till last purchase  - out of box they made feet hurt & the darn squeak sound made in heal....sounded like they were filled with water so freaking OCD annoying so it was time for upgrade to Timberland.Timberland boot construction is top notch built to last with real leather , excellent fit ,no foot hurt & no darn squeak sound.Their very good looking as well ,use them for casual wear & out on trails.Their best boots I've ever owned & my new go too."
"I work in an ice rink so my feet can get cold and wet all the time however, these boots are great at keeping my feet warm and dry. They are also very comfortable and fit great as I have a wide foot.Would 100% recommend these boots to anyone.One month update: Not too happy about laces as they are already fraying and one of the tips just failed after one month of wearing 3-4 times a week.## Downgrade from Five stars to Four stars ##"
"Bought a pair of these eight years ago and it seems they haven't messed them up with the version currently available.  Very comfortable to wear and roam around in.  Only issue I have had is walking on wet rocks the traction isn't the greatest and I have fallen because of that.  Fortunately, I don't find myself on wet rocks that often, so these have proven to be decent all around shoes.  Hopefully this new pair will last another eight years."
"I was looking for a light weight boot I could wear while doing work out in the fields. I needed something with full leather to help protect against snake bites but not be heavy. These fit well. My heel is comfortable and secure. There seems to be more room in the foot area but I don’t move around in them. They fit true to size for Timberlands. They are quite aggressive on the bottom and should give great tractions. But the weight is the greatest part. My 6 inch Timberlands weigh 2lbs 1.4 ounces per boot. These weigh 1lb 1.1 ounces per boot. Exactly what I wanted. If you are looking for a light weight, stylish boot, then these are a very good option."
"I live where winter is 6 months out of the year and these boots are so good, I just ordered a second pair. When they mean non-slip, it includes ice. Still take your time on slippery surfaces but the traction is like having winter tires in your feet. And If you’re 6’3, 275 pounds and need a size 13, they are more comfortable AND supportive than any other shoe that I own. I wore out the other pair out last year because they were on my feet almost every moment I wasn’t indoors, for 7 months from October-April. Plus I got to order them in all black this time. 5 out of 5."
"They are waterproof as they claim. The leather lasts. I wore these for two years straight doing yardwork around my house. Rode 60+ miles on a horse in Wyoming, walked in snow and mud and never had a leak or wet feet.I suggest putting some insoles in them just for more arch support because they are a bit flat.Not too heavy and good tread.The rubber toe protector came loose on my first pair, the second pair is fairly new so we'll see.Overall, I would highly recommend. Definitely invest in some foot powder if they're your everyday camp shoes. My feet never got hot but they are waterproof so the ""stink"" stays in the shoe."
"I waited a bit before reviewing so I had a chance to properly test it.  This is the most comfortable hiking boot I have owned.  I even will just wear them when walking the dog around the neighborhood because they are more comfortable than my sneakers and have way more traction on gravel/dirt.  Very happy with my purchase, especially considering the price point.EDIT - DECEMBER 31, 2023:  I had the chance to take these boots with me for a European tour and they continue to impress.  Used them for walking miles on the cobblestone streets and climbing up to the ruins of castles on the side of mountains.  They worked great.  So comfortable I didn't mind using them as my every day footwear for three weeks.  My feet never hurt and they provided good traction on the trails and stones covered in snow."
"I had to up my review for a couple reasons noted in the comments with an * * The customer service is outstanding with this company!!1. Yes, the toe box is a little big, but not a biggie, you can wiggle your toes and still enough room with the socks I've been wearing with them (Carhartt Thermal Wool Socks). * I added a running shoe insole to the top of the insole they have, which makes a phenomenal difference in the feel of the toe box and makes the fit feel a little more secure and snug so you don't feel like the boot is slipping.2. Will they keep your feet warm and dry even when the temperature is -25F? - Dry, so far so good walking in Snow and puddles of water from runoff. * After wearing them in more than ankle deep snow for a while and such, haven't had an issue with wet feet at all... - Warm even when the temperature is -25F ... I very seriously doubt it ... I take my dog for a walk about a mile 3 or 4 times a day, lately in the snow.  The coldest it's been is about 0 degrees F with an approximate -18F wind chill ... they're better than my moderate temperature tactical boots yes, but did they keep my feet warm and cozy ... NO ... took her out a little bit ago at +22F, in the sun and my feet still got cold, especially the toes and bottoms of my feet, with thermal wool socks ... so if you're looking for something that will keep your feet (especially toes and bottoms of your feet) warm at -25F ... these aren't going to do that trick... * After wearing them for a while in cold temperatures ( below zero Fahrenheit with an 18 to 20 below wind chill), then wearing my tactical boots out in the cold ... phenomenal difference ... they seem to keep the feet pretty warm, toes get a little cold but not so much that you feel like your toes are freezing.3. Comfort- They're fairly comfortable, not as much as they advertise ... a lot has to do with the boot laces they use, they keep coming untied ... I typically double wrap my top lace and double tie the loop ... they still came loose.  Think I'm going to make some laces out of some 550 Paracord like I have in the past so they'll stay tight on my feet. * After wearing them for a while, putting the running shoe insole in, they are much more comfortable, still not a fan of the boot laces they come with, but 550 Paracord will remedy that.. üòäThe price was really good (although shortly after I received them the price dropped over $9 üëø**I was in total shock when I received a message from their customer service (Top Shoe) who offered a full refund or they would send me another pair or a different boot to see if I would be more satisfied with those.Upon my request to try a different boot, they sent me a mid-ankle hiking boot (looks similar to this one with a lower ankle and less insulation).I did have to do the same thing, putting in a running shoe insole to make the fit a little more snug and secure.I have to say, after making some slight adjustments (running shoe insoles and Paracord laces), I am thoroughly happy with both pairs of boots.I would imagine a lot of the 'toe box' might have to do with a persons individual foot, it might be perfect for some but need some adjustments for others.All in all, I have to say they are top notch products that appear to be well made and seem as though they'll hold up well.  I've been switching back and forth between the boots depending on the weather and have actually decided that I may very well be looking into purchasing some of their other lines of boots as Spring and Summer approach."
These boots fit more like a shoe. You can easily drive with them on. They are the most comfortable boot I have worn. I have feet problems with arthritis. There are no rough spots inside. The lining is very soft. The arch is very suportive. The boots are nicely insulated but they don't have too much insulation so you can wear them inside for a reasonable amount of time without getting your feet too hot.
"Just got these boots and they fit well. I haven‚Äôt broken them in yet but seem comfortable. Once it cools down some i will wear them and post any updates here if not satisfied, but I believe they will be fine.I wore these boots on a long walk with my dog today. They fit well and were comfortable to walk in. Still too warm for winter conditions, but I think they‚Äôll be great. The price was right."
"Quality well beyond the price. Warm, comfortable, waterproof with a very comfortable foot bed."
These were a gift.  He reports that they‚Äôre warm and comfortable and loves that they‚Äôre waterproof. I loved the range of sizes.
"I just received my Nortiv8 boots and they are impressive right out of the box.  They appear well-made, look great, come in a box like in a shoe store, even come with an extra pair of laces.  Putting them on is easy because of the way they open up with laces that are designed to allow you to put your foot in them without twisting and stuffing them in.  I typically wear size 10.5 in my street shoes and bought these in size 11 to have the extra room needed for thick socks and to allow for warm air pockets.  I can wiggle my toes and they are wide enough for my medium width feet to have plenty of room without too much space, and there is no slipping on my heel.  They have a label of waterproof and are insulated with Thinsulate, which will be perfect for winter hiking in the colder, below freezing temperatures, snow and muck on rock trails.  While I believe these will wear and hold up well for my daily 4-5 mile trail hikes, only time will tell.  But on first impression wearing these around the house, I am extremely impressed with the quality and fit of this boot.  I give these 5 stars+ at this point."
Got a half size bigger. Thinking he would need more room for thicker socks but I didn't.. It's true size. They are warm and keep his feet dry. Got 2 shoe laces. Comfortable to walk long distance
They look so clean. Only thing I wish is to that it was more comfortable on the inside but I bough insoles to make them more comfortable other then that clean durable and warm.
"These boots are amazing  quality. Live in novsscotia  ,where the weather  can get crazy. These boots are tough ,comfortable, and warm.I,m very picky about my boots.Finally found  the only boots I will ever own again. Thanks  for such  a great product."
"I recently purchased the Nortiv 8 Men's Winter Snow Boots, and I couldn't be happier with my decision! The boots are incredibly well-made, offering excellent insulation and waterproofing, which is perfect for the harsh winter conditions. They are also surprisingly comfortable, making long walks a breeze.What really impressed me was the delivery service. The boots arrived exactly on time, as promised.The packaging was secure, and the boots were in perfect condition upon arrival.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with both the product and the service. I would highly recommend Nortiv 8 to anyone in need of reliable winter footwear."
"These Boots are very comfortable, didn't have to break them in at all. With all the rain we're having my feet have not gotten wet. They look really nice, and they seem to be made very good. I've only had these boots for a couple of days but if they last for any length of time I will probably buy these again. Also, the fit is accurate to their chart."
"These are great - comfortable, not too heavy but sturdy. I walk 2 miles to & from work each day in NY city and these are by far my favorite shoes. I already bought a backup pair for when these are done. My only complaint is that the tread did wear out a bit quickly (about 10 months) but in all fairness, I do a lot of walking and they are probably designed for dirt & grass, not the concrete jungle."
"I love the fit, comfort, and support this boot provides. I put hard miles on these boots and they hold up well. I do between five to eight miles a day of vigorous hill walking. I am very satisfied with these boots."
"Purchased July 2022 in a rush to take on family vacation so that I could wear/pack just one pair of shoes. Being new, these worked perfectly for casual dining appearance, lounging around the cabins, limited hiking, riverbank fishing, light rain, dirt or mud conditions forecast. I did a minimum amount of online research for the most positive buyer feedback at lowest cost. These were priced at only 89.95 at the time.I've owned several boots and similar casual hikers over 45+ years. They usually start breaking down within 6-9 months. I have fallen arches, plantar fasciitis on left foot, right foot one size wider and shorter than the left, so sizing is often a crap shoot. These fit snug and comfortable enough with decent grip and ankle/foot support right out of the box. No break-in necessary, as others have said. They were subpar, as expected, on the few longer steep, rocky inclines I came across. Just not rigid enough so the balls of my feet and arches tired quickly. They make a GREAT hiker/walker on every other flat or hilly terrain. I liked them enough after vacation to make them my everyday shoe.  I've been wearing these almost every day to work; standing/walking on concrete and asphalt 9-10 hours/day, 4 days/week, and hiking, walking, shopping on days off work for 18 months.They've been warm in moderately cold weather (+10°) and not overly hot in Texas weather. Decent moisture wicking/breathing kept feet pretty dry. The traction/tread did wear enough by 12-13 months to make walking on wet rocks or slippery surfaces overly treacherous but that's better life than most. My heel has worn the lining of both insoles but not all the way through; no uncomfortable folds or lumps underfoot; a welcome surprise given experience with others. The stitching, glue, outsoles have held far better than most! Shockingly, no separations between outsole and footbed. No deep cracks in bottom of soles. Even the toe bumper has not shown any separation.  This suede upper DID show permanent wrinkles on the tops of toe/foot more quickly (1-2 months) than most others but not terribly ugly while wearing, as you might guess from my photos. How these could be called ""waterproof"" being suede with no Gortex or similar layer, I don't know. My waterproof expectations were reasonably low reading the specs, so was prepared for disappointment. They ARE nicely water ""resistant"" in light rain, light snow conditions or even a (very) quick hosing off but with heavy rain or stepping into water the wet and cold is felt in socks and feet within seconds or a few minutes of saturation.My single ""complaint"" is that, for some reason, in my house with these shoes on I am a walking electrostatic lightning rod. To walk from couch a short distance across carpet I must discharge/ground myself before touching or kissing anyone or anything or receive a painful surprise zap! We must have a unique combination of furniture covering, blankets, carpet, otherwise there would be more reviewers mentioning this.As far as care; I hosed them off with any heavy mud or grass stains and brushed them maybe 8 times. There's not much support left in the footbed/soles at this point and they started squeaking when I walk at 14-15 months in but I'm very satisfied with the quality and value I got from them. If I can't find something better, I may purchase again even at the $10-20 higher current price tag."
"I wanted to get a standalone pair of shoes to wear for hiking and walking my doggo. I used to just walk in whatever pair of shoes were on my feet, it could've been some vans, airforces, and they would definitely do the job, but I would end up beating up my shoes more than they deserved.So this brought me to purchasing the columbia newton ridge. I bought the grey and maroon color, and in person it looks quite nice. I've had these now for a few months and have take them on very gravely course terrain, and they have exceeded my expectations.The ankle support is good, and the outsole has very durable lugs built in that provide good traction for various types of terrain.Overall, very happy with my purchase, and highly recommend it!"
This is a comfortable boot with a good fit for hiking.  The price was so reasonable for a boot of this quality.  Purchased for a trip to Colorado and wore on a hike to the top of Quandary Peak Trail.  The boots felt great.
These boots fit like a glove right out of the box. Walked several miles in them the same day they were delivered. Like walking on air!Highly recommended.
These boots are the most comfortable boots I have. They are great for hiking and contractors utility. I have worn down my original tan ones and purchased two more. They are waterproof and have great traction on slick surfaces.
Product looks great and fits well
"These boots are very comfortable.  2 day shipping!  They are well made and look great too.  I have tried many brands and these are by far the best bang for your buck.  I had to order the wide in these because I have wide feet and they are plenty wide enough.  I like the quick release lace notches at the top because they make it really easy to lace them to the correct tightness and easy to take on and off.  They have awesome tread on the bottom and are non-slip on all terrain.  They are so comfortable out of the box that they don't need different insoles; I usually put running insoles in all my boots/shoes.  These are my 2nd pair of Nortiv 8 boots.  I liked my Black Nortiv 8 tactical boots so much, I had to have these stylish hiking boots for casual wear.  The black Nortiv 8 tactical boots have held up very well over the last 6 years and I still have them.  These style boots look great and are for everyday wear, work, or hiking.  I love them and I highly recommend these boots!  You can't beat the price on them either!"
"Boots fit good, was very comfortable, the arch support wasn't too big so my orthotics worked perfectly! Too much arch support and my orthotics over correct and my knees hurt. Boots don't feel heavy,  they look good and the price is right! I love the green color too."
"This is the 2nd pair of Nortiv boots I have purchased ""although this is a different style and boot then my previous pair"". So far after a couple weeks of daily use up to 8-9 hours a day at work as a mechanic they have held up great. They do say waterproof however I always coat my boots with a quality waterproofing spray ""as I do all boots, shoes, sneakers..etc"" to give them an added protectant and they stay looking clean and newer for much much longer. My only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that the laces continue to come undone and you are  constantly having to tie them. Would not be an issue if you double knot them however then they would be difficult to remove at the end of the work day. They are comfortable and have great traction and have kept my feet fully dry ""even when the boots are completely soaked"" and they are fully dry on the exterior the next morning when I'm getting ready for work. I do wish I stuck with just a size 12 and not the 12 wide as they are a bit  to wide ""I usually buy wide if there is an option in the past with no issues"". That being said you can't beat the quality for the price, even if they only last me 6 months in my work environment I would consider it a win and would order another pair."
"I was instantly blown away by the rigidity and ruggedness of these boots, as well as how comfortable and well fitting they are. They are definitely rugged and stiff - in a good way. Very supportive boot and look great too. They feel more like a boot that would cost 2 or 3 times what they do. Very pleased and will be purchasing more form NORTIV 8 ASAP"
"I bought these to replace an old pair of combat boots for doing work around the house. Once I tried these on that plan changed and I am wearing these all the time now. Very comfortable, water- proof, and well made and a great price. Would definitely buy these again."
"I'm a hard core hiker with decades of using a variety of boots with Keen being my favorite, but also expensive.  I saw these on Amazon and after reading good reviews thought I'd give them a try since the price was very good.  Wow, I'm very happy with these boots!  They fit very well and are a bit higher than other boots which I find helpful in keeping rocks and dirt from getting inside the boot.  They have held up over several months of daily use and in wet conditions.  They are light yet strong in supporting your feet and seem very durable.  Highly recommended."
"Nice boot and very well built visually but not as comfortable as I thought.  Bought it based on the reviews of other ""customers"".  There's a part of the tongue that was pressing against my foot that is painful to wear on my left foot.  This is my second shoes from this brand and will be the second shoes I'm returning.  No more buying from this brand.  I hate to buy products and returning it."
"I just spent a week hiking rocky volcanic slopes in Northern New Mexico and fishing streams and lakes in that area, and these boots impressed me! Feet stayed dry and comfortable while other members of the group complained in the evenings of sore feet after climbing up and down steep inclines. Ankle support is good but still allows a bit of flex for enjoyable climbing and hiking. I walked for miles each day (sometimes in rain) on very uneven terrain and never got wet feet or blisters. Multiple trips through shallow water that covered the foot part of the boot proved that the waterproof claim is legit. The soles are softer than older style boots and look and feel more like running shoe soles. I did step down on a few sharp edged rocks descending hillsides that I could feel through the soles, but my feet were always comfortable. A variety of short cactus varieties are scattered on the ground in the area, but I never had spines penetrate the boots or create problems. One evening I stepped into water that was deeper than I thought, and it flooded one boot. I removed the insole and let the boot air out overnight and it was dry enough to wear comfortably for the rest of the week without problems. Even with plenty of abuse and water, the boots are ready for the next challenge. These are the most comfortable ""real"" boots I've worn in a long time, and I will order again when these eventually wear out."
"After reading many reviews and the note on the item page saying that they generally fit to size, I picked up a pair of 9.5 black boots (with some grey trim) as I dig anything in black. If Batman wore a hiking shoe, this would be it. The stitching is well done and the fabric looks great - they don't look poorly made by any means. They appear to be water proof/resistant up to about half-way up the boot, at which point the water would seep in through the top - they aren't hip gaitors or water boots, so I wouldn't expect them to handle much more than a few inches deep puddle/mud. They feel super comfortable underneath my feet and around the sides - nothing awkwardly poking into the arch of my foot or the sides of my ankles. While I did pick my usual size, they do feel *ever so slightly roomy* - but I am wearing super thin socks and if I were wearing a thicker pair, I'm sure the shoe would be filled out a bit more. Also, I feel like if I got a smaller size AND wore a thicker pair of socks, I would find it slightly cramped. Also! Hiking tends to make your feet a bit bigger from the bloodflow so I think it's a good call to settle on a little roomy rather than a perfect fit when you're at home on a couch. I like how easily they go on/come off - you don't have to do much lacing/delacing or do any forcing of your foot into it. You can feel that the sole is made from different materials in different spots - treads are made of a rubber to give you grip where the rest of the sole is made from a harder material to make the soles last longer. Toe cap for a bit of protection/grip/easier ascents. Comes with an extra pair of laces. The photo on the item page does it fair justice but if I get around to pulling out my camera, I'll add a few photos of the shoes before I begin destroying them.All in all - super happy with my purchase and I trust they will serve me well on my thru-hike of the WCT in a month. Thanks for the sick boots, Nortiv8!"
"I have wide feet and they fit perfectly. They have a good grip, are warn and and great looking."
They are what I was looking for  thankS
"i’ve now had the Nortiv 8 Men's Waterproof Hiking Boots for a full month, and I can confidently say they have exceeded my expectations. Over the past 30 days, I’ve tested them both indoors and outdoors in a variety of conditions, including sub-zero temperatures (around -5°C), rain, sun, and cold weather, and they’ve handled everything exceptionally well.ComfortFirst off, these boots are incredibly comfortable right out of the box. I had no issues with break-in time, which is a huge plus. The cushioning inside is just the right balance—not too soft, but still supportive enough for long hours of walking. I wore them for several long indoor walks and outdoor treks with no discomfort or irritation. The mid-cut design provides just enough ankle support, while still allowing for good mobility.WarmthOne of the main reasons I chose these boots was for their ability to keep my feet warm in colder weather. And they definitely deliver. Even in temperatures as low as -5°C, my feet stayed comfortably warm and dry. The waterproof lining ensures that snow and slush don’t seep in, which is crucial during cold weather hikes. The insulation isn’t too heavy, though, so I imagine these will be fine for moderate temperatures as well. They strike a great balance between warmth and breathability.Weather ResistanceThe waterproofing has been stellar. I wore them through rainy days, trudging through puddles and wet grass, and my feet stayed dry the entire time. The boots performed just as well in the snow, where the tread gave me excellent grip and traction. The boots have a rugged, slip-resistant outsole that works well on slick surfaces, offering great confidence even when navigating wet or icy patches.DurabilityAfter a month of regular use in a variety of environments, they show minimal signs of wear. The upper material still looks great—no fraying or tears—and the rubber sole has maintained its structure, showing no signs of softening or losing traction. The stitching is solid, and I haven’t experienced any issues with the waterproof membrane.VersatilityI’ve used these boots for hiking, walking, and even casual outings. They’re versatile enough to handle trails, city streets, and even some light climbing. Plus, their stylish design doesn’t scream “hiking boot,” so they look good even off the trail.ConclusionThe Nortiv 8 Men's Waterproof Hiking Boots have really impressed me after a month of wear. Whether it’s enduring cold, wet, or sunny conditions, these boots are comfortable, functional, and durable. If you’re looking for a boot that can handle a variety of environments while keeping your feet warm, dry, and supported, I highly recommend these. They’ve definitely earned a permanent place in my outdoor gear collection.buy them i paied 37 they pop up for 33 from time to time"
"I ordered the Merrell maob 3 mid in 11.5 wide.  The fit was fine, but when I put on thicker socks it was a bit snug.  Changing to 12 wide worked perfectly, it gave me a little more toe room that benefits from thicker socks for fall and winter walking.  Sole of the shoe when walking is slightly firmer than expected, but was mentioned in reviews;  I hope it breaks in a bit and softens up with some miles on them.  Very happy at the price point of just above $100.  Solid shoe and I'm happy with them.Update 08/31/2024.  These are great mid hiking shoes........but I found amazing boots a day later.  Go to REI buy a lifetime membership (30 bucks) and buy something cheap.  Go back after 24 hours and buy a set of Danner 600 leaf GTX hiking boots for men (grizzly brown/Rodeo Red) and get $30 off.  My boot code was ""62302"".  They are on sale until September  2nd 2024 for $164, but if you get a member card and use it 24 hours later, you get lifetime membership and $30 off and you get these AMAZING  boots for 132 and tax.  If you have 11.5 in 4EE feet you will thank me later.  If you have narrower feet stick with the maob 3 mids for half the price.  I bought a pair of Danners 20 years ago and they are still amazing.  No shade for the Merrell Moab 3, but for a wide foot the 62302 Danner is like a silk slipper. OMG I love these boots, I am so sorry Merrell......... but I found true love."
"Just a great boot! Light, comfortable and well made. I‚Äôve had several pairs of these and each one has been perfect fit."
"These hiking boots are incredibly comfortable and provide excellent support. They have been tested them in wet conditions, and they truly are waterproof, keeping my husband‚Äôs feet dry throughout the hike. The grip is solid, even on rocky trails, and they feel durable enough for many adventures. A must-have for any hiking enthusiast!"
"Loved everything about these boots including the color, durability, easy to break in, decently lightweight and comfortable. Only negative is after a long hike feet felt quite warm, little ventilation but thats probably with most hiking shoes"
"The Merrell brand was recommend to me by a friend. I had never heard of Merrell before. I received these boots just 5 minutes ago and put them on immediately.I purchased the ""Earth"" color (brown) and the boots look real handsome! I don't see any obvious flaws and they seem to be sturdy and very well-constructed. However, I will need to wear these Merrell boots exclusively for the next few months to see if anything defective develops.SIZE INFO: I usually wear a size 10 or 10.5, depending on boot/shoe manufacturer. My friend recommend that I size-up just a little when purchasing this Merrell boot. Good Advice!I think at least one reviewer said that these boots run very large. This is NOT true in my case. I purchased size 10.5 M and they fit absolutely perfect.The boots are quite comfortable and have noticeable arch support.Although only extensive use of an item like this (clothes, shoes) really determines their durability and value, at this point I rate these Merrell boots 5 stars.Regarding Waterproofing:I always spray my suede/smooth leather boots and shoes with the common silicone boot waterproofing spray. It protects the leather and makes it last longer. Reapply every year.I recommend these boots."
"I hesitated before buying these, as I had a pair of low Merrells that were not comfortable nor waterproof.  I I was a faithful Timberland buyer, but they have really cheapened their boots. So, I finally broke down and bought these as they come in a wide width and were rated fairly highly on several different ""best of"" reviews. They were comfortable right out of the box. Wore them to mow very wet grass and feet remained dry (only time will tell how they fare in Adirondack weather). I also wore them on a hike into a remote lake up north, good traction and protective footbed. The price is moderate, there are cheaper boots, but these seem pretty rugged in comparison. I hope to get several years out of them."
I love these boots for the summer months. They are waterproof but handle the heat very well. They are light weight and comfortable for racking up miles quickly in.
"I've been wearing Merrell Mid hiking shoes since 2016. My previous two pairs were Moab 2, and I've been very happy with the wear, fit and waterproof qualities. Right out of the box, I noticed that the Moab 3 looks to be even sturdier then the Moab 2. The sole has a more aggressive tread and the toe and heel are more reinforced. The fit is sturdy and the insert seems to have a more significant arch support. I read some reviews reporting that the sizing runs a little small, and I notice that they seem to fit snug, but that might be because they are new.Some reviews report that they are not waterproof; as of this writing, I haven't had an opportunity to test that facet. I don't use Merrell's for necessarily just hiking, but more of a daily wear during the colder seasons and inclement weather (although I do occasionally hike with these). They have always been very comfortable, so I am looking forward to the Moab 3. I will update this review, once I have experienced wet conditions and after a break-in period."
This is the fourth pair of these hikers from this company I've bought over the years. I walk on average 1000 miles a year in the forest and get the best life out of these over any other like product. Very comfortable at any temperature for me from +95 down to -30. Haven't found anything yet that would make me change.
"So have worn the Newton Ridge Plus for some 10 pair or so.  If memory serves they were just Newton Ridge (non Plus) for the first few pair, but that was some time ago!  I keep buying them as they do it all right. Waterproof, Support, Last a year of ~10K steps / day.  My go to work, play and away boot.I actually got this pair for a workmate that had gotten boots from a local big box and the sole broke after 3 months, twice in a row.  I could not take it anymore and had to get him a real pair of boots.  He's doing fine in these.  You probably would too.I don't have a break in period with these.  They feel comfortable and work right and can be worn to work the day you take them out of the box."
"These shoes feel fantastic!  They are very true to size, and they fit me just perfectly.  The craftsmanship and design look wonderful, and I haven't seen or experienced any issues with them so far.  I ordered these as hiking boots, and possibly as winter boots, but they look so nice, I kind feel bad about possibly scuffing them up!The support around the ankle area seems adequate to me, but I immediately removed the insoles from these shoes.  They're just thin pads, and although they were comfortable, they didn't provide the arch support I wanted.  I had some high arch insoles that slid right in, and now I'm ready to go.  I tend to overpronate, especially with my left foot, due to a prior injury, but with the insoles in these, and the added support around the ankle, these should be just great for me!Awesome quality, stylish appearance, and a great value, in my opinion!"
"This is my second pair. They fit my foot perfectly. My job requires me to stand all day. These boots are way more comfortable than tennis shoes. Secondly, I wore them hunting and they are way better than the $300 to 500 huntimg boots. They handle walking on rocks better than Merril hiking shoes. For the price, These are amazing shoes. Im buying a third pair now."

TLDR: Tongue is a bit water resistant, outsole has soft rubber (potential durability issues), eh plastic coated leather, comfortableThe important thing to note is that this shoe is not a workhorse boot. If you were planning to wear this for an everyday 9-5 warehouse job, serious hikes often, or for labor work every other day, this shoe isn't for you. While the shoe is decent, it lacks the longevity that you want in a workhorse shoe. It does work in a pinch, but expect the outsole to wear out quickly and with the poor quality PU coated leather, don't expect much. But if you want a comfortable water resistant boot that you wear for the occasional hike, around town for whenever it rains, or just for casual house work, this boot is quite good.Build: The shoe, in terms of build, it is alright. The leather is not soft and supple, but more of the quality you would expect from shoes around its price range (plastic coated non top grain leather). The outsole and midsole are cemented onto the body of the shoe, which does limit its longevity but it does make it waterproof when compared to if you stitched them. I am a bit worried about the outsole, which is made of a softer rubber. While this does make it grippier, this limits its longevity as well. Its soft enough where you can slightly bend/move the tread with your thumb, mostly in the parts with thinner tread. The places where you loop your shoelaces are made of metal, probably aluminum or similar. Shoelaces are alright, maybe won't last as long as you would want for a boot, but workable. There is a moderate amount of padding around the sides of your ankle and on the tongue. There is some polyester mesh like but tighter woven lining in the entire interior of the shoe to make it more comfortable. Overall pretty average.Stability:If you tie the laces tight and use all the lace loops, it has decent stability. I tried intentionally roll my ankles and it definitely helped. I'm not sure how it would handle if I was carrying something heavy though. It has a rigid heel counter to help keep your foot in. Overall decent.Comfort:Honestly a very comfortable shoe. It feels closer to wearing a light boot instead of a heavy duty boot. I liked that the insole and midsole conformed to your foot a bit and isn't too soft or too hard. If you use your thumb to push the insole and midsole from inside the shoe, it gives a little bit but then gets too hard if you try to push further. The shoe is also fairly light for a boot. Significantly heavier than a sneaker, but not up to the level of a heavy duty boot. I could imagine myself wearing the shoe often and walking in them for a while.Waterproofness:The shoe is definitely waterproof in the leather parts but the tongue I was worried more about since it mesh. The tongue is gusseted up to the first hook (or right after the 4 triangles for the laces). The gusset was designed to not pool any water and to make the water flow downward toward your toes. I wouldn't say the tongue is waterproof, but is a bit water resistant. I wore the shoe in light to moderate rain outside. I checked the weather and it was around 0.04 to 0.09 inches of rain per hour during the time I conducted the test. I made sure not to cover the shoe with anything and stuck my leg out into the rain diagonally. The shoe was basically in the rain without my upper leg or body blocking the rain. After 17 minutes or so, I finally noticed some dampness inside the shoe where the tongue connects to the shoe upper. In the upper parts of the tongue, when I squished the tongue from the outside, I noticed that the inside went from dry to damp. This means that the tongue is some water resistant mesh or soft shell  and that water will soak through with enough time in the rain. This also means the tongue is breathable. In the vid I poured maybe 2 cups of water onto the tongue (vid only showed 1 pour) and the shoe was still dry inside. I think with an umbrella, the shoe will be water resistant enough for your casual needs in continuous rain for the day. Its weakness is continuous direct water keeping the tongue saturated. I also think it will be fine if youre quickly crossing short streams or puddles once in a while and letting it dry out after before doing it again. It should be probably fine if youre going from your car to your house, to work, maybe 5 blocks, or any short journeys without an umbrellaI do not think this shoe will keep you dry if you are walking a lot without an umbrella. Or if you do have an umbrella but a significant portion of the rain is still hitting your shoes because of your height or wind and you are walking for longer distances. At that point you might as well either wear a gaitor that covers the tongue, super breathable shoes that dry quickly, a full rubber rain boot, overshoes, or waterproof socks"
"So let's get this out of the way these are hiking boots... These are not work boots... I'm about 97% sure that they are real leather... So they can make your feet smell... They are extremely comfortable. They have great traction.But ultimately once again they are not work boots.This means that the sole is simply too soft and too thin to last very long on raw concrete or asphalt... Once again it's not what they were meant for.I used mine in a mixture of tile floor and sidewalk concrete. Not surprisingly. They did not last very long before the heel wore out... Not the boots fault not Columbia's fault. They are just not work boots...Love, the gray, beautiful looking boot actually."
"Can't beat Columbia's blend of comfort, style, functionality & price. I commute via train downtown for work then have to talk a mile round-trip. These expertly handle the slick city-scapes if it's raining, snowy or icy. And yes--they are waterproof. Should keep your feet dry so long as you're not trudging through 6 inches of snow or stepping in giant puddles. They also look the part once I get into the office which in important where I work. Highly recommend!"
"I really love this brand. The boots are very comfortable and very light. The materials are really of excellent quality. I have had several colors but in black they look very pretty. I will buy this brand again even above the one from the little tree, highly recommended."
These are super lightweight and fit very well right out of the box. They are also waterproof !
"Tested these boots extensively - 3 weeks of backpacking in Vietnam. From hiking in the mountains, walking in cities, riding scooters...they're very comfortable boots. Great fit.The only complaints I have are:(1) Slippery soles when wet. That's a huge negative for me. They need to use a better compound.(2) Metal lace hooks are soft and will bend. They won't bend when you tie laces, but sometimes the boots catch on each other when you walk, or they catch on debris in the bush. I expect better hardware for the price paid.(3) Right boot now squeaks a bit. Not a big deal to me, but could be annoying for other customers who buy these boots."
Perfect
"High quality great price point. Strong support, great for mild to cold days. Love the colour."
"I bought these as a backup pair to take on a week long trip. I wound up wearing these more then my regular boots, comfortable and light weight."
