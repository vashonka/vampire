Great shorts!! Very comfortable
Nice shorts but they do run small. I’m a large and had to order a X-Large. The X-large fit me perfectly.
"Love these shorts. Length is as illustrated and the material is top notch. That said, as others have mentioned the elastic around the legs for the inside lining is a bit tight. Not so much that it is uncomfortable for a 30 minute run, but I could see needing to cut it for more extended wear."
"My son loves these shorts. Very comfortable, nice stretch, lightweight. Great for working out or just hanging out."
Love the fit and waste band - durable compared to older design shorts.
"I'm a 31 sized waist for all my pants so I got the medium.  It felt way too snug for a medium.  I could go for a large, but I don't want to bother at this point."
Good Quality running shorts. The black strip on the side is for air conditioning; but you can't see through this. I was a little worried at first!!
Belle short🤩
Comfortable
"The CRZ YOGA Men's Linerless Workout Shorts are excellent! The 7-inch length is just right, and the material is lightweight and quick-drying, making them super comfortable for any workout. The pockets are a great addition, fitting my phone securely during runs. The fit is spot-on, and the Melanite color looks sharp. Highly recommend for anyone looking for durable and stylish gym shorts!"
"If you’re debating between these CRZ Yoga’s Hybrid Workout Shorts and their higher priced Casual Thicker Shorts, here’s the real scoop from someone who lives out of a suitcase:The Hybrid Workout Shorts are your go-to for almost anything. They’re lightweight, slightly tapered at the back for a clean look, and so versatile I wear them everywhere—from the gym to the grocery store. They pack so small, you can take several pairs without sacrificing space.However, the Casual Thicker Shorts, while incredibly comfortable and slightly more polished in appearance, have a downside. They’re bulkier, making them less ideal for a tightly packed bag. Plus, I found a slight inconsistency with one pair where the pocket didn’t sit flush against the hips, which could be annoying.Bottom line: For the active traveler or anyone with limited packing space, the Hybrid Shorts are a no-brainer. They’re multifunctional and efficient. Choose the Casual Shorts if you’re not pressed for space and prioritize comfort over convenience. Always check the fit right out of the box, especially around the pockets."
"This is not a paid review. This is not a compensated review to keep a product. I am just a guy looking for quality, comfortable and good fitting workout shorts. These are legit. I do not have any from another high end brand to compare directly. I can say that if you blind fold someone and have them feel these, they will not think they are a not a major name brand for $28. These shorts are worth every penny. Fit is excellent. Comfort is superb. And quality is unmatched for the price. You really have to put these on and in your hands to understand. I know you're seeing all these cheap brands pop up and it's overwhelming. I am here to save you time. Try these. My guess is they are very comparable to a company that sells shorts for $80. I included a picture to better show the material and texture of these shorts. They are very lightweight. I am 6' 175 athletic build and medium is perfect. Don't even have to tie them."
"First impressions: good looking pair of shorts for the gym, the pool, or for loungewear. Soft & stretchy material. Comfortable with breathing room but doesn't look overly baggy. Ample room in pockets for phone or wallet. Zippable compartment and coin pocket are a plus. Hem of shorts sits about 4 inches above the knee for me."
These are great work out shorts if you wear compression shorts. They fit as advertised and actually stay up. I always wear compression shorts when I workout so they were just the ticket.
Been using these for about 2 years .  Have about 5 pairs now.  great for the price.  Durability is on par with lulu's
"My husband loves these shorts. We live in FL and he wears these like almost every day. He says they're super comfortable and look great for both at home and going out and about. Also, they have plenty of pockets. I've purchased 6 pairs in different colors for him. He has a pair of lululemons, but prefers these over those ones!"
I'm very pleased with the workout shorts - they fit very comfortably and are extremely durable.
"Seem to be decent quality light weight shorts. Fit TTS. Im 6’3, 33/34 waist and ordered M"
"I didn’t know what l was missing by wearing cotton and cotton blend shorts and getting so hot and sweaty with no A/C in my house!I am not a runner- lol- l have Hip Failure and need a new one- the fabric of these shorts is sublime! Cool, lightweight with an inner lining panty, no stretching and light as a feather! I got these on sale and hey are so high quality that I bought another pair at the higher cost because they are super worth it!!!!"
"These are very lightweight, they fit great in the waist and in my opinion they’re the perfect length. I really like the color. There is a liner so if you didn’t think about coordinating your panties and have a darker color on it’s ok you can’t see them. Idk about the rest of you ladies out there but for me, finding shorts that fit in the waist without being huge in the butt can be a thing. These are my new go to."
Love the bright color
"In general I like these shorts. They fit well, although I would say that the sizing chart might be a little off. I bought XL based on the chart but I think I might really want an L -- the XL seems just a bit too roomy, and I normally wear an L in bottoms. The fabric is fantastic, incredibly lightweight. All of that said, they have the worst shorts pocket situation possible. There is just one zippered side pocket, on the right, and it is absolutely tiny. You could pretty much fit just your ID and a car key in there. Since most of us use running shorts for a lot more than just running, this pocket situation seems kind of unforgivable. I was prepared to order more pairs of these if I liked the first pair, but I'm not going to because of the pocket situation."
"My wife loves these shorts. They are extremely comfortable, stay cool and are the perfect length. They are great for working out in and you can even use them easily over a swim suit and swim in them with ease if you are looking for a bit more coverage for a swim suit"
"I like the fit, but the inner lining is way thinner and lower quality than the past versions of these shorts. Pocket is barely big enough to hold keys and a card, getting my hands in it is difficult. Wish the pocket was bigger and that it had pockets on both sides to fit a phone - who goes out with just a key and a card? Probably won’t buy this version again."
Great fitting and bright. The color did not fade.
Highly recommend
"As a dedicated fitness enthusiast always on the lookout for stylish and functional activewear, stumbling upon BMJL Women's Running Shorts was like hitting the jackpot! These shorts are not only an incredible value but also a spot-on dupe for the beloved Lululemon styles – and dare I say, even better in some aspects!First and foremost, let's talk about comfort. The elastic high-waisted design offers a snug yet comfortable fit that stays in place during even the most intense workouts. The fabric is soft and stretchy, providing the perfect amount of support without feeling restrictive. Plus, the quick-dry feature is a game-changer for sweaty gym sessions, ensuring that I stay cool and comfortable from start to finish.But what truly sets these shorts apart is their practicality. The addition of pockets is an absolute game-changer, providing convenient storage for essentials like keys, cards, or even a phone. It's a small detail, but one that makes a world of difference during workouts or outdoor runs when I need to keep my hands free.Another thing I appreciate is the variety of colors and patterns available. Whether you prefer classic black or bold prints, there's something for everyone in BMJL's collection. Plus, the quality of the stitching and construction rivals that of much pricier brands, ensuring that these shorts hold up wash after wash without losing their shape or color.And let's not forget about the price point. Compared to the steep prices of Lululemon shorts, BMJL Women's Running Shorts are a steal, offering the same level of style, performance, and comfort at a fraction of the cost. It's a win-win for budget-conscious shoppers like myself who refuse to compromise on quality.Overall, I can't recommend BMJL Women's Running Shorts highly enough. They're comfortable, stylish, and functional – everything you could ask for in activewear. Whether you're hitting the gym, going for a run, or just lounging at home, these shorts are sure to become a staple in your wardrobe. Don't hesitate – give them a try and thank me later!"
"I got black & blue. The blue is more of a dusty blue & not as bright as I expected, but I still like them. Dare I say, I think these shorts look kind of sexy when I have them on! I ordered both pair in the 2.5 inch, high waist, size Medium. They fit great & aren’t too tight or uncomfortable in the stomach. For reference, I’m 5’7, 135 lbs. I’m not fit & I have a little bit of a tummy pooch. For those complaining about the small, backwards pocket, remember these are running shorts. They’re made for runners & nobody runs with large items in their pockets, nor do they want items bouncing around on their thighs while running. They have the panty liner attached inside but it’s not too tight or uncomfortable either. Great quality, comfortable fit, & I'm happy overall."
"Really like these shorts - they're incredibly comfortable and I really like the brown color as it has a touch of purple that is really nice. They are kind of puffy which isn't the most flattering, but the dolphin hem on the side helps with that. The one downside is the weird pocket - having a zipper pocket is super helpful, but it's sewn in reverse vs forward, so goes backwards towards the rear. Putting things in the pocket is awkward, especially since it's a bit small for a phone. Otherwise these are great!"
"I like the way the shorts fit. The waistband is super elasticated and thick for tummy control. Decent length, would have to try them out to see if they ride up too much though. I'm 5'4"" and 160 lbs, typically a size 10-12. I got the Large in Summergreen. Fits well but the color is not at all green. Its more like greyish blue. Nice color but not what I was anticipating. Probably gonna return for a different color."
These are very cute and comfy and true to size. Not tight in the thighs at all. I wear them to practice where  I run around a lot and they are great!
"I love all the color options and have tried these shorts several times in several colors, but just don't love them.I have a pear shaped body with a small waist and athletic hips and thighs.  It feels like I am in between a medium and large, but the mediums are not flattering and the larges look very baggy.  I have also noticed that after several hours of wear, the waist band starts feeling very tight and is uncomfortable.I do like that they have a zipper pocket and the built in underwear, but wish the sizing worked out a little better."
"I got these for my niece for a track meet at night, the colors didn't disappoint. They fit well and are true to size, wear well, and wash well. They dry very quickly and the material is a good quality."
"These BMJL Women's Running Shorts are my absolute favorite!What I Liked: I wear them all the time and even have them in different colors. The gray pairs perfectly with everything, making them incredibly versatile. I love the fit—they’re not too tight, and the higher waist is super flattering. They’re easy to style with a crop top, tank top, or even a sweatshirt, which adds to their versatility.These shorts have become a staple in my wardrobe due to their comfort. I've even purchased multiples in the same colors because I wear them so often!What I Disliked: Honestly, I can’t think of any downsides. They’ve been just what I was looking for!Overall, I highly recommend these shorts for anyone seeking comfort and style in their workout gear!"
"LOVE how high waisted they are, and definitely a great lulu dupe!The material is great, feels good quality and will be great for the summer!Built in underwear is also very comfy."
Very comfortable and the delivery was very quick.
Best workout shorts I owned. Has inner lining and the material is amazing! 100% recommend to get your hands on it
"Horrible quality shorts received stained and seller refusing to refund although providing photos. Very unprofessional seller , selling used items as brand new"
"Bought these as a look alike to the lululemon fast and free shorts., but much more affordable. They are a good light material. Very comfortable and have a pocket in the back. This is the second pair I have bought and will likely get more in different colors!"
Loved the style and fabric. I used them to run a half marathon and felt good the entire race. They are very conftrable for running and outdoor activities. If you are looking for some short to run a 10K or attend bootcamp this are the perfect pair. I have them in two colors and they feel great.
Super cute but fit ran small and I needed to size up. Material is super breathable and doesn’t seem cheap!
Love the fit and quality. But the yellow color is see through so you see the built in granny panty very clearly. I bet they are great in darker colors though.
"Love!!!! So soft, great material. Holds up very well in the wash and has built in liners. I find these more flattering than the lululemon shorts."
"I only really wear lululemon shorts. I love their fast and free but they never have any colors in stock and I decided why not try a “dupe”, and these are reallly similar to the lulu fast and frees. But … these are weirdly kind tight and the waist band is not thick enough so it’s a weird rise, like it’s not low rise but it’s not high rise but not mid rise either… idk. They just look unfinished and cheap. But they aren’t the worst shorts! They are pretty comfy and the vibrant color is nice. The color is just like the picture."
didn’t realize that the shorts are connected so it’s not as flowy as the lulu ones but still cute
"In ordered a medium hoping for a flowy, but snatching short. The waistband was too wide, and the shorts were not flowy at all. The material is very thin and hugs my thighs which is not ideal for working out."
"These CRZ YOGA running shorts are a new favorite! The high waist is supportive and stays in place, while the V-split design adds freedom of movement for running and workouts. The mesh liner is a great addition for comfort and breathability, and they dry super fast. Stylish and functional—perfect for the gym or outdoor runs!"
"Great shorts, i read reviews saying they’re big in the waist but they’re very true to size. I’m a 35” mid waist and large were great. I’m a size 10 normally so if you’re closer to a 12/14 i would definitely go XL."
"These are lightweight, breathable and flattering. Perfect for long runs. They fit a little on the large side, but I'd say they're generally true to size. I will be buying more!"
"These are a great pick when looking for a running short that’s affordable.I do have a few nit picky complaints.For the price I’m quite happy with these and got two colors.They’re super comfortable first of all and very flattering. I went with the medium, as that’s what I usually get for shorts because I have an athletic build with bigger thighs and a smaller waist. So the first thing is that I wish I could tighten the waist band. When I run I want a tighter waist to keep them from falling down in the front. They don’t fall off by any means but they just bunch up and require constant adjustment when running.For walking, wearing around the house or around town, the medium is a perfect fit for what I want and I don’t have an issue needing to adjust them.My second complaint is about the built in underwear. The fabric feels a little cheap and I don’t think will hold up well over time. They’re a little like granny panties but they are necessary because of the short style so theres no accidental butt cheek flashing.Overall, this IS a good pick for an affordable short and the colors cut and fit are exactly as pictured and I am happy. I expected there would possibly be some tiny things I didn’t like."
I love this brand and everything they sell is usually true to size but I think these shorts ran a little small. Still so cute and exchanging them for a different size!
"These run a little small, but they do fit me. Because of the design, when you sit down, the back portion falls back and your entire thigh is exposed. They are soft and thin."
"The color was spot on for what I was looking for. The built in brief does not dig into you at all, very comfortable. The lightweight material makes it great for lifestyle, running, yoga, and pickleball.  True to size, XS."
Obsessed with the style and how these fit. They are super light weight and high quality and look so good on. My new favorite workout shorts!
Great shorts!!
"I have been searching for a new affordable pair of running shorts for a while.  I have used UA SpeedPocket Shorts for years and they are starting  to look like it.  Outside of those my mian pair are Brooks Sherpa's due to the snug phone pocket and tons of space for my gels.  I took a chance on these when i saw the inside phone pocket that was incorporated into the right hip pocket.  From the get go, the fabric was the first impressive part.  Lightweight and moisture wicking for sure.  Exactly what you'd want in a high quality pair of shorts.  I have a usual waist of 31-32"" and the medium was snug but not tight.  I think a Large would have been too big.  I love the 5"" length, short and breathable, but not blinding cars with my pale thighs.  I wasn't sold 100% on the phone packet during my runs, as it does tend to bounce a bit more than I'd like.  Slow casual runs are fine, but when i get into speed drills or tempo runs it becomes pretty noticeable.  Never did I think it would fall out, just didn't like the constant patting against my thigh.  The waistband is very comfortable, and the internal drawstring does a great job of getting rid of any looseness left.  I enjoy the side pockets and the phone pocket a lot.  If I had 1 upgrade to it, it would be to add a small key fob pocket somewhere.  Otherwise I am confident that these will give me many miles and years of running."
"Got a medium sense that's what I usually wear in shorts, but ended up going a size up, and I am glad I did. These are an excellent pair of running shorts, have pockets, and comfy. No issues, just go a size up."
These shorts are as durable as they re comfortable.
"It specifies a 2XL for a 32-34 inch waist; however, a 2XL has a circumference of about 39 inches.Will update my review after exchanging for a smaller size."
"I’m not a “runner” but wear these to the gym. I like the light weight feel, quick dry material and overall look and feel. I’m not one for  gym “shorts” that almost touch my ankles so these 5in are perfect.(:{)"
"I been searching for this color for a long time as it is out of stock in UA store for a long time. Item as described, fits perfectly."
"I like the fit, length, and design generally. But they’re not stretchy, so they’re a bit uncomfortable as you move."
"Very good shorts. Very pleased with this purchase. Two pockets (left and right), draw string fastening, good strong waistband, and comfortable inner liner. Very good indeed."
I never usually where shorts but decided to get these for swimming. Now I where them all the time! And I love the colour!
"CRZ yoga's butterluxe collection is great! The material is buttery soft. It is thick, but not too thick. The six inch shorts stay in place well throughout a long workout on the mat or otherwise. They come in lots of great colors to choose from. I like to get a few colorful pieces and a few standard black so that I can mix and match lots of different colored tops. I work from home, so I live in these all summer and wear their leggings in the winter. They wash perfectly in the machine and come out of the dryer beautifully. They fit true to size, and they have lots of stretch to accommodate different body shapes and sizes. They have the quality of higher priced brands."
Omg these are so freaking soft!! Immediately after I put them on I did not want to ever take them off! They are the perfect length and size. Fit perfectly and the pockets did their job! Not see through at all. Quality was wonderful. And I’d say very flattering. Just buy them!!
"The media could not be loaded.
                



EDIT TO ADD: I now own two full sets and it’s the first thing I gravitate towards. I absolutely love the color options and these shorts never ride up! The quality is great! Absolutely love the sage gray!I love everything about these shorts and brand. It is extremely affordable. I watched a review video on your tube that called this brand a Skims dupe. I’ve never owned a skims product but I honestly feel like what’s the point when I have these instead. I have never felt better when I wear anything from this company. The shorts are the 4th product that I own now.I will say, the warehouse shipped the matching top instead of the shorts. But it was a quick return and I got the shorts quickly. There are no pockets. But I’m willing to over look that. They are comfortable and fit well on my body type. 10/10 highly recommend. I will be buying ALL the colors."
"I am very picky when it comes to spandex/leggings and the way they fit and feel. I usually end up returning most because the quality and/or fit just isn’t right. These spandex are super high quality and buttery soft! I have another pair of leggings by this brand and when I saw these spandex, I knew I had to try them. When I buy a new pair of spandex, I’m always nervous about them being see through and/or riding up. Neither of these things are an issue! They feel amazing on, are very flattering, and they are perfect for working out or just everyday wear. Another huge bonus is you don’t constantly have to yank them up, they stay in place. I plan on getting more colors! Highly recommend!"
"Literally love these shorts!! They feel buttery soft, thicker but comfortable material, not see through,  and they don’t ride up! I got a size small and they were the perfect length for working out, running errands, etc. You honestly can’t beat the price point too! My only complaint is that the color appears darker in the photo. Once they arrived, they were a lighter chocolate brown, which is fine i guess. I will be repurchasing more of these shorts in the future!"
I absolutely love these shorts. They are so comfortable while providing decent support. The material is thick enough you don’t have to worry about skin showing but not too thick that you’re overheating while wearing them. The length was perfect for wearing with oversized hoodies or t-shirts. The quality is amazing for the price and after endless washes they still look just as good. I was even able to wear them throughout my first and second trimester comfortably.
