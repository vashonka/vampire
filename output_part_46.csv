"I got this for my daughter as a starter kit into the world of make up. It came with everything is shows all unopened and in great condition. The makeup was good quality and worked well on her. The bag it comes with is super cute and convenient to keep it all together. I'm giving 4 stars only because the little stencils were iffy, someone with experience might have an easier time with those."
It‚Äôs amazing kid and it comes on time and they give you a cute box box design when they deliver it to you !!ü©µü©µü©µ
Granddaughter loved the makeup.
"I will state up front that I make my own skin moisturizer out of hyaluronic acid and sweet almond oil....................................................................................*****.....................................................................................I bought ""Set 2"" four weeks ago.  This set of makeup and makeup bag are just as pretty as they look online.  The quality of the various actual cosmetic items and colors is outstanding.  I'm amazed and extraordinarily pleased with the colors, textures, and long lasting stability.I'm 68 now.  I put my Set 2 makeup on.  A friend saw me and told me I am beautiful and look so much younger -- about 30 years younger.I don't know about the other sets, but Set 2 is composed of items from three cosmetic lines:  Lameila, AOLIKOKO, and Miss Rose.Set 2 is pure reliable enjoyment!!!So many years have passed and a great amount of money wasted on mascara alone.  All the mascaras that were guaranteed to not smudge or flake did so anyway, including during the first three hours of wear.Not so with Set 2 mascara.  I wore and slept in the mascara for nearly 24 hours before there was tiny, tiny flaking which easily cleaned up with a moistened cotton hanky, leaving the mascara looking fresh again.The shape of the mascara brush is perfect.  I'm able to coat all of my long blonde eyelashes.  I enjoy the way the brush separates my lashes as the mascara coats them.  My lashes looked natural instead of fake.  Love the eyeshadow, too.Oh, wow!!!  All of the pallet & tube lipsticks and lip glosses stay where you put them.  My personal favorites are all pallet lipsticks.  In the set of brushes, there is a lipstick brush.  That's what I use to apply the pallet lipstick onto my lips.Enjoy!!!"
Great shades and nice and compact design.
Quality was best and I gave it as a gift. The receiver loved it.
"She told me it was a great gift to get ,She needed more make up She said she will buy this when she runs outs"
I really like that
Got for my granddaughter for Xmas!!! She loved it
My five year old daughter loved this makeup kit!  It was adorable and you get a lot for the price. Will purchase again!
My niece LOVED this! Definitely her FAVORITE gift! Goes everywhere she goes! It's so adorable and the accessories were definitely age appropriate!
Everything seems to be good quality from what I have examined The unicorn is adorable and everything comes nicely wrapped inside of the unicorn makeup bag. This would be a great gift for a young kid that likes makeup and unicorns.
Bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Enjoys the items inside the bag. The bag is cute but not that big.
I panicked after I ordered thinking I made mistake getting it because of the clean up or staining but it came off super easy. Even off walls√∞≈∏¬•¬≤
This is perfect for a little girl that wants to play dress up. Much better quality than I expected for the price. A great value and gift
This arrived just as advertised. Great quality bag with lots of make up. Our three year old granddaughter is going to love it!
My four year old daughter loves the makeup and the purse is durable. The brushes are soft and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s overall cute.
Perfect size for my toddler. She thought it was cute and the bag was so soft.
"I bought this for my granddaughter! She absolutely loves putting all the different makeup varieties on and is so happy when she looks all made up !! Wonderful gift for young girls! It‚Äôs safe for children‚Äôs skin, washes off easily! Scent less!! Great price ! The sparkley purse is absolutely beautiful and just the right size !! It‚Äôs a 5 star for me !!"
Bought for a friends 6yo daughter and she loved it
"The inclusion of a Unicorn-themed bag is a delightful touch, adding an element of fun and creativity to the overall experience.  I just wish the bag was a little bigger. The variety of makeup items provided, along with their washable and non-toxic attributes, makes this kit an attractive option for introducing young ones to the world of makeup in a safe and enjoyable manner.The washable feature is particularly praiseworthy, as it allows kids to experiment and play without the worry of permanent stains or irritations. The vibrant colors and unicorn theme are sure to capture the imagination of little ones, fostering creativity and imaginative play.The only negative was the brushes were very flimsy, but an easy switch out."
This is great for my 6-year-old. The lipstick is all a lip gloss so it's not a  crazy color on them . It's cheap enough so when they destroy it the first time playing with it you don't get up set. fun little set
Got this for a b day gift for our niece and she LOVED it! Super cute and really works!
My only complaint is that the powder foundation should have come in different skin tones. My brown skin daughter likes to play in kids makeup sets as well. However this only came in a beige complexion. Too late to return as it was for her birthday and she still wants to keep it.
Very cute. My 4 year old niece loved it.
Bought it for my 3 years old niece and she love it. She loves the unicorn purse more than the make up. The make up is very kids friendly
Bought for my 5 year and she absolutely loves it!  Does everyone makeup when get come over now and loves to put on a little for special occasions to be fancy!  Would buy again
Bought this as a gift for a 5 year old girl and she loved it!
I love this item it works very well everything can perfectly not damaged I rate it a 10 out of 10 and I think it was a pretty good price
This makeup kit is well worth the money. Perfect for teenage girls.
Nice beginner kit for girls wanting to experiment with makeup without spending a lot of money.
"This was a Christmas gift for my god daughter and I thought it would be perfect for her since she is just getting into make up. The set appears to be of good quality but the makeup bag came straight out of the package damaged. I‚Äôm very upset about that. I would have sent it back but considering it‚Äôs already a late Christmas gift, I didn‚Äôt want it to be any later. However, the contents inside the bag appears to be in tact."
"This kit contains a lot of useable makeup for a reasonable price. Most of the colors included will work with different skin tones. However, some shades and items would not compliment darker skin tones."
Got this as a gift for a 15-year-old GrandGirl. She and her cousin went nuts over. It. Includes A lot of different small products.
We absolutely love these!!! I bought 2 when they were on sale and we both love them!!!
Perfect gift for Christmas
"I would be happy to gift this to a person just getting into makeup.  It has almost everything you need to do a full face.  The only odd thing about the set is there is an overuse of the word ""concealer"".  For example, the foundation was labeled correctly on the glass bottle but the box said concealer.  It also had that verbiage on the cream blush, bronzer and highlighters which are all in one set.  There are two eyeshadow palates which I was very happy to see as that is one of my favorite cosmetic products.  They are both neutral and good for anybody.  I liked the mascara as it stayed in place all day.  I was pleased it came off nicely and did not settle into my fine lines.  The lipgloss is more like a liquid lipstick.  The resulting color is drying and darker than the tube.  I feel that was the only product in the kit that I would change.  Overall this is a well put together kit."
This is a great starter kit.
"This makeup set is perfect for beginners or anyone looking for a variety of options. It includes a wide range of shades for concealer and eyeshadow, so you can experiment and find what works best for you. The set also comes with essential brushes and sponges, all neatly packed in a cute box. As you explore and test the colors, you'll likely enjoy discovering new looks.However, if you're an adult seeking a quality makeup set that you‚Äôd want to use regularly, you might want to consider other options. I‚Äôd suggest checking the contents of this set and then heading to your local drug store. While this set provides a wide range of shades, you may find it challenging to find a perfect match for your skin tone, which could result in partially used products that you may never use again. For instance, the liquid foundation didn't suit my skin color, and two of the concealer shades were either too light or too dark. They have weird crayon-like scents that made me feel unpleasant. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for‚Äîthis set might lack the high quality, waterproof features, and skin-moisturizing formulas found in other makeup products available."
"First off, this kit comes in its own decorated box which makes it great for gifting! This kit is perfect for someone just starting out and practicing. It is a complete kit and will have everything you need for the face. The palettes are gorgeous and have plenty of usable options. The makeup itself is average, applies nicely, no clumping or smudging and dries pretty quickly without cracking. I was able to wear it all day with no issues. The lip gloss was the only thing than wore off fairy quickly, but not a big deal. This kit would be great for someone just getting into makeup, easy applicators and plenty of makeup to practice with. In fact, I gave it to my daughter and her friend to try and they love it and got gorgeous results. None of us have had any negative reactions to it either. Definitely something you could gift to someone!"
"This makeup set would be great for a pre-teen that is just getting into make-up to explore different options.  I would say by the time they are a teen, they already know what they want to use.  The foundations were a little hit/miss.  I don't think my daughter used any of them.  It did come with a variety of brushes and foams that she did like.  Overall, I wasn't super impressed with this for my early teenage daughter, I think it would be more suited for a pre-teen."
One of the products leaked over the other things.
"I got this set for my daughter and she loves it, it‚Äôs a great starter set for any teen. It includes 2 eyeshadow palettes, one with nude tones another with pink hues, a cream contour and concealer palette, foundation, 2 concealers, 3 liquid lipsticks, brushes, mascara, gel liner, brow products and 2 beauty blenders. My one qualm with this set is that the foundation is the lightest shade of ivory and therefore, doesn‚Äôt suit most skin tones. I wish there was an option to choose the foundation shade you need, because just getting a random one is a waste, unless you actually have that skin tone.I do have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the makeup, especially the two eyeshadow palettes, The shades were pigmented and didn‚Äôt leave much fallout. I also liked that they offered both matte and metallic/shimmer shades.Overall, this is a great starter set, especially if your teen or tween is wanting to experiment with colors and products."
"So yeah, I'm definitely not an expert on makeup and my wife wouldn't touch this stuff because she already has her own fancy stuff that she almost certainly overpaid for.  She doesn't trust putting a brand of makeup she doesn't recognize on her face where it could possibly go in her eyes or mouth and frankly, I don't blame her for being cautious.For the sake of testing it out, I went ahead and applied some of it to myself just to get a feel for it and it seemed really nice to me.  The colors are quite beautiful and they apply nicely with the included brushes.  There are a couple of tubes of concealer and a couple of foam ""egg"" applicators.  There's an eyebrow pencil, mascara, eye shadow, blush, you name it.  My 6 year old daughter was really begging to have it, but she's too young, so this will probably end up being donated or given away as a gift.All that being said, if you're young and just getting started with makeup, this would be a fantastic way to get started, as it includes almost anything you might want.  As your tastes mature and your wallet fattens, you can start getting more selective and adding more of the expensive brand name stuff to your collection."
My granddaughter is just starting to wear make-up.  This was a great beginner set for her. Plenty of color options. Has everything she needed.
"I bought this product for my granddaughter, but the products inside was so good. I kept a large part of them myself."
"It comes with everything you need to create a new look. I rarely wear makeup but had to for  some business meetings. All my makeup was old so I got this. I have not used every item, but have used most.The lipsticks are highly pigmented. The contour stick doesn‚Äôt do much - it doesn‚Äôt seem to want to apply to the skin. If you rub back and forth you will get some color, but it‚Äôs not strong or dark. This could be good for a beginner wanting to learn how to use it, but for people who do a lot of contouring, they‚Äôll find it subpar.The eyeshadow palettes have a good blend of colors and do have shimmer shadows included. They are not highly pigmented. You can build up the color some but not much. The eyebrow pencil works well for people who like a subtle look. For those that use a guide to draw on thicker eyebrows, this product is too subtle to do that, but works nicely for a natural look."
Great for a teenager!
"I really liked it but it was open, as I lived in another country I did not consider neccesary to do the whole process to have a new one and it could be not them fault, anyways, I like it."
I was thinking black friday it's hit or miss but this is a gift you give if you want them to feel like a makeup pro it is amazing I was floored!
Product was good  and really help look great and good cosmetics
With this kit I learn how to do my makeup. Really easy and this kit is complete
Product is as expected.  Good price.  Put together nicely.  Great way for young girls to practice applying makeup.  Great mixture of product in a very cute case.
This was much smaller than what I anticipated but it has a lot in it for such a little case. This will be a Christmas gift so I will come back and let you know how my niece liked it but I think it is adorable.
Purchased this for my goddaughter and she loves it. Makeup comes off easily. Definitely has everything a little girl would want would buy again
