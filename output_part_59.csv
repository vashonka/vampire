"Got it for the birthday gift of my son, he loves it. Still holding great."
This game was a very big hit during the graduation party. Everybody loved it. It was super great. It‚Äôs adorable and it was well worth the money.
Package came with missing instructions and missing parts. I can only use it for axe throwing. Items are all made of plastic and very cheap. The whole item is very flimsy. Not worth the price at all.
I bought this to take camping but have enjoyed it at family gatherings. My 10 year old grandson loves it. I like that it can be used with both darts and axes. It is made of lightweight materials so it‚Äôs easy to take anywhere.
Easy to put together and get down to having fun. Stands up to moving and playing with the kids.
The kids loved this well made product
Everyone enjoyed this over the summer - young and old :-)
Good game for outside this summer well made.
"This is a really fun game, but the frame  is made of plastic and I don't expect it to last long.  Who  knows, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised!"
"This was purchased as a gag gift for when my husband can‚Äôt make it to the range. It had my husband and son playing for hours. It is light weight and maybe a little flimsy, but still sturdy enough to be used for hours. Fun for the whole family."
"I bought this to keep me and my 9yo busy for the rest of the summer. Ordered last night arrived early this AM. He has been playing with it all day. Assembly was easy and it works as it was described to. ONE THING TO NOTE: If you watch the product video, the motor has a little pin like object to attach the rotating hands. Mine did not have one.It rotates like is should though. I'm not sure if that was a design update? Just something to note, so if your doesn't have it, know it still works! PVC is sturdy enough, could it be sturdier, yes. But it does the job."
"This game is really fun, just poorly constructed. Be sure to do a trial assembly a day or two before you plan to use the game in case you need to run to the hardware store. The game was sent with the wrong parts so we had to purchase a pipe joiner separately in order to complete assembly. On top of that the toy guns both broke within the first hour of the day, but by holding the top of the slide could still be used more or less. While the game lasted, it was a big hit, it‚Äôs just poorly made and not very durable."
Grandson has had lots of fun. His other grandfather does target shooting and has even played with him. Does take up some room
"This is really fun, but the plastic used for the base is thin and brittle. It we get three days out of it, I will be amazed. I was able to order additional balls."
Hours of fun for all ages.  Easy to put together.
This item was missing the main part to hold it all together and another part.I am very disappointed with this product. It was purchased for a Fall festival and could not be used at all.
"My grandson loves his gift. He opened and played with it right away! It‚Äôs easy to assemble, has a good weight, and his ability to perform the different speeds are great. It‚Äôs good for his age group. I‚Äôd recommend getting, the quality has meet my standards."
"I ordered it for gifting to 5 year old, but learned the kid has it already and enjoy a lot playing with it."
it was an amazing gift but the part was canceled
It was good idea for a birthday giftGood product. Children had a lot of fun
"This is a great idea. You get what you pay for, it's priced low and the material is definitely cheap. Not durable. It's fun for the kids while it lasts."
"My Mom and I put it together while sitting on the couch lol but can totally been done solo in 5min.The adults took over before the boys got a hold of it üò©ü§£ü§£.Simple, yet Super fun and lightweight; easy to configure and load the guns."
A very significant purchase and very highly regarded / appreciated! experienced seller A++++
"This was a great gift for grandma‚Äôs house for the younger grands kids!!!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èThere are 3 young boys who absolutely love playing with this shooting game. They have more fun shooting at each other than the targets, but boys will be boys and with the balls being foam, Grandma doesn‚Äôt  have to worry about injuries with these toys. Setting up the target was a breeze and they were quickly into competition to who could get more targets. The use and operation of the pump action gun is easy enough for the even the 3 yo to operate. I give this a five star rating because of the value for the money compared to what is currently on the local market and durability of the toys. It has been about a month and they are still holding up well under the constant use of kids.  Super fun & definitely recommended!!!!üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
"Fun, easy to put together and nice and sturdy"
"Love this item, definitely one of my favorite summer games. Great fun for the yard.  Value for money. Seller sent quickly and packaging was good."
I purchased this for my son‚Äôs 8th birthday. We had a pool party and the kids really enjoyed playing with it. Only downside is that they couldn‚Äôt figure out how the release the rings from the bottom. Once they were shown we had no more problems.
This was definitely worth it easy to put together my son did it alone and they just love it. Definitely a good buy.
"Who could say anything negative about a jumbo connect four? This is used in our wine tasting room and have yet to have a complaint. Took less than 10 minutes to put it together and it is used inside and outside through wind, sun, and sat outside for a couple of rain storms. I appreciate the hooks on the toy itself that stores the rings making clean up and storing a breeze!"
Great product for the price. Ability to adjust the height was a plus.
Bought this for a backyard gathering and it provided fun play for adults and kids alike. It's sturdy and height adjustable.
"Good Quality, HUGE in person, good part of new collection would like to see more retro decks or variety in Huge Decks!"
Love the cards but it is really hard to shuffle the cars as they are big lol but very easy to use we play family game night every week now
"The huge size is a fun twist to this traditional card game.  The size is definitely harder to handle, which is what makes it so fun.  Very young kids may find it more frustrating than amusing though.I first purchased these cards for the kids at my church to play with before service starts.  It was one of the most popular things we had out.  I‚Äôve since picked up a few sets as gifts.  Everyone has liked them so much, that I finally bought one for our household."
"Obviously hard to shuffle,  but good quality cards, and fun with lots of people."
These cards are so big and fun. I love these cards
"I bought this for a senior care center. They are huge cards and the box is a little heavy, but I think they will enjoy this game since almost anyone is going to be able to see the cards easily."
I love the size I have the very mini small ones and had to have these also. we play uno alot  and these ones have become very popular  in the house . Durability  is great . Thicker then expected.  Color is bright and clear . These were absolutely perfect the price is affordable.  Not gna lie hard to shuffle but still makes it fun . They won't disappoint!
"These were the life of the party on my friends beach trip! We had such an awesome time in the summer using these! I think they could be used for all ages, and the quality of the cards are no different than the smaller cards I believe. This is Fun for family and friends and everything in between! It is bulky so I will say if you‚Äôre traveling, make sure you have a bag that‚Äôs perfect for it! My one small comment is that I do wish they made these giant Uno cards waterproof for those of us that want to use it at the beach."
"Huge cards, great quality"
This is hilarious! I was expecting jumbo playing cards but I wasn't expecting them to be the jumboest of jumbos. Holding the deck is like holding a book and just as heavy! We laughed so much. You should have seen us double-teaming on shuffling as we each held one half of the deck and tried to time getting them to fall into each other. Make sure you have a big table to play on cause they are gigantic. Actual Dinosaurs could play with these. Made my day. I love it!
"This was a great purchase! The price lines up with the quality. We played ping pong all winter, here in Wisconsin to keep the blues away.The table was very easy to install and doesn‚Äôt leave marks when you move it. It folds away but we‚Äôve left it up to use as a table. It doesn‚Äôt look cheap, so it works as a full time piece of furniture.***Be aware, this is not a full sized ping pong table and it says so in the description. It can be a challenge to adjust to the smaller size, but I like the challenge. We can now play pretty competitively in our basement and didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice the space required for a full sized table."
"There is everything to love about this table. It was small enough to fit perfectly in our loft, but big enough to be fun to play on; it is sturdy but sets up as easily as a folding table; and it is lightweight so you can transport it, if you want, or tuck it into a closet or under a bed. This is one of my favorite purchases because of the high fun to money ratio. I can have a ton of fun as often as I want for very little money."
"Opened the box and was playing several minutes later. Great quality product, from the table to the paddles. I was looking for something I didn't have to put together and this was ideal, and it's not terribly heavy either. There was a small dent on the metal side, but not noticeable enough to be annoyed about. I also didn't mind that it's 6 feet vs competitive tables, because it's nice to be closer to hear and to see (for those of us with crappy vision without glasses) I was able to do all the aggressive moves I do on larger tables. A+ product, we are having so much fun, and sweating from the exercise!"
"Delivered in 2 days ... yessss!  I've missed Amazon's 2-day prime shipping since March. Thank you seller and courier!  Purchased this table for quick recreation so not expecting much.  It's small enough to fit in an apartment. That's a deciding factor for me. But it only comes in red, that's a big minus. It can be an eyesore if it doesn't match the room.  And I think red's too bright a color for the eyes to keep track of the little ping pong ball. It comes with a net, a pair of rackets and 4 ping pong balls.  I got rid of the rackets and balls, they don't feel right. The table is made of thin plywood.  It absorbs a bit of the ball's bounce so it it takes more effort on the players.  Quite noisy too.  I'm considering installing foam underneath for noise reduction.  The frame and legs are made of aluminum that would bend and dent easily so be careful setting up or storing. There are little dimples on the sides of the table that I have received.  Must be from shipping and handling.  It's poorly packaged.  It's only in a thin bubble wrap with small foams at each corner enclosed in a not-so-snug box. Imagine it being tossed in the facilities and into trucks then to you.  That's the first thing I checked, dents. But the folding bars and legs are ok, just little dents on the frame that will not affect the table's use.  I'm not disappointed with it but I cannot say I am pleased.  The important thing for me is to be able to move my family away from our dining table and into this new ping pong table instead. They seem to like it and I am able to reclaim my dining table so I'm liking it too. I think it's expensive so good thing that it's offered to be paid in installment interest free.  That was another deciding factor for me."
"Bought for my son‚Äôs birthday. Was a little worried about other reviews talking about damage during shipping, but our came in great condition.Quick and easy set up. Sturdy and a nice midsize table for smaller spaces. We really like how portable it is to move from various locations. Very happy with the purchase!"
Easy to assemble. Sturdy and very east to fold and out away.  Great inexpensive option if you are looking to have some fun.  Only recommendation. Balls are a bit heavy so the bounce is a bit off.  Purchased some colored balls and they are lighter and seem to connect with the paddles and table better.  Overall highly recommend. Exactly as advertised.
"We just used this table for the first time. It is super easy to set up, and it is small enough that we could set it up on the patio. The grandkids loved it, and thankfully let me have a turn. It might be a little small to try to play 2 vs 2 without whacking into each other, but for 2 people it's perfect. Table arrived in good shape and is quite portable. Super fun!"
"Our whole family - three generations - are having a blast playing on it. It is sturdy and well-made, yet portable and easy to set up, take down and store. The materials are high quality and pleasing to the eye and touch. I like how the corners are smooth and padded. The paddles, balls and net that come with the set make it a complete package with everything you need to start playing. It‚Äôs a great value and I‚Äôm certain our family and friends will enjoy it for many years to come."
"Was very pleased with quality of this table, no issues out of the box and easy to set up. Surprisingly sturdy for the price, and the included paddles and balls were good enough quality for us that I didn't bother buying  anything else. If you're used to playing on a full sized table, it takes some getting used to ‚Äì¬†also when the ball hits the metal frame edges it does tend to bounce wildly and unpredictably. When it works in your favour though it's good for a laugh. Because we have a smaller rec room area to put this in, it was a better fit for us, so coupled with the lower price those minor issues were an easy trade off. Folds up nicely with a handle on the case to bring it with you if the need arises. Highly recommend for those with a bit less room or who might be on a budget."
No assembly needed. Very easy and portable. Adjustable legs. Awesome fun and the kids love it.
Bought these for our daughter‚Äö√Ñ√¥s birthday party since we have a big backyard to keep the kids occupied. Everyone loved em. Great way to unwind and relax after long day without having to think. Would buy again. And the felt hasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t disappoint. The balls still stick!
"I bought this package for a family vacation - enough for four people to play! Also, the velcro material on the balls wears out over time, so the extra balls in the box were great for swapping out."
This is an easy activity to pull out. We bring it camping and enjoy it. This is our second set.
"Super fun, but balls break way too easily. Will need extra balls"
"My kids love playing with these. What‚Äö√Ñ√¥s great is that my 3 year old can also partake and feel included. I went with the four pack in case they have friends over etc. Velcro is great and you have plenty of balls in case one or two get lost. Love the sack it comes with to keep all of it together. The size is perfect for little to big hands, so the age range is easily 3 and up. Super durable and extremely easy to use."
All my grandkids love playing this from 4 years to 13 years
A ball lasts maybe 3 hours if play. They start to fall apart after that. You better buy the 4 pack
A good game to play with your kids to teach them how to catch without the frustration! Also they can play with it by themselves too!
"Super fun to play with. The velcro/ball attachment is quite strong, sometimes it's a little hard to rip it off the board, but I see that as a good thing."
The plastic plate on both catchers cracked during first use. Wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even throwing the ball hard.
"Purchased for the grandchildren, some who were too young to catch a ball with a mitt.  Everyone liked them"
Simple but great purchase
Purchased for grandchildren..ages 5&7 yrs.Kids enjoyed playing. Age appropriate.

I got this for the backyard for summer, but it has also been a GREAT indoor toy as well! My 19 month old has started to want to throw toys, so when she does we just re-direct her to this toy. It's wonderful because it has the sticky target on one side and bean bag toss on the other, so I can switch it up when she gets tired of one.The velcro on the balls holds great, they will even stick if they bounce off of a hard floor, and depending on the fabric can stick to her clothes which she finds hilarious. I also appreciate the bright colors of the balls so you can easily find them.The bean bags are the perfect size and weight for little hands. You just lay the triangle on its side and it turns into a ramp for bean bag toss.The quality has been great and has held up against my toddler. It is very lightweight and easy to pack, and comes with stakes to hold it down outside. I only wish it came with a drawstring bag to store the balls and bean bags. Overall, a great indoor/outdoor toy and would make a great gift."
"Bought for a 3 yr old...but entertaining for others as well. Used indoors on a Rainey day. Velco balls really do stick nicely to bullseye and bean bags are small and durable. Colors bright., Really happy with purchase"
"Cute game for little ones to play at anytime, and can be used indoors and outdoors. The balls stick great and easily to the target number side and they and stay once stuck on! The bean bags are a perfect size for little hands. It is easy to fold up flat and put away (I have not coiled it back up they way it came). My girls have a great time playing with it, keeps them busy for a nice amount of time. My once dislike is that the velcro that keeps it in its playing position is a bit flimsy and I can see it not lasting very long."
My daughter and her cousins love to play with this at our cabin when it‚Äôs too cold to swim. We‚Äôve also used it at birthday parties. It‚Äôs super cute.
"Easy to assemble and fun to use for toddlers. Even they can put it together, with a little guidance.Enjoy with littles, and even big kids like it!"
This game is very interactive but very flimsy. Works better inside than outside. The velcro balls are small and easy for kids to put in their mouths. Not recommended for teething toddlers.
