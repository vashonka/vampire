These are great economical lights. I use them for senior and hone portrait sessions and they move and fold up nice. Great lights for the money.
"I’m truly amazed at how much comes in this setup. This kit comes with a full lighting system and multiple backdrops, and even has a travel bag that every thing fits in perfectly (just remember how it was originally packed and you’ll be golden). I was elated that the kit is all inclusive, so everything from clamps to lightbulbs were included and I didn’t have to run out and get anything to complete set up. The portability of this product and ease with which I can assemble and disassemble everything is unbeatable. No additional tools are needed and on top of that I’m 5’7” and can easily extend the backdrop to its full height without needing any assistance or a stepping stool. I completely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a photography setup that they can take anywhere and everywhere. Do yourself a favor and get this kit!"
Overall this is a good light set.  The stands for the lights are a little weak and you need to be careful with the cords pulling them over.  The package also was missing one of the light diffusing screens.  I e-mailed the vendor but haven't heard from them yet.  I'd be happy and would add more stars of they could just mail me one.
"This is a great starter kit for anyone needing lights for photography or video.  The stand is lightweight, but sturdy and is best suited for indoor work (though I used it on an outdoor shoot and it worked just fine and was stable).  The stand expands to full height at approx 6’ and has a diffuser to soften."
We are avid game players and this is one of my top favorites! We have played with our family and new extended family. Everyone loves this game! It is easy and fun and helps break the ice with new people.
"Summary:  Herd Mentality is a game for 4+ players, ages 10+, from Big Potato Games.(Please see the enclosed pictures.)I highly recommend this game for any group game setting.Each round, a player draws a question, asks the crowd, and everyone (including the reader) writes down an answer.  Then, tally up the number of players with the same answer. The players who wrote the most common answer each get a point.The first player to eight points wins. If there is a tie for that round getting to eight points, the winning total goes to nine points and so on until there is a clear winner.One additional rule is important, if you give an answer that is the least popular then you win the ""pink cow."" You cannot get rid of the pink cow until someone else wins it. You cannot win the game until you get rid of the pink cow.Here are some examples, if four people are playing, and the question is ""what is the best flavor of ice cream?"" then you could have the following situations:Players A & B say vanilla, and players C & D say chocolate. There are no clear winners and no one gets the pink cow.Players A & B say vanilla, player C says chocolate, and player D says strawberry.Players A & B get one point each.Players A, B & C say vanilla, and player D says chocolate. Players A, B & C get one point, and player D gets the pink cow.On to the Dr Games‚Äô Criteria ‚Ä¶GO/NO GO Criterion‚Ä¢ Complexity: (GO)  This is a relatively easy game.‚Ä¢ Balanced: (GO)  The game is completely balanced.‚Ä¢ Chance: (GO)  There is an element of chance in which cards you are drawn and read.‚Ä¢ Clarity: (GO)  The rules are completely clear.‚Ä¢ Reasonable Time: (GO)  It generally takes 10-20 minutes.Bonus Criteria‚Ä¢ Social:  The game is very social, fun, and you learn a lot about the other players.‚Ä¢ Unique/Interesting Mechanics:  The awarding of the pink cow makes the game much more interesting.‚Ä¢ Informed:  You potentially learn a lot about the other players.‚Ä¢ Rewards Throughout:  Yes, once you get a point, it is yours forever."
We saw this game while on vacation last summer.  I checked Amazon and found it and the expansion pack.  What a hoot to play with a crowd!  This is fun for all ages and I purchased two sets.  I am keeping one on hand here for when everyone is over and the other is for a family that LOVES to play games.  This brings many laughs.  The excitement when we get this out is contagious. I am looking forward to Christmas when everyone is home this year to play as a large group!  Fun game.  You won't be sorry you bought this for groups of people to play.  The ages of those who have played it are 8+ to 68.  Fun was had by all.
Good game but not for a family of 4.  I‚Äôm thinking 6 people would make the game enjoyable. Cute game pieces. Can be played with a wide age range with general knowledge.
Easy to play and lots of fun great for all ages
"This game is great!  Always laughing and fun discussions at each person's turn.  I don't think I will ever get tired of playing.  It's fun to ""moo"" when someone is taking a long time to answer.  Glad I bought this game."
"Simple to learn and fun. Unlike Blank Slate, where the goal is matching your answer to just one other person‚Äôs answer, earning points in Herd Mentality is done by providing the most common answer. So your answers aren't necessarily your true opinion regarding the question; they are what you think everyone else will answer. For example, a question is ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to make eggs?‚Äù I like hard boiled eggs the best but wrote scrambled because I didn‚Äôt think anyone would even think about hard boiled (and I was right!). Anyone whose answer is in the majority gets a point, and the game ends when someone reaches 8 points, so it‚Äôs a quick little game. If only one person answers outside the majority, they get the pink cow. Play continues and points can still be collected when you have the pink cow, but you can‚Äôt win the game if the pink cow is in your possession. The only way to get rid of the pink cow is if another sole player answers outside of the majority. If more than one player gets to 8 points at the same time, play continues until one player has the most points."
We play a lot of games and this one is definitely a really fun one to play!! I would recommend this game! The extra bonus cards help keep the fun going. Best part is looking at people.
Cute game and easy to play. Great for younger kids since the rules are simple and can be quicker if needed.
"Such a great game to play with multiple people! Shines with a group of 6+, perfect for all ages!"
"We have grown to enjoy a few rounds of this game after dinner, right at the dinner table. Simple to set up, simple to play, easy to store. Lots of fun."
"I love playing this with my 5 y/o son. It’s easy enough, but also challenging for all ages. The magnets are very powerful and satisfying to play with. Good quality."
Extremely strong magnets make this game so fun! Comes with a small bag for storage. I like that it can be a quick game or an ice breaker.  I always crack up as magnets decide to move and click together very quickly.  Fun game for all ages!
"I had seen these advertised so I bought one.  It's a fun, simple game that both old and young can play.  Simple yet still challenging"
I have played this with three year olds to 70 year olds.  Great fun!  Easy play easy to store and easy to take with you (just remember this has STRONG magnets in it so be careful where you set it!  ). Even teenagers like it. No batteries no moving parts. Perfect gift
Fun game for all ages.  The magnet strength is great and it’s easy to play.  Maybe too easy though.  Even our grandkids figured out early on how and where to place the magnets so they didn’t stick together.  Maybe having more magnetic stones would make it more challenging.
Really like this game. It’s quick and fun. Plus different every time since the string can be set down any which way.
My grandkids 6-19 loved it & even adults joined in.  Fun!
Perfect game for young people or us older people ! Good family time together!  Value was awesome! Love the family time we can share !
My kiddo loves this game! He just stared to read and spell and he finds this game fun
We are a family that is always looking for a new game to introduce to the youngest generation. Family game night is always filled with fun!!
"This game is great for kids who want to learn new words and improve their spelling. It's like playing Scrabble, but designed specifically for children. It helps them build their vocabulary while having fun. They can practice spelling different words and learn how to use them in sentences. Overall, it's an excellent tool for young learners to develop their language skills in an enjoyable way."
"Fun—even for adults, but most exciting is that my son is learning to read in a fun way! Cannot recommend enough!"
"I am giving this game as a gift and haven't done so yet so I can't say if they will like it, but it seems to be of good quality."
This is a great gift for younger kids. I would say it’s too easy for my 8 and 10 year old now.  However when they were younger it was a great intro to scrabble for them.
Christmas gift so I won't know more until then if my grandson liked it or not
Purchased fir gufts forgrandchildren. Great to help with spelling.
Good that the game can be used from a young age and grow to a more advanced level with the child.
"I have a 3 and a 7 year old... it's a dual sided game, so the first side is easy enough for my 3 year old to use. You basically just have to place letters on a board with letter spots already, so there's not a lot of thinking or planning.Flip over the board and it's more of a traditional scrabble, and my 7 year old loves it!It's a great learning tool too, especially when stuck at home with covid. Beats watching tv, ipad, movies, video games, etc.Price is right, shipping is fast, highly recommended!!"
"This board game is not of the same quality when my grandma bought the game to play with us (in the 60s-70s!) but it isn't flimsy.  Grandma played her game with all us children for over 20 years, I'd guess, with the same deck of cards.  I don't think these cards will last that long so I'm already planning to find out if I can get a replacement deck.  However, SORRY! is a terrific game and easy for children to learn to play by themselves.  I played 3-4 games with the grandchildren, teaching them the rules, and I found them playing the game by themselves when I was busy one afternoon.  It's a fun game, easy for kids to ""get"" and the cards play no favorites!  My kids are 7 and 8 but I think ones as young as six could play the game well."
"Sorry! offers the perfect blend of simplicity and strategic depth, making it an ideal choice for our family game nights. The rules are easy to grasp, ensuring that both my younger and older kids can actively participate and enjoy the fun.Apologies in Motion:Witnessing the joy on my kids' faces as they strategically played the coveted ""Sorry!"" card to send each other's pawns back to the start added an extra layer of excitement to the game. The playful rivalry and unexpected twists kept us all entertained.Family-Friendly Fun:What sets Sorry! apart is its ability to cater to a diverse age range. My two kids, with their varying interests and ages, found common ground in the thrill of racing to the finish line and hindering each other strategically. It has become a game that strengthens our family bond.Quality Components:Hasbro's commitment to quality is evident in the durable and visually appealing components of Sorry! The vibrant board, sturdy cards, and well-crafted pawns not only enhance the gaming experience but also withstand the enthusiasm of my energetic duo.Endless Replay Value:Despite its simplicity, Sorry! continues to offer endless replay value in our household. The unpredictable nature of the game and the element of chance ensure that every round brings new surprises and keeps my two kids eagerly asking for more.In conclusion, Sorry! has become a cherished classic in our family game nights, weaving together the joy of apologies, laughter, and the thrill of sweet victory. It's more than just a game; it's a shared experience that has become a treasured part of our family story. If you're looking for a timeless and engaging game to enjoy with your kids, Sorry! is a must-have for those memorable moments filled with fun and connection."
"Good family fun and a more colorful, simplified version of Parcheesi. We still play for a quick game with laughs. So I’m passing the game on as a donation that helps kids have fun with colors, counting, rule following and sportsmanship. Game boards folding into quarters makes this easy to store."
Exactly as described. Age appropriate. Fun for the whole family. Crush proof box. Great price value for the money.
"Sorry it is a good educational game even starting at two years of age because they need to learn to count there is a little bit of popping with noise but it’s enjoyable with a child.. It’s very durable lightweight, and the speed of the dice being pushed is what you would expect."
This is a fun game for the entire family.
"As someone who is a sucker for board games, this is and has always been my all time favorite game! Unfortunately, I lost my original copy of this game, so I was forced to buy another copy from Amazon and it came as expected - in brand new condition! Every piece, card and game board was there and untouched. If you're into ruthless, action packed, back and forth games - then this is the game for you! The max players is four, but it can be enjoyed with two players. This game never gets old!"
"I recently introduced the Hasbro Gaming Sorry! Game to my grandkids.  The rules are simple enough for the little ones to grasp, yet there’s still plenty of strategy involved, which keeps it exciting for the adults too. We love the thrill of sending each other back to start—there are always plenty of laughs and friendly competition!"
"When my niece is come over, they like to play this, so I got it for them for Christmas"
Fantastic.  Bought it for my great grandson age 5.  My boys used to play it and their dad before them.  It was grandma's favourite game.  I used to always look out for second hand because for some reason I couldn't buy it new.  I bought second hand for both my boys.  then for my granddaughter when she was 5. So now we all have the game.  What fun and I have recommended it to others.
"Purchase on March 10, 2020Just before lockdown and really our family and friends played it throughout the lockdown without even getting bored for a moment at that we played atleast 10-12 turns daily"
"This game is easy to carry, easy to play - and very fun.Great for family trips and friends!!"
"So fun! My 5 yo great niece and 6 yo Granddaughter loved playing this at Thanksgiving! Brought lots of laughs, especially when the force of the magnets take over..lol Thinking about buying some for Christmas gifts! Easy to set up and super easy to play!"
"I saw an ad for this on social media and it looked interesting.  I found it in Amazon for less than half the price offered on social media.  Anyone of any age can play and win this game.  The pieces are highly polished and pleasant to the touch.  It is impossible to tell by appearance or shape which magnets are stronger than others so it is truly a game of chance.  A game can be very quick and entertaining with 2 or more players.  I would buy these as stocking stuffers, Hanukkah or Easter basket gifts.  The magnets and the string are easy to transport and could lend themselves easily to a child friendly game or a social drinking game and much in between!"
"I originally saw this on Instagram and  checked if Amazon had the item.  I always compare to see if price is better.  Which it was, plus I trust Amazon delivery alot more than anything on Instagram.  Anyhow,  it's  an easy game, anyone can play it and it would be great to take along on vacation or any type of trip"
Strong magnets make it a super fun game. Great price and comes with draw string bag making it very portable.
Bought this for my grandson to take on a trip so we’d have something to play during downtime. Great little game. Simple pieces and satisfying sounds when the magnets connect!
This game is really fun! The magnetic strength is just enough and fun for kids or adults needing to pass some time! Quality is great!
"All ages enjoy this game. It’s quick. Challenging, fun and brings laughter."
"Perfect toy for a family get together. Easy to play and understand,  bright colors."
When we go outside and go to the park we use this a lot and we're trying to play catch and learn how to throw that's why I like this it was totally worth the money.
These are small and very cheaply made.  I would not purchase them again.  Velcro comes off and the plastic ring/rim does not stay on.  The ring/rim looks to clip on around the perimeter of the paddles.
Does the job! Not super durable but works for what we needed it for. Can’t beat the price.
"These items literally fell apart during use! The balls started coming apart at the seams when my kids would pull it off the Velcro, then the Velcro completely pulled off of all the “mitts”!For $15 I am completely disappointed and would never buy these again!"
My grandchildren loved them safe and great for their small hands
Cheap product
Product received in timely fashion and true to description.
Great set to help teach little ones to throw and catch. My toddler granddaughter loves it and we've had hours of fun. Well made and durable.
"Good quality, can be used by younger children"
The paddles are flimsy and fall apart quite quickly. Luckily you get a lot in the package so the fun will last a while. Would recommend for a bit of beach/garden fun but just treat them with respect
Great set for a fun game with a group of people. However the set didn't come with a bag which was a bit of a shame. I already had one here and was grateful it wasn't a gift. Brilliant game for hours of fun.
The paddles broke after first use with the velcro ripping off when the tennis was removed.
"Excellent game and quality. As a teacher, I love how this promotes turn taking, patience, hand eye coordination, and stacking."
"Thanksgiving games…great product p,  well made, sturdy and a ton of fun for the grown up children. Lol easy take along game."
"Love it, very durable and fun to play"
"Genga is a fantastic game! It's easy to learn, fun, and full of excitement. The fast-paced gameplay keeps me coming back for more. Perfect for all ages and great for playing with friends or family. Highly recommend!"
"I had no idea that this game would make me laugh so much!  It's pure fun!  I would caution about playing with people who are high-strung as the tension can get pretty high as the pile gets wobblier.  At 72, I'm glad I got this game.  Livens things up!"
