LOVE these shorts! I have 5+ pairs that I rotate through weekly as a full time yoga instructor. These shorts are the perfect length -both stylish & functional. The perfect Lulu shoes at a fraction of the cost. Love how soft the fabric is yet it provides shape and structure to form fit the body; hugs the body with the perfect amount of stretch ones without being too tight and do not roll down! Shorts stay in place throughout an entire yoga class! They come in a wide varieties of color - love them all and haven‚Äôt had any issues being see through. Save your money on higher end brands and buy these shorts!!!
"I‚Äôm serious. The fit is perfect, true to size, holds you in without being too compressive. I have worn them countless times and the quality of the fabric has held up after many, many washes. Legitimately comfortable enough to sleep in and also to wear when working out and going for runs (!). Like how is that even possible? Sorcery, probably.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10, relatively athletic, with a butt and thighs, the 6‚Äù inseam is exactly what I wanted. I already have two pairs and will be buying more."
I loved it so much that i got another color after trying it out!
"I've been using the Champion Athletic Shorts for several months now, primarily for my morning elliptical workouts, and they have quickly become my go-to shorts. The fit is true to size, and I love how they are loose-fitting without feeling baggy. The lightweight fabric is incredibly comfortable and breathable, which is perfect for my intense cardio sessions. Plus, the Double Dry technology really works wonders, keeping me dry and comfortable throughout my workouts.One of my favorite features is the side pockets, which are perfect for holding my keys and other essentials. The elastic drawcord waistband allows for a custom fit.  Despite numerous washes, these shorts show little signs of wear, which speaks to their durability. The iconic C logo patch at the hem is a nice touch, adding a bit of style. Overall, I highly recommend these shorts for anyone looking for comfort, functionality, and durability in their workout gear."
"These were a super sale at $11. They fit perfect without feeling constricted at the waist like other elastic banded shorts. I ordered 3xlt and they go to just above my knees. They are both very cool and comfortable as the material is on the thinner side. They also hang nicely without looking baggy.  The pockets are adequate. Not really deep but they hold essentials. As a 6' 6"" 300lb guy, its hard to find clothes/shorts that not only fit but are wearable, look good,  and are comfortable. These are by far the best shorts I've come across."
"Comfortable, fits well, doesn‚Äôt absorb moisture easily. Good for workouts and pickleball"
These shorts are comfortable and soft. They have a nice slightly above the knee fit and look great.
"These aren‚Äôt favorite shorts. They didn‚Äôt shrink much after being washed so the size is very accurate. The pockets are great and hold all of my things. They look very nice, and are not see through at all. They aren‚Äôt thick, which means the temperature is almost always nice. The durability is pretty good as i‚Äôve washed them several times and they have not been ripped."
Size is as expected. Good material.
I paid $11.99 and wear these to the gym every day. Best shorts ever. Lightweight  for sure.üèà
"I just picked up a L maroon short on Prime Day. There are a few things I like and one major dislike so far.Pros: I like the color on these shorts. The fabric is lightweight and comfortable. The pockets are deep and they hold a variety of items (keys wallets phone etc) without any issue. The waist isn‚Äôt constricting and I can use the drawstring if I want a tighter fit.Cons: as you can tell on the photo, I‚Äôm noticing small deficiencies throughout the shorts. I‚Äôve only worn them around the house after washing them. There should be no reason why these small tears are popping up. If it was just one or two, I‚Äôd only knock it down a star but there are enough for me to notice.I doubt I would order another of these shorts because of the condition of these shorts. It‚Äôs too bad because I do like them more than dislike them."
"These are comfortable shorts. The material is really good. The price is maybe too high for what you‚Äôre getting. I‚Äôm wondering if I could probably get something similar at one of those big box stores that sell clothing! I‚Äôm keeping them, but I don‚Äôt love them the colour of the green isn‚Äôt a true khaki. It‚Äôs more of like a warm khaki. So I‚Äôll probably just wear them around the house or when I‚Äôm playing tennis."
"Fit nice, helps stay cool during hot summer basketball games"
"These shorts are comfortable. They‚Äôre honestly great for the price. They‚Äôre flexible and stretchy. I will say, after only 4-5 washes, there are loose threads, but I expected this, as they were cheap. Also, they may be a bit sheer, so I advise a base layer or compression shorts underneath."
"The Real Essentials 5 Pack of Men's Dry-Fit Sweat Resistant Athletic Performance Shorts has quickly become a staple in my workout wardrobe. These shorts offer everything I need for an active lifestyle‚Äîcomfort, durability, and a great fit.First off, the dry-fit material is a game changer. Whether I'm hitting the gym, going for a run, or just lounging around, these shorts keep me cool and dry. The sweat-resistant fabric really works, wicking away moisture so I don‚Äôt have to deal with that sticky, uncomfortable feeling during intense workouts.Each pair in the pack is lightweight and breathable, making them perfect for a variety of activities. I also appreciate the elastic waistband, which has just the right amount of give without feeling too loose or too tight. The drawstring is a nice touch, allowing for easy adjustments to get that perfect fit.One of the best things about this 5-pack is the value. It‚Äôs hard to find such high-quality shorts at this price point, and getting five pairs means I always have a fresh pair ready to go, no matter how busy my week gets. The variety of colors is great, too‚Äîthey‚Äôre stylish enough to wear outside of the gym, which is a bonus.In short, these shorts tick all the boxes for anyone looking for comfortable, high-performing athletic wear. Whether you're a serious athlete or just someone who likes to stay active, the Real Essentials 5 Pack is a fantastic choice. They're well-made, versatile, and offer unbeatable value.

"I have two sets of these shorts, one I purchased in august of 2020 and one in august 2021. Clearly I went back to buy another set a year later so I must like them, and I do. They are priced INCREDIBLY well. At the time of the first purchase, I had just started playing sports again and needed lightweight shorts to cut and move in. These are DEFINITELY those shorts. They breath very well, they're comfortable enough that now I not only work out in them, I lounge around the house in them and go to sleep in them as well. They've held up pretty well to washing. I wash them on hot with powdered detergent and oxiclean powder and rinse them twice and then dry them on medium heat. They've probably gone through at least 100 washes thus far and I'm still wearing them. Yes, some of the seams have loose thread, yes some of them start to come off over time but they're $6 a short and none of them have unraveled to the point that there are any holes or they are unwearable, it's just something you would see when you look at the inner part of the waistband.The ONE weakness of these shorts is the pockets. I've had several that have started developing holes in the side seams of the pockets. Now it only started happening a year+ later and they've been beat up and washed many times so that's not quite so bad, but still it'll happen. I suspect this is more to do with how big and heavy phones are nowadays since it's always on my right pocket (where my phone goes) and started pretty much after I upgraded from an iphone 7 to an iphone 13 pro. But two years and 100+ aggressive washings later, only 3 out of 10 shorts have pocket holes and only one has a hole big enough that I'm scared to put my phone in the pocket.These are fantastic shorts and they could easily charge double. I plan to replace some of the original ones with a new set even now."

These shorts have quickly become my go-to choice for workouts and daily activities.First and foremost, the comfort level of these shorts is unparalleled.

I love having the convenience of pockets to hold my essentials, such as my phone and keys, during my gym sessions. It eliminates the need for carrying a separate bag, streamlining my workouts and making them more enjoyable.The 5-pack option is fantastic value for money. I now have a variety of colors to choose from, and each pair is equally comfortable and well-made.

"Very comfortable, my son love to wear them for football training don't feel hot of sweat in them"
"Sizing is normal and as described, super comfortable to run or hike in, very breathable. I like how they show some leg on the side but are long enough in the back to stay covered with no cheek hanging out. Waistband makes you look snatched. 10/10!"
I ran 20 miles in these to test them out and fell in love. They don‚Äôt hike up or rub and feel great! Only regret is that I didn‚Äôt buy more. They look great and feel awesome. I wore them in a marathon two weeks ago and will now use them till they are falling apart
"I saw some reviews saying run small, so I purchased in two sizes to be safe. I feel my normal size fit perfectly, so I would say true to size. Very comfy, I like the pink color and the pocket for storing my car keys. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was I feel once I start walking or jogging they start riding up. At one point it almost looked like I did not even have on shorts because they wrote up higher than a T-shirt. I‚Äôm still planning to keep them though"
I needed some shorts to go white water rafting and these were amazing. Quick dry and no bunching. Very comfortable.
"My daughter loves to work out and wear expensive work out clothes.  Specifically from Lululemon.  But when she realized she can get less expensive but good quality work out clothes from Amazon, she is saving her money.  We bought her this pair in black for Christmas.  She loves the way that they fit and that they are not transparent, even when she is bending over.  They aren't too short and they don't ride up.  She lives with us and she has washed them at least 10 times and the color hasn't changed, the seams are in tact and the material remains the same.  This is a great way to save money and use it wisely.  These shorts are definitely a win purchase and an item we are purchasing again."
"These are fine. They ran small for me - going to size up.  I bought a Medium; I wear an eight mostly for my booty, but these were pretty small all around."
These are true to size and don‚Äôt roll over like some high waisted shorts. The pockets are deep enough to hold my phone without it constantly slipping out. I would definitely purchase again
I've ordered like 5 pairs.  They are SUPER comfortable and so enjoyable to wear.  I have them in multiple colors and the black is definitely a staple.  Works great with cropped shirts too.
"Like the headline says, this is my 3rd time ordering these. I really like the way they fit me and they are good for everything from lounging, traveling, working out, and running. The zip pockets work well and hold my larger phone and keys. The zips are good to keep everything is place and make sure they wont fall out during activities. The material is soft and from my use, durable. I have swam in them on a whim during a hike and they dried fairly quickly without any fuss. Inseam is fairly accurate and fit me well."
"They quality feels good so far, they fit nice, pockets are deep enough for your phone to comfortable slip into, thickness feels similar to what even Nike would use and they are very lightweight! I'm 6'1"" 237lbs and I bought an XL. Definitely buying again."
"So the grey shirts are darker in person. The clothing dries fast. Not too thick but not very thin. The pockets are wonderful. They are breathable and the fit is good, I would say they are worth the money."
"The only thing I don‚Äôt like about these is the draw string is very long, it actually hangs out the bottom of the shorts. I had to tie it in a knot to make it shorter."
"I bought a 2 pack for yoga (black/blue). The fit very well for yoga. The 5‚Äù short has some stretch to it, making them perfect for exercise. But, they look great for casual wear as well. I bought another 2 pack dark/light grey. Definitely buy again."
"When compared to the average pair of Nike or Adidas shorts, this 2-pair deal is very tempting. Especially since it comes in many stylish colors, has lots of hidden pockets, and is made with that coveted 5 inch inseam. But after a measly three months of use in the gym, these shorts started to tear apart at the seams (literally). From the back butt seam and the side seams, these shorts were rendered unwearable within a few weeks. So while these are a good deal, I won't be buying them again...and again...and again; I'd rather invest in a higher quality brand that lasts many months and years."
Bought for my son. They fit and wash well. True to size. Very nice quality. Will definitely buy again.
"I found the first set of these on TikTok shop, but it took too long to ship and so I switched to Amazon to purchase. These are great quality and they are inspired by the other brand that shall remain nameless. My two year-old son wears a pair every day."
"The shorts are light weight and stretchy. The inner layer compression shorts stay snug but not too tight.My iPhone kept falling out of the left pocket when I worked out on machine at the gym, so I added a stitch to the pocket opening and now it holds my iPhone with no problem.The right rear zipper pocket is too small to hold a wallet."
Love these shorts. Good quality with relatively good compression. Maybe not as tight as I would like but that‚Äôs my fault. Regardless they are comfortable and I will be buying more for my running journey.
"If you are looking for affordable workout shorts this is the one.I use them for running, gym, and soccer. And this shorts does it's job.Good thing about this is the inner liner make you comfortable since you don't need to wear underwear, so it feels aligned with the pants. Also, the phone pocket keeps your phone in place. But it is not super tight pocket, so it may slip out if you do a lot of jumping.The outside material are like basketball jersey like texture so stretchy and breathable. Back pocket has zippers to keep keys and small items safe, but the side pocket are shallow and doesn't keep the items inside. (That's why I deducted 1 star).But overall it is a great workout shorts, and if you are looking for one that you want an easy wear to the gym or a quick jog, you should give this a try.Thanks for reading my review and hope it helps with your shopping!"
"Purchase for my son who plays sports. Uses them for practice. Came in plastic bag. Fabric is stretchy , thin, lightweight, and comfortable for movement. He loves the side pocket for his phone or earbuds. Not transparent at all with 2 layers, came in several colors and he has about 3 of them."
"These fit great and are super comfortable, BUT the pockets are so super small. The only deep enough pocket is on the tights side, BUT that just fits my phone.I love walking around my neighborhood and the other pockets are not big enough for my wallet or my keys. And the zipper pocket in the back is only big enough for chapstick. Weird.  I think zipper pockets in front would be nice so that at least I felt confident that nothing would slide out. These are kinda a bummer."
These are amazing. They make me look forward to gym! Haha so stylish and comfortable
"These are just as good as the running shorts that go for $60/$80. They‚Äôre stretchy, soft, good spandex length plus has two regular pockets, towel pocket, back zipper pocket for like a key and then the thigh spandex pockets. They looks great too."
"I like these shorts and have purchased other styles but with different patterns and colors. The material breaths well and does not get hot. The only downfall is the outer shorts material can easily snag, that's why I only use them in or for the gym."
Smart of ya  to read reviews. Before purchasing. If you are a medium you must buy LARGE - they didn‚Äôt show the maxi pad at the back pocket in any pics  - why wasn‚Äôt that fluorescent instead?! Short quality is ‚Äòmeh‚Äô but passable.
"The quality of the material is ok. The drawstring is useful. However, the base Lycra liner is somewhat loose. It doesn‚Äôt fit snuggly so when I run with my phone in the liner pocket, the phone moves way too much around. I own another pair in the same size ordered from a different place and that one fits fine."
"I bought these for my partner in the summer time before this cold weather started kicking in, and he still wears them around the house this fall day. They‚Äôre breathable, lightweight, and not tight. They seem durable, no holes or zipper malfunctions. Id definitely recommend them and I‚Äôm sure he would too lol"
"I‚Äôve been wearing under $20 shorts to the gym the last 3 years. For a few extra dollars, the comfort is well worth it. Very light weight and feel well made. Hopefully they last awhile. Highly recommend for running or working out at the gym. Great colors too."
"Love how lightweight and comfortable these shorts are!!  The elastic waist band is a little tighter than I would like for the size, which is why I am giving 4 stars.  If you are between sizes, I would recommend sizing up.  The pockets are deep and have a zipper closure, which is really nice if your doing an activity and need to keep something in your pocket.  The fabric is breathable and is a nice light gray color.  They can be worn for just about any purpose, but are most ideal for physical activity or sports.  If they get wet or sweaty, they do dry fairly quick since the fabric is thin."
"I bought 2 shorts for my grandson and he‚Äôs tall and big!  I found that the quality of this shorts were amazingly tough!  He said it was comfortable and cool!  So I bought 2 more shorts and he is super happy with the shorts!I would recommend the shorts for anyone looking üëÄ for quality and awesome workmanship material, it‚Äôs durable!‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüòâ"
"Comfortable, quick day and stylish, a great fit and greater buy"
"Nice color, but feels like it‚Äôs cut right around the waist. I have similar shorts, and they fit perfect.The pockets have zippers. Very nice feature. Very breathable fabric.This brand seems like the waist was cut a bit too small. If not for that, I‚Äôd rate them 4 or 5 stars."
The shorts are so comfortable and stretchy! I recently started working out at a gym and the quality and fit is greatI actually went to buy another pair after enjoying this so muchHighly recommended
This review covers the 5 or 6 colors of these i've ordered.All fit well. I really like the zippers on the pockets. Has a back zipper for a phone on most of the models i've ordered.I wear these as a cargo short alternative. I was so happy with my first (orangish) order that i bought several colors.Highly recommended.
"I recently purchased the Adidas Defender 4 Medium Duffel Bag, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations. As an avid gym-goer and frequent traveler, finding the right bag to suit my active lifestyle has always been a challenge. However, this duffel bag ticks all the boxes and has become my go-to companion for all my adventures.First and foremost, the quality of this bag is exceptional. The materials used are durable and built to withstand the rigors of daily use. From the reinforced base to the sturdy zippers, every aspect of the bag exudes durability and reliability. I have put this bag through its paces, and it has held up remarkably well, showing no signs of wear or tear.The size of the bag is perfect for my needs. The medium-sized option provides ample space to fit all my essentials without feeling bulky or cumbersome. Whether I'm packing my gym clothes, shoes, and accessories, or using it as an overnight bag for short trips, there's always enough room to accommodate everything I need. The main compartment is spacious and easy to access, allowing for hassle-free packing and unpacking.One feature that sets this duffel bag apart is the thoughtful organization. The multiple zippered pockets and interior mesh compartments make it a breeze to keep my belongings neatly organized and easily accessible. I no longer have to dig through a cluttered bag to find what I need. The side pocket is particularly convenient for stashing smaller items like keys, wallet, or phone, ensuring they're within reach whenever I need them.Comfort is another key factor that impressed me about this bag. The adjustable shoulder strap is padded and offers excellent support, making it comfortable to carry even when the bag is fully loaded. The top handles are also well-designed, providing a secure and comfortable grip. Whether I choose to carry it over my shoulder or in hand, I always feel confident and at ease.I can't overlook the stylish design of the Adidas Defender 4 Medium Duffel Bag. The sleek and sporty aesthetic is right up my alley. The iconic Adidas logo adds a touch of authenticity and sets it apart from other duffel bags on the market. I appreciate that it effortlessly combines functionality with a fashionable look, allowing me to transition seamlessly from the gym to other casual settings.Lastly, I must mention the excellent value for money this bag offers. Considering its outstanding quality, durability, and versatility, the price point is more than reasonable. I feel like I've made a smart investment that will serve me well for years to come.In conclusion, the Adidas Defender 4 Medium Duffel Bag has become an integral part of my active lifestyle. Its durability, ample storage space, thoughtful organization, and comfortable design make it a winner in my book. Whether I'm hitting the gym, traveling, or simply running errands, this bag has proven to be the perfect companion. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable, stylish, and functional duffel bag."
"This bag will hold clothes for a weekend or serve as my catch all carry on bag for flights. The material is sturdy, repels water and has a section to hold shoes, dirty laundry or damp clothes. The bag is larger than I expected but what I needed.Great bag and a value for the money."
"I bought this bag for short trips when lugging around a suitcase didn't make sense. The medium size is definitely spacious enough for a few days on the road. The material is sturdy and it is fashionable. The only complaint that I have is that the zipper pulls ""jangle"" quite a bit and are noisy. This is a minor detail; however, I bought rubber zipper pull covers and now it is a non-issue."
"I love the size, and the color of this bag. It is definitely nice looking and good quality. I bought it for my soon to be 14y/o son to have for boxing to hold his gloves, towel, extra clothes, boxing shoes, mouth guard, water bottles, and an extra pair of sneakers or slides. As he grows it is roomy enough that he will be able to hold more inside like head gear, and more equipment. He also uses this bag for weekend trips, and could use it for an even longer vacation as it could fit multiple clothing items, self care items, and a couple pairs of shoes. Easy to clean, functional, lightweight, and comfortable to wear."
"I really like this duffel bag. It seems sturdy and durable with plenty of space. It also seems somewhat rain resistant, which is a bonus for sure if you are using it as a referee bag like I am. That being said, the side pouch zippers need to be a double zipper type instead of the single zipper in the current design. Having to open the side pouch from the bottom of the bag (where the zipper ends in a closed state), facilitates spilling out items from pouch when opening it. The main compartment is fitted with a double zipper, and side pouches should be as well."
Love the colour (brown) and functionality. Sturdy yet lightweight. Separate shoe section is a bonus. Good for overnighters/carry on.
"This bag is perfect for adult sized skates, hockey helmet and a pair of gloves with lots of space to spare. The bag seems well made. I hope the zippers hold up. I don't currently use the shoulder strap but I have it tucked into a pocket in case the need arises."
I bought this to use for road trips but ended up using it for everyday use. I really like it.
"Review for Small Gym Bag for Women, Travel Duffle Bag Carry On Weekender Bag with Shoe CompartmentI recently purchased this small gym bag, and it has quickly become my go-to for the gym and short trips! The design is sleek and stylish, perfect for everyday use without being bulky. The dedicated shoe compartment is a game-changer, keeping my shoes separate from my clothes and making it super convenient to pack and stay organized.The bag is surprisingly spacious for a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫small‚Äö√Ñ√π size, with plenty of room for gym essentials like a change of clothes, water bottle, and even some toiletries. There are also multiple pockets inside and out, which is great for keeping smaller items like keys and phone accessible and secure.As a weekender or carry-on bag, it works really well ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ I was able to pack everything I needed for a two-day trip. The material seems durable, with sturdy zippers that glide smoothly. It also has both a shoulder strap and handles, so it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s comfortable to carry in different ways.Overall, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m very happy with this purchase! It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s functional, versatile, and stylish, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a small, practical gym or travel bag."
"Great bag, it's small but fits everything I need. I really love the color, extra pockets and I was surprised by the quality. I thought it was going to be thin material but it's sturdy and thick and better than I expected. I usually go to the gym ready to workout so in my bag I bring a towel, pj's to change into, lock, hair brush and a plastic bag to put my dirty clothes. I carry my shower caddy and water bottle separate. I still have more room to add more items if I needed but I usually don't care more than that."
This is a decent size bag and fits all of my gym essentials. Can easily fit in the lockers at my gym. The only fault is that I wish it had a sturdier bottom so that it would hold its shape a little bit more.
The bag was very pretty but it was very cheap. The zippers don't work very well but I will keep it. I guess you get what you pay for.
"Very roomy with lots of pockets, but not too big or bulky to carry. Seems very well made and sturdy. However I ordered the ""purplish red"" color, which looks burgundy on the picture, but it is very much purple. Not a problem as I love purple and it is still very stylish!"
"While this bag is pretty, It is not sturdy or durable enough for every day gym use. I have used it for about a month and a half and within the first 3 weeks the shoe compartment tore and is unusable now. The seams near the zipper are also coming undone. I do not overload my gym bag either, so not sure why it would not be durable. I do appreciate the small wash bag that comes with it, I use it to hold my travel size shampoo/conditioner."
"Color is cute, very good size for a carry on. Almost got more in this bag than I did in my luggage. Lots of pockets, very sturdy, holds alot of wight. If you think you don't need a separate waterproof compartment for shoes trust me, you do."
"Unfortunately the inside ripped after 2 uses. The quality just isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t there. The wash bag is nice and well made, but the bag itself was a bit disappointing."
"Much nicer than I thought it would be. Ideal size (got a small), materials are rugged, seams are sturdy, zippers are smooth, waterproof zip compartment is large, zip compartment for shoes is handy. Higher overall quality than I expected for the price."
"The build of this bag, the shoe compartment, wet items pocket, and internal pockets for wallet / keys/ etc are all anyone will ever need for the gym. The strap is padded nicely (I carry weight plates to the gym) to feel good on your shoulders. The price is exceptional. So glad I didn‚Äôt spend the excess for Nike / Adidas / UA. You‚Äôre literally paying $20 extra dollars for the name. I got the small bag to carry my gym clothes, sneakers (size 10-men), two 5 ib-weight plates, headphones, a towel, flip flops and deodorant and had plenty of room. Small fits in my gyms lockers perfectly."
