"Not so easy to fold, also wish it came with carrying case. For the price, a very good value."
Easy to assemble
Very fun! But very hard to land all the tricks! Overall great and fun!
Just getting started in the pop darts realm. Watch the youtube videos on how to throw. Getting better everyday. Fun with friends. You Definity need a hard surface that is solid. The darts stick strong and can pick up a board or similar light weight item when retrieving.
"Super simple, super fun game. Keeps teen boys entertained for hours."
"It literally has been a game changer at the office lol, super fun"
It’s fun to play and a good gift. I like how it stores together in one bag. Easy to travel with.
"I have back problems so when my family plays things like cornhole or does axe throwing etc. I can't really participate. I came across Popdarts and loved the idea. Kinda like a save indoor lawndarts. I decided to buy a set so there would be a game I could play too and I'm very glad I did. You can play the game on many surfaces and from a sitting or standing position. The ""darts"" are light and I can't imagine them damaging anything so using them on, say, your car hood should be no problem. The darts are light without feeling cheap.If I had one downside I'd say the price tag is a little heafty but I would still absolutely recommend this item. Fun game, give it a try."
love them
"Once you learn how to throw these things it’s a very fun game and worth buying.  If you are worried about how good the suction will be, DONT.  These things STICK and are very flexible."
"I first stumbled upon PopDarts at a friend‚Äôs house after a few drinks. It started as a casual game but quickly became as competitive as the Hunger Games (minus the deadly weapons, of course). You don‚Äôt need to be a pro to play‚Äîtrust me, my technique was questionable at best‚Äîbut somehow, I was landing bullseyes like a dart-throwing ninja.The beauty of this game? It‚Äôs so portable! You can stuff it in your bag for your next trip and unleash the suction cup fury anywhere with a flat surface. Hotel rooms? Check. Airbnb living rooms? Yep. Poolside in the summer? Absolutely. Just watch out‚Äîyour kids will hijack it for hours, and you‚Äôll only get it back if you bribe them.Now, the price. Yes, they are a bit on the expensive side for what essentially amounts to glorified sticky darts. But hey, these things are practically indestructible, and once you‚Äôve made the investment, you‚Äôll be PopDarting your way through every family gathering, vacation, and dull moment. Highly recommended for all ages (and all levels of competitiveness)."
"We bought this because it looked like a lot of fun for a family, which it is!  But now our son uses it in his classroom, as well!  It is entertaining for teenagers, and keeps them interested!  We used a giant white board as the target!"
"I recently purchased the Popdarts Pro Pack game set and I have to say, it's been a blast! The set comes with everything you need to get started, darts, and instructions. The darts are perfectly balanced for accurate throws.One of the things I love about this game is how easy it is to set up and play. You can get started within minutes and it's great fun for all ages. The darts stick really well and the scoring system is clear and easy to understand.The game is compact and easy to store, so it's perfect for taking with you on the go or setting up in a smaller space.Overall, I would highly recommend the Popdarts Pro Pack game set to anyone who is looking for a fun and easy-to-play game that provides hours of entertainment. It's well-made, versatile, and a great value for the price. Five stars all the way!"
"I bought these for a few parties, people love them. They durable, easy to wash, easy to use and easy to stick. The orange target had the occasional round where it would un-stick itself but we would stick it back down and life was good. would definitely recommend for kids and adults alike."
Quality
Love these darts. Played them at a resort and had to get them amazon had them the set I ordered is jest the board had to ordered the darts separately but we'll worth it it's also a great gift to give.
"I was a little skeptical about the pricing.  It seemed like a lot for some rubber.  The darts are well made.  They stick well when thrown correctly.  I think the price is worth the fun.It can take a little bit of practice to learn the technique so that the dart lands suction side down, but it doesn't take too long to get.  I believe the pop dart people have a video on their site discussing throwing techniques.The game itself is good fun.  Playing on a glass table top is the best.  I think this will play well for at least anyone 12 and up, perhaps younger if they have decent motor control.I would recommend the double sided ""pro"" target.  The extra excitement when someone actually lands one on it is worth it.  It also means that no one is ever really ""out"" of a game, they can always come back fast."
We play this on our kitchen island in the evening with a few beverages near... A non thinking game that can be played with all ages and gets you up off the chair and moving around.  Lots of fun and laughs - we have played many times and the darts remain with suction power.
Highly recommend this game. It was a hit since we bought it just before Christmas. It is a quick and easy game to be able to take to others houses. It takes a little while to get the hang of throwing the darts. But it makes for a fun round with the other play. Our toddler also loves the game and finds it very entertaining.
"This instantly became a great hit at our game party nights. Super simple to set up, if not a little annoying at first because it can be tough to get the throwing motion correct to land consistent shots. Once you're used to it, it becomes a wonderfully competitive game."
"This product can kill hours, its great fun"
this is my second purchase of pop darts because we loved the first purchase so much.  switched up the colors with this one though so we can have more teams if we want. we played this forever in the kitchen and couldn‚Äôt wait to play again. you can play almost any where !! use a window ! use a patio door ! buy the platform thing that they also sell !  so many options whether inside or outside and once you throw a few and they stick to things you‚Äôll just wanna keep on throwing them.  their site shows techniques for throws.  just check out pop darts.  do it.
What's not to love about exercising - EVERYTHING!  But these beautifully made exercise bands make working a routine so flawless and fun.  They are of high quality and I love the bright colors to easily identify their different strengths.  I highly recommended this product.  Easy ordering and delivery too!
"these bands are well built, work well and were not overpriced."
"Bands seem reasonable with durable straps. Grips could be a little bit better quality and design. Other than the grips being under whelming, but good for the price, the bands stretch as they should."
"Great way to stay fit while traveling abroad. Easy to change weight, good grip, durable resistance"
"So, I chose the set that altogether gets you about 250 lbs. of resistance because I can't afford a good rowing machine. Come to find out that the 250 lbs. of resistance with this set is still easy to row with but provides enough satisfaction that you are getting a tremendous workout. I love it! I don't have an actual tool to test the accuracy of each cord, but if they are all accurate... then I found a splendid way to row for less!Of course, there are other exercises to use these with so there's that as well! I will definitely consider the 300 lbs. version at a later time because hey, I work with many patients at my hospital job so the more weight I can lift/push/pull the better.Overall, I say go for it!"
I purchase these bands when I was going for therapy for my shoulder and I still use them to this day. It’s a great recovery workout and I highly recommend getting these for the value quality and durability of the item is well worth it.
"Easy to use, change bands, use with door."
This set up is good. Clearly marked to see whats what. It's working just fine for my physical therapy exercises. If I had to add anything to this set it would be a second pair of handles .
Just what I needed and more. Everything is included and works extremely well for workouts at home.
It is literally not worth the price 99 dhs? The quality is very bad and  it is not same in description I received generic tools and the handles are not good they seem to cut off in first usage. Do not buy it . I request for refund
"I am very happy with these resistance bands! I purchased these in addition to another set I already had, allowing me to have different setups prepared around the room, saving time on changing bands for different exercises.For me, these bands work better than going to the gym, which comes with an expensive monthly fee, travel time and costs, lack of natural light, loud and annoying music, and often having to queue to use the equipment.I leave them on the floor in my room so they are easy to pick up. This allows me to take half-hour pauses between reps, something not achievable at the gym. If you're at home or work from home, you can do some reps every hour during the day.In terms of results, I've noticed improved muscle definition in about 3-4 weeks. I'm sure the best results come with a good diet, which I'm still working on. I've never seen such improvements from going to the gym, probably because I couldn't maintain the routine long enough and couldn't exercise on the spot at any time of the day without traveling, etc. I also noted that resistance bands are a lot more protective for my joints and lower back, which allows me to exercise for longer.I've researched quite a bit on the pros and cons of resistance bands vs. constant weight. Based on my experience, if you have the correct diet and consistency in working out, you can achieve 'the six-pack body' with resistance bands alone, as long as you keep adding extra bands over time as you progress. If you're aiming for professional bodybuilding competitions, you will probably need to work out with classical weights as well.I'm very pleased with this additional purchase and regret not trying resistance bands earlier in life. It has been a game changer for me.I've shared this whole story with the other seller from whom I purchased my initial set of resistance bands."
40lbs cable came with tears on the ends. Didn’t see it until I used it and the cable snapped almost instantly.
I bought these when I realized that I needed something quick and easy to use and workout now and then and these bands have not disappointed.They are reasonably durable and thick and as far as I can tell no production defects on my set.I've seen a few people complain about missing a band in their set but I received the full set so I have nothing to complain about.
"These resistance bands are fantastic! The quality is top-notch, and they offer a great stretch without any issues. I’ve really put them through the ringer, and they’ve held up perfectly. They’ve been incredibly helpful for my workouts and specific movements. Highly recommend for anyone looking for durable and effective bands."
"This is our second time ordering these. The first round lasted about a year of heavy heavy use before they started snapping & breaking on us. These are half the cost of what you would pay at the big box gyms, so I expect that. My husband, kids & I all use these for a variety of activity, so as long as you know these do have a shelf life and you’ll have to replace them with heavy use, they’re a great value add to your at home workout regimen."
"These bands are so strong and work really well you want to chnge up the weights for bands, changing up the workout!!"
"Excellent product, durable, highly recommend"
These bands are great.  The different strengths are very helpful in assisting me to obtain my goals.
Good quality.
I had a bicep tendon reconstruction surgery and wanted to go back to doing assisted pullups at home without any fancy gym equipment. These bands offered just that. I am now using the second to last band for 10 reps and hopefully in a few weeks I won't be needing them at all for my training.
"Great value, especially on discount!"
"The bands are not 100% like the pictures, the only difference is that bands are not branded, after 1 week trial the quality is good."
"Loved the quality of these bands, especially for the price. They don’t slide down even when sweaty. The resistance have stayed even after multiple use for over 2 months."
"The quality is 10× better than I'd imagine. I was worried about breakage when in use but I'm certain that they're secured. No slip, easy to use, and can't wait to upgrade to stronger band. I was even reached out to make sure I'm happy about the bands and I am!"
Great product good price the quality is great!
They came with a pouch to store them in.  Slight smell but that will dissipate over time.  Very comfortable to use.  I used them on my bare skin and they did not pinch or irritate.  I also have bigger legs (2-3X) and they were comfortable sitting above the knees.  They did not roll down nor did I struggle to put them on.
Nice bands
"Ordered Renoji Resistance exercise bands and have been using then for about a month: There are well made, wide and have not curled or cut into my large upper leg. The 3 different resistant level bands provided is a nice touch, but I use the black band (most resistance)."
"I was not expecting so much resistance in these bands! The 3 bands gradually increase from easy to difficult. I would say the one with least resistance (easier one) is a band that most people could use. The band with the most resistance is challenging! However, it gives me motivation to work up to that band! Also love the material on these. They are super comfortable and nothing like those rubber bands that pull your leg hair."
Love the fun colors. They work great
Good quality.
Very poor supposed resistance bands that offer no / little resistance
"Well, buckle up, because this is going to be a resistance-band review like no other!First off, let's talk about the packaging. These bands come in a cute little pouch that's perfect for taking with you on-the-go. It's like a little bag of tricks that can turn any location into a full-body workout zone. Beach? Check. Office? Check. Grandma's house? Check (but maybe wait until after dinner).Now, onto the bands themselves. These babies have some serious stretch to them, which means they're perfect for women of all shapes and sizes. Whether you're a petite powerhouse or a curvy queen, these bands will help you feel the burn in all the right places.But the real question is: are they fun? Well, let me tell you, I had a blast using these bands. I may have accidentally flung one across the room and hit my cat (sorry, Mittens), but that's just a sign of how much fun I was having.In all seriousness though, these bands are great. They're durable, easy to use, and they come in three different resistance levels so you can switch things up as you get stronger. Plus, they're a heck of a lot cheaper than a gym membership, so you can save your money for more important things, like a lifetime supply of chocolate.So if you're looking for a fun and effective way to get your sweat on, these resistance bands are definitely worth checking out. Just maybe keep them away from your pets."
"I love the color I boughtLove the variety of resistances. I started with the middle one, the 2 before were too easy for me. Feels well made and hasn't snapped on me. To be fair I just bought it and have used it a few times. No smell when I opened the packaging. Doesn't slip, make sure you wear leggings or some layer and do not use on bare skin unless you want to lose some hair lol.Love the pouch it came with as well"
"I bought these to use with one of my elderly clients. I find them very easy to use, well made, stretchable, versatile, and just the right size. They don't pinch and are comfortable when using."
"For the price I got them at I was skeptical, but after using them these held up extremely well!! The material felt strong and the colors were pretty. The only reason I give it a 4 is because the carrying bag ripped :( Still very worth the price"
Great for simple workout or a not so simple workout
"Started using bands. Love the colors. Great resistance. First use is obviously super tight, but it does tend to lose a little bit after first few uses. We will see how they last."
"These looked great and I was excited. First time I tried them they roll down and I feel like I'm getting bruises. It is extremely painful with a rolled rubber band to do squats.I only used the medium, cannot imagine these in the heavy and x heavy. My thighs are strong but a little meaty so it dug in ajwn rolled up many inches. Could barely complete 10 min of glute exersizes.Not durable enough, cheaply made. Guess i need tp spend a little more on these in thr future.Followed the instructions, these are not easy to use as they just aren't really what you need for glute exercise. Spend more than this.Update. I use these for my arm workouts and revised the rating from 1 star to 3 stars. I found a use."
Bands look and feel great but the bag to store them in came with a broken clip. Bought these for my 9 year old daughters dance class (conditioning) and she loves the colors!
These work well. They are compact and come in a convenient carrying case. They stay in place.
"Love the bright colours and the quality is great.  Comes with a little bag to store them to.Overall, love them."
I like them a lot . And the price is affordable. I love that they came with the little bag to put them inside .
Very good Products and the strengh variation is super.
"After a few months one of the bands broke, I tied it and figured it was just a bad band, then 2 more broke and now time has passed where I cannot return and no way to contact seller, no phone, email nothing of their selling site. Avoid this product. Waste of 15$UPDATE: They reached out to me and gave me full refund, thanks you!"
I think these are the best band resistance. Product I have ever bought they are very solid and they come with different strengths. And the kit is amazing it includes everything you need and what I like about it That price is affordable. Itâ€™s not so expensive for the quality you receive. I recommend buying it.
"These are a really good quality.  Everything is holding really well and give a good workout.  + The bag is easy to carry and it's all rather compactable.  They work well for their intended purpose.  They are comfortable to use and for the price, are overall very good to use."
Durable and very handy for home workouts. Easy to use and switch between workouts.
