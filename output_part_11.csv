My laptop camera all the sudden was not working correctly and became very blurry so I purchased this webcam. It is easy to use and install and works great (better than my laptop camera).
"This is an affordable, high-functioning little camera. The picture is very clear, sound quality excellent. The best feature of this camera is the adjustable viewing square that allows the user to zoom in or out to create the meeting room that is best for the call or video. This is a rare find at this price point! My only complaint is that the camera does not stay on my laptop as securely as I'd like. It has fallen off during meetings at just a little nudge of the desk. Wish the mounting brace had padding on it to make a more snug fit."
"Have had this for a few months and it still works great. Pretty solid 1080p picture quality for such an inexpensive camera, perfect for regular Zoom meetings or something similar."
I purchased this camera as a replacement for my old one in which the microphone went on the fritz. The picture quality is good and the microphone is nice and clean. Hook up was easy and I like the camera lens cover. I am satisfied with this product.
Great webcam. I use this daily instead of my laptop camera for teams meetings. Today I even used the speaker (instead of my headset) and everyone said they could hear me loud and clear. This has a nice picture when I’m on teams meetings and works great.
"I was about to buy the latest and greatest from NexiGo but after watching a Youtube review of it, the reviewer actually liked an older version better as the picture quality and lighting was much better, more natural, less overexposed spots/bright spots, and crisper image.The reviewer was right. I bought a cheaper NexiGo for my wife's setup but the colors and lighting wasn't good. But this model is really good, especially if you download the NexiGo App and tweak your settings for your particular lighting conditions.The only thing that's annoying is that every time I use the camera, it reverts to the default settings and I have to open the app, select my saved presets, and load them. Not a big deal but would be nice if there was a setting to make a certain preset the ""default.""As for the microphone, it produces a slightly too crisp sound. I had to cover both microphone openings on the unit with some magic eraser sponge pieces taped in place. Adding a small LED ring light to the top of my monitor really helped with the lighting/color. I didn't need a fancy, big lighting setup to get a nice, natural daytime look to my video image.Overall a great product for the price."
"I have weekly zoom meetings with my employer & team, so a working camera is crucial.  The built-in camera on my laptop started behaving like a 1980s TV with foil-covered rabbit-ear antennas on that one iffy channel (yep, I'm that old).  My boss was irritated with this situation, and she's not one to suffer irritants very long (No, she's not mean, just expects & provides high-quality).So I ordered this the second time my camera caused enough distortion to merit comment & it was here before the next meeting. It clipped & connected easily to my laptop, stayed put throughout the meeting, and the image was so clear that my boss asked if I'd gotten a new camera, stating that it was the cleanest picture ever.  It's performance hasn't decreased in the weeks I've been using it, so I'm very pleased."
I set this web cam up at the office for meetings. No it no drivers to install. Just had to plug it in. Was very clear.and came with a cap to cover the lens if not in use. Very good buy for the price.
"bought this to replace the 30fps model of this camera as it died after 1 year of use. so far its been worrking fine. I have had it for around 6 months and use it weekly. good quality for Zoom and Youtube streaming. Auto focus is ok could be faster but good the the price. hope it last longer then the 30fps verson. do not recommend using it to record video for youtube just seems to be a little off on the colors, but is good for streaming"
Love it.
"Works great, always wanted a webcam however… I don’t think I actually needed it. I’m not a streamer either. I don’t do anything that actually requires me to have a webcam. I really wasted money on something I didn’t actually need sadly.BUT, if you’re a streamer or your work requires a webcam, I think this would be worth for the money. I already have the Logitech app for my headset so all I did was plugged in the usb and it connected so it was easy.The picture quality is decent but in the app, you’re able to adjust settings to your liking. I think the microphone quality might be terrible but it’s fine because it’s 2024, why are we using webcam microphones lol.Anyways, I could’ve gotten other webcams like the ones trending via TikTok but I didn’t want to risk it and since this brand is known to be good, I spent the money."
"I recently purchased the Logitech C920x HD Pro Webcam, and it has exceeded my expectations! The video quality is outstanding, delivering full HD 1080p at 30fps, which makes a noticeable difference during video calls. Whether I’m on Skype, Zoom, or FaceTime, the clarity is fantastic, and my colleagues and friends have commented on how crisp and vibrant my image looks.The stereo audio is also impressive; the sound is clear and captures my voice without distortion, making it perfect for meetings and streaming. The HD light correction feature ensures I look great even in low-light conditions.Setting it up was a breeze—just plug and play, and it works seamlessly with my laptop. The adjustable clip allows me to mount it easily on my monitor."
"I purchased this camera on Prime Day Deals, and it is working with no issues. I updated my drivers before installing and it has a clear picture and sound. I use it for Zoom meeting mostly. Great for the money. It doesn't have any of the fancy features that the other Logitech cameras have but t fits my needs. The reviews were great on this camera as well by people that have used other brand cameras with all the features. I highly recommend."
"I was an upgrade to my previous Logitech Webcam.  Works well, easy set up, few problems.  A good value."
I had an old Logitech camera that I have been using for many years on my Mac Mini.  Lately it either wouldn't work or it would stop working in the middle of a call.  I borrowed my wife's camera and it worked fine.  So I decided to get the C-920x and so far I'm very happy with it.  It works on the Mac with Discord which is what we often use to video chat with family members.  The camera worked as soon as I plugged it in without me doing anything. The video is so good I'll have to hire a makeup man!  This is a big improvement in both audio and video quality!
"I've used two different webcams now. One was an Emeet which was complete rubbish. The other was an older Logitech variant. This C920 is VERY impressive. GHUB recognized it instantly! No fuss what so ever. Allows me to adjust all of my image settings like brightness, contrast, etc. I was able to turn off auto focus which was a huge benefit! I play a lot of edh and I can't recommend this camera enough."
"I had an old Logitech webcam that stopped working after a recent Microsoft Windows update. There was no driver update available, so I decided to get a new webcam. I plugged in this webcam and it just worked. No software installation was needed. It has excellent video and sound quality."
"I purchased this when my job allowed me to work remotely 3 days per week. It fits right on top of my curved monitor at the perfect height. The microphone is clear from what others have told me and the camera picture looks great. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good working web cam. For the record, I'm running Windows 11 and have had no issues with the camera being detected and working."
"I recently purchased the EMEET 1080P Webcam with Microphone, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The setup was incredibly easy with its plug-and-play functionality, and it was recognized by my computer instantly. The video quality is outstanding, offering crisp and clear Full HD 1080p resolution that makes my video calls look professional.One of the standout features is the dual omnidirectional microphones with noise reduction. They capture my voice clearly, even in a noisy environment, ensuring that I am heard perfectly during meetings. The wide 90-degree field of view is also a great addition, allowing more of my workspace to be visible without any distortion.The webcam performs exceptionally well in various lighting conditions, thanks to its low-light correction feature. Whether I’m in a brightly lit room or a dimly lit space, the image quality remains sharp and vibrant. The built-in tripod thread is a thoughtful touch, providing flexibility in positioning the camera exactly where I need it.Overall, the EMEET 1080P Webcam with Microphone is an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their video conferencing experience. It’s a great value for the price, and I highly recommend it for both personal and professional use."
"I bought the EMeet 1080P Webcam to improve video quality for Zoom and Teams calls, and it’s been excellent. Setup is simple, and for the price, both the video and audio quality are impressive. I recommend downloading Logitech’s G-Hub software, which makes optimizing picture and sound a breeze. I’ve used it for three years now without a single issue—highly recommend for anyone looking to enhance their video call experience!"
"I purchased this camera for an online class. It works well, was plug and play, super affordable. All in all the product is great for what it is. I really like that is came with a privacy cover. No issues with the picture when inside the focus range, or the mic both are super clear. I will say that I only use this camera for testing. I have never attempted to use this camera for anything else because I have no desire to stream or make video calls.The only ""issue"" I have is the listing. I really wish it had been in the product name that this is a fixed focus camera. There is another model of this camera on this listing for an Auto-focus camera for only 5 dollars more and I miss took the AF to mean Air Force (all thanks to growing up in a military community,) thinking it was just for a special color so I never even clicked on it. It is now the next quarter at my school and my new instructor is super picky about being able to read my name on my photo ID which this camera can't clearly provide. The auto-focus model can provide a clearer picture from slightly closer then the fixed focus camera can. I definitely learned my lesson and will be reading the full product description going forward.This is not the camera for you if you need to be able to show small print in a recorded video."
"Pic is good, mic sound good, wide angle view, easy use, would buy again"
"Really clear picture, well made, and no muss setup as well as affordable."
"For what this is... it is fine.  This is a great example of ""you get what you pay for"".  If you are looking for a quick replacement for your pc webcam, this might be okay.  I know youre not going to get incredible quality for 30 bucks, but my expectations were still a bit higher for this item, due to the product description and photos.  Otherwise, I would rate it higher and just accept that I bought a cheaper webcam.My main issues -The angle is super wide and not adjustable. I would've had to edit each video in post to ""zoom in"", which is just extra work.You can only make basic picture adjustments, even with the software that auto-installs upon plugging in the device. I could not ever get the exposure to look anything but overexposed.The picture is not super clear, maybe unless you have perfect lighting.  Just with regular warm room lighting, I had serious white glare on my face.The picture can be a little... ""jumpy""(?) lol - hopefully you kinda know what I mean.  Nothing drastic, but just enough to notice the lower quality.I never tested the mic.  The video quality was bad enough that I didn't ever actually try the mic.If you want to use this for streaming, or recording for youtube, etc.. and you are not a lighting/camera expert, just spend the extra money on a better cam.  I ended up getting the Logitech streamcam.  That one was great out of the box, before I even turned on my recording lighting.But again, if this is just for zoom calls, and you just need a quick and easy cam, maybe you can try this one.I should have returned it, but I waited too long. Oops lol."
Had a zoom call and no camera - ordered it and it came fast and flawless.  Great picture and worked perfectly
As someone who streams and was looking to update my camera this was definitely a great purchase without breaking the bank. Works well and has a great mic. Additive features to also make you look better and crisp.
"Great camera! , plug and play no config required , perfect price"

"This 1080p webcam is outstanding and exceeded all my expectations! The video quality is crystal-clear, with vibrant colors and sharp details that make video calls and streaming look incredibly professional. The built-in microphone captures sound perfectly, eliminating the need for an external mic, and the noise-cancellation feature ensures clear audio even in busy environments. The webcam is easy to set up, with a plug-and-play design that works seamlessly with my computer and software. Its adjustable mount and wide-angle lens provide versatility, making it ideal for any setup. Highly recommend this webcam for anyone looking for excellent quality at an affordable price!"
"Before buy this little one, I used my laptop camera for chatting which would give a poor image, when my face comes up in the display, it looks like I get some kind of illness, my face has a uncomfortable color.Well, this little camera has much better image defination and light control to keep things looking as they should be. The camera can be mounted on my laptop and is easy to adjust the field of view. It was very simple to install. it has USB cable carried, just plug in my laptop. Also no app needed when I connected the camera, just went into my settings and chose the camera as the video source and either the camera's speakers or my headphones as the audio source depending on what I feel like that day. The built in speakers are fine, and it have 2, as they say, it can make the sound more stereo, what I feel is that the sound is clear than my laptop's. Overall, a quality purchase for the cost and as long as you're okay with a relatively large camera on top on your monitor, this is a good choice."
"I like the black outlet and the special design, I can put it on the table or clip on top of my laptop, Well listed some featuers of it, Easy installation, solid picture quality, good light sensitivity, good price, and good quality build, texture is also not bad, have to say, a great value for my money"
This camera was truly just plug and play.  Plugged into my PC and was up an running with it in zoom.  The image quality is decent for a sub $100 1080p webcam and has a good field of view.  The clip easily supports it on top of the monitor.
"The camera was easy to connect and install. I use it for meeting so far and it seemed to work well. The picture quality is very good and the sound works well too, it is true FHD as they said. The view angel is pretty large for me and match with the movable clip, a bigger view!!!"
"I recently bought this webcam, and I have to say it's awsome! The clarity is impressive, and it’s incredibly quick in terms of performance. the focus is pretty good, image is clear and shows more details, even in different lighting conditions. I’ve been using it with a complementary light, and the results are amazing—crisp, clear video every time. Overall, this webcam has exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, reliable option."
"The camera has good quality and no need much time to set up. just plug it into a USB port on my computer and good to go. I like to put it on top of my monitor, also you can just place it on your table, when I get meetings on teams, just pick up, the vioce and sounds transimission are great, it has 1080P fhd and dual microphone inside as they described, which makes my meeting enjoyable and relaxing."
"I needed a camera for video calls. Plugged in and it just worked. Focus tracks well. I clipped it on the monitor, the design is great and steady. Worked perfectly without setup on both Zoom and Google Meet. just plug it in and those programs recognize it, the drives might be free to install. The image is fhd as advertised, and the microphone is good and clear too. If you're looking for one for your work, it is."
Easy to assemble and portable! The material wasn‚Äôt flimsy and it‚Äôs easy to store. The clamps were a life saver to keep the sheets from swaying. Also great length coverage! The gold was an 8 feet by 8 feet
"Awesome stand, light weight, easy to assemble and move around. üëå and"
"Giving this a 5 star for the easy set up.  I think with the little black sandbags given it is more for indoor use.  I used this stand outside to take school pictures for two days.  Both days were not that windy however the first day we got just a little breeze every now and then. The stand FELL OVER multiple times with the little breezes of wind. Nothing gusty! Light gently breezes really. Very frustrating.  Second day as you can see in my picture here I used my friends much bigger and heavier sandbags.  They worked much better! I still like this set up and the title does say studio, so for indoor you should have no problems with it falling over at all. I just wanted to let you know if you use it outdoors make sure you get yourself some larger heavier sandbags to use. I do really like it though."
"I‚Äôm a photographer who lives somewhere that experiences winter 9 months of the year. I needed a way to continue my business without the great outdoors on extremely cold days. This backdrop helped me so much with that! Easy to set up. Quality is okay. Sheet is fairly thin, think cheap bedsheet. Fairly stable and it comes with weighted bags to help support it if you feel it‚Äôs not sturdy enough. Here‚Äôs are some of my first shoots I did after purchasing. (Valentines minis)"
"easy to assemble, sturdy, and you can adjust the height and width. Simple and just what you need!!"
"Overall, a backdrop stand is a wise investment for anyone involved in photography or event planning. It combines functionality with ease of use, allowing both seasoned professionals and novices to elevate their projects. While it has minor stability issues outdoors, the benefits vastly outweigh this concern. I highly recommend adding a backdrop stand to your toolkit it's a game changer for creating stunning visual scenes. Whether for personal pleasure or professional service, you won't regret having this versatile piece of equipment on hand."
"Worked great- disassembled easily and comes with a storage bag, it was great for my purposes at a good price."
"I bought this backdrop stand to use as a stand for my projector to cut out patterns. While it holds the projector, and can support that weight, It is definitely not super sturdy without the sandbags. And unfortunately one of my sand bags has major holes in boths sides making it a major mess and difficult to repair. I'm using tape for now as I need to get to sewing. I would say the stitching on the bags leaves something to be desired. Hence my lower star review.  I'll update my review after I've used it a few times."
"I needed a way to show some large artwork and the Emart Photo Backdrop worked perfectly. Mind you, this was indoors. It came with sandbags (but no sand) that I yet have to test outdoors. It's not a heavy construction, which makes it light to carry, but it remains to be seen how it will fare outdoors. However, it was simple to assemble and looks professional. This product also comes with sandbags, but some other products don't, which is great. It also has some extra caps (to secure the cross bar) in case we lose the original ones. This product is worth it."
"Review of the 10' X 12' backdropCovered floor to ceiling on an entire wall.So VERY HAPPY with this purchase.Great for Birthdays, Anniversaries, Graduations, New Years most any celebration you can think of.Could also be used as a more permanent room decor.It makes a beautiful backdrop for photos, but what was most impressive (and unexpected) was how it changed the look of the room. It sets the ambiance in a room far better than balloons, banners and other smaller decor items. Best bang for the buck of any decor item I've ever purchased. It was perfect for our New Years Eve party.Obviously looks great in photos and since we purchased a very large backdrop there were no visible edges in photos and no one is standing beyond the backdrop, like what happens with smaller backdrops. Worked easily for groups of 10-12 people but would readily accommodate larger groups since it covered ceiling to floor and wall to wall.It is sturdy fabric, had no wrinkles when hung and we used 4 - 20lb command strips to secure it in place. I was afraid it would fall halfway through the evening but it was still hanging the next morning. I imagine it would stay there as long was we wanted with just 4 command strips. That means you can put it up days in advance.It's sturdy enough to use time and again for years to come. I don't see why it wouldn't last 10 or more years if taken care of.It's not sheer or see through. But, when we placed ours on a wall that had  alcove lights behind the backdrop, it did lighten it up a bit. While nothing too noticeable, it does add potential for a different feel to the backdrop. That may be something to try to see if you like it.Highly recommend."
"I used this for a 1920s Great Gatsby themed party, but this is such a versatile backdrop it could be used for many occasions. I plan to save it for other uses like new years eve, any celebration, etc. One thing I noticed about this backdrop is how easy it was to steam the creases out. I've bought other kinds that were really hard to steam.. but this one I was so pleasantly surprised how much I was able to flatten out. I almost wish I went for the full 8x8 size so that it touched the ground better on my backdrop stand. So check your sizing for your needs. All the pictures looked so nice with the backdrop. Classy and vibrant."
The product is study and great quality. It is not as vibrant as the photo but I still thought it looked good.
Bought for a grad party photo backdrop. Very nice quality. Reusable. Looks great in photos. Wish it had come in a bigger size. Our almost 6' tall people were too tall.
Worked out great with the Decorations and Balloons
This is nice and heavy and can be folded and reused and doesn't show fold marks.
"The SJOLOON Black and Gold Backdrop is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to elevate their party or family gathering. Whether you’re planning a birthday party, family event, or special occasion, this vintage-inspired vinyl backdrop brings an elegant touch with its black and gold design accented with gold spots. The backdrop is both eye-catching and versatile, offering a sophisticated background for photographs.The material is sturdy vinyl, which makes it easy to hang and wrinkle-resistant, ensuring your photos look professional without much hassle. The color contrast between black and gold creates a luxurious and timeless look that fits a variety of themes—be it a classy birthday bash or a chic celebration.The quality of the print is sharp, and it’s large enough to work as a statement piece behind your photo area or stage setup. However, depending on your setup, it might need some extra care with proper lighting to avoid shadows and ensure that the gold spots shine.If you’re looking for a backdrop that stands out and adds a touch of elegance, this one’s a great option that delivers both in style and practicality."
Ordered and received within 3 days...perfect for photo backdrop
"Got this for the fiancé’s Birthday, looked awesome and I can use it again in the future if needed.Would totally recommend!"
This made such a cute backdrop for New Years Eve photos and celebrations. It was large enough to not see the ends in photos and I'd definitely recommend for any glitzy celebration!
Bought as a backdrop for my kids Birthday party. Held up well! Looked nice. No wrinkles.easy to use and great length
Affordable and durable. Great price and great fabric for backdrop. Wrinkle resistant
"Wanted inexpensive white curtains to use as swags for barn wedding. These were perfect. Not too flimsy, not cheap looking. Good size. Was able to cover stalls and doors for a nicer aesthetic."
"Bought it for my daughter's 15th birthday party. Worked great! It's medium thickness, not see-thru, great flow; falls nice for a backdrop. Also, easy to maintain, regular wash and it still looks great."
I loved these curtains.  Really good quality.  Prefect for a wedding back drop
"Heavy, not sheer at all - which we wanted, but not all do.  Used for a wedding reception photo backdrop, keeping to reuse - possibly as window curtains. Heavy weight, but draped well! True, “bright” white."
I bought these for a backdrop for my Aunt’s wedding.  They were perfect.  Very nice material
I got this for a bridal shower to use as a Photo Booth area. The set up was so easy! It’s extremely affordable and durable! This is great for photo booths or photographers! I plan on using it to take photos of my son to save someMoney and will be using it at any event I host for a Photo Booth!
Bought to take photos of my artwork and I love the outcome! The photos are amazing and require minimal editing. Also works great for taking blacklight photos of my blacklight-reactive art. (I bought battery operated blacklights that are easy to set up in the lightbox).I don't have room to keep a lightbox set up at all times so I needed something that was easy to put up and take down. This one fits the bill and I'm excited to start using it more.
"I am thrilled with everything about this light box!This light box is compact for easy storage or portability (it collapses flat and stores nicely in the included tote) it is very quick easy to set up, has three different light modes (warm, white and soft) with adjustable brightness levels for each and also has a diffuser screen to soften the light,12 different background colors, and best of all it allows for multi-angle shooting (over head/overlook and straight on/tile).Such a great value for so much versatility!!"
"Great and easy to store, size as promised, lots of colors bg. Fast to fold or install."
"My only negatives so far, 1.  It would be nice to know what the light settings are.  2. Maybe there's no fix for this, but when taking pictures of custom paints, it doesn't show the color flips like the sun does.  Other than that, I love it.  A nice carry/storage case, a bunch of different background sheets that don't bleed through and fit in nice.  Way better light than most rooms have for taking pictures.  I'm always making things and I like to take pics of them, and this is going to make this a lot easier and give me nicer pictures."
Easy to use and great quality
"This box allows my husband to do the kind of photography he likes. It is light weight, collapses for easy storage and came with a pack of backgrounds that he likes.  A very good purchase for the price."
"I make small leather goods (wallets, lighter cases etcetera) this is exactly what I needed for my product photography. Very easy to set up and put away. The lighting is adjustable and meets my needs. A number of different colored backgrounds came with it. The one recommendation I have would be maybe to wear gloves when handling the backgrounds. Specifcially the black one seems to pick up any oils that might be on your skin. 10 out of 10 would recommend for anyone needing to do product photography for smaller items."
