"If you have easy to handle hair it's good but it you have hard to handle hair, it's going to hurt to pull through. I loosen up the ponytail and still hurts! Lord have mercy. I'll give it as a gift."
Good quality weight to them. The last bunch I bought were so flimsy they would snag hair because they were too floppy.
Good and does the job intended
"These towels are so soft and thick and really do help dry my curly hair.  I like the colors I selected, they are true to what his pictured and they are a nice size.  I previously ordered other towels for my curly hair and they were very thin and did not wash well these are super thick, super absorbent and very comfortable to wear.  Great purchase."
Really love this microfiber towel for drying my hair naturally without using heat. Have to say the price was really nice for receiving three of them. I've never used them before and must say I really love them and will purchase more and use them for now o. I love the way they feel and the water it gets out of my hair. So much better than a towel and easier on the hair with no pulling or damaging happening anymore. Plus they actually look cute on unlike a towel so that's also a plus. Nice to buy things and they work like they should and hoped for. These microfiber head towels are just great!
So soft and easy to use. Helps dry my hair and not damage it like other towels. My hair is very thin and fine and can use all the help I can get to keep it healthy. These stay well and are very soft. No heavy on my head and do not pull my hair. Colors are super cute too!
"These hair turbans are nice and thick and feel luxurious, but have an elastic loop and a button on the bottom to keep it in place. The elastic band is on the inside and is so small and tight that it is hard to get it on the button. I struggle with it each time I use it after washing my hair. I will keep the set because they are absorbent and soft."
"These hair towels are fantastic!  I had read the reviews and was surprised when they arrived in such a tiny package!  However, once they were opened they expanded and were very soft!  It was easy to wrap and swaddle my hair and the button was easy to access and kept my hair in place while absorbing a large majority of the water. Highly recommend!"
"These were a great value for the high quality microfiber hair towels. The package contained three hair towels that were pretty colors. These hair towels make drying my hair quicker and were extremely easy to use. Upon opening the vacuum sealed packaging, there were no apparent bad odors. The manufacturer provided easy to follow directions on the steps to take prior to use. These are easy to use in addition to being very soft and fluffy!"
"These are perfect for drying hair, fit well, and easy to use , love the softness and colors , great buy"
"I am impressed with how well these towels retain water. Especially considering my hair is just below my shoulders, and thick. They work surprisingly well and are lightweight, even wet, and they dry fast once they are hung up. I definitely recommend."
A very good quality for this price
Lovely product
"Backstory: was interested in the Dyson, then Shark, but couldn’t justify the cost. I have T3’s curlers and DryBars dry brush, so I had the individual tools.Sephora Sale, I saw the Bondi with great stars, could buy it for $150, so I immediately pulled the trigger. Ended up returning it, and bought this for $70 more during Black Friday. Including my review of both products in case it’s helpful for decision making.BondiInitially: I loved it. I could blow dry my hair in 5 minutes and do a quick blow out in 10-15 minutes.Additional thoughts: 1.) The appliance itself felt cheap compared to my T3, but I had no frame of reference for airstylers.  2.) I hated how hot the styler attachments got, I had to use my hot pad to remove them/put new ones on (like the different direction barrels).  3.) The curls do not last, but I really liked the circular brush/blow out style I was getting, so was still happy. 4.) The air suction isn’t strong, whatsoever. I don’t know the numerics of my hair type, but I am a natural blonde, very fine hair, slightly wavy, but it is very thick and quite long (natural waist maybe?). The air suction on the curlers would barely pick up any of my hair, I truly can’t imagine how it would work on coarser hair. I’m talking 1/3-1/2 of the hair I’d normally section/curl with my iron. 5.) I would get heat marks in my hair during curling, which was super alarming to me (I use protectant, but I do not color my hair) Then, I was using the circular brush, and the whole attachment snapped off. In investigating, the plastic of the the connection would get so hot that it would bend the plastic — making the attachments unusable.SharkImmediately, the appliance is more sturdy, substantial and feels quality. The difference feels like Bondi=Plastic, Shark=Metal.Speed: Dried my roots in 1 minute, root to tip in 4 min, and curled in an additional 9 min.Notable improvements:1.) Better materials2.) No troubles with the heat of attachments, there’s grips at the ends, but the attachements themselves don’t get as hot either making it super easy to change out3.) beautiful curls on the first try, and have lasted this far with no hairspray4.) huge improvement in air suction/strength, I can actually curl normal sections of hair5.) no heat marks thus far!I would highly recommend saving until the Shark is in budget!"
"Just got this today. Initial review-- Dries hair FAST, I have very fine hair but a LOT of it, and this dried my hair in maybe half the time of a regular dryer- I dried my hair on the next to lowest heat setting- it didn’t burn my head at all but was still very effective at drying- I used the curling rods (comes with 2, one for left side and one for right side of head) and was pretty pleased with how easy they were to figure outSee attached photos- for context, I used no products in my hair to combat frizz or add volume, etc. Had just washed my hair and was excited to test this out. Blow dried my hair until it was about 85% dry, and then grabbed a few sections to test the curling rods. I literally half-added this and only curled a small number of sections in my hair, so just know that if you spend more than literally 6 minutes curling your hair with this, I think it’ll look ten times as good.This thing isn’t too heavy, and the attachments are very easy to switch out (they do have a locking mechanism so they don’t fall out while you’re using them). A lot of people have commented on the volume, but honestly- it doesn’t sound any louder to me than a typical blow dryer? The noise is slightly more high pitched than a normal dryer, so maybe that’s what people don’t like, but after 5 seconds of using it the sound literally became white noise to me. Honestly, I think it’s quieter than most hotel dryers.My one complaint isn’t really a complaint, I just didn’t read and realize that there’s a different curling wand for each side of the head. So you’ll basically curl one side of your head, then swap out the rod and curl the other side. I kind of wish it was just one rod to do the whole head, but with how they’re designed that wouldn’t work (unless you didn’t care about which way the curls face.) Each rod is clearly marked on the end with an L or an R so there’s no guesswork.As someone who loves to have nice hair but is infinitely lazy and unskilled with a curling iron or round brush, this seems like it was very well worth the purchase for me. If you’re already a pro at doing hair, you might not get as much use out of this set, but for me I’m very happy with the purchase.I chose this over the dyson because of the price point, but also because I’ve owned other products (vacuums lol) from each brand and I’ve found Shark products to be more reliable and dependable than Dyson stuff.Update: two weeks in and I’m loving this. Surprisingly, my favorite attachment is the round brush. It’s so easy to use that with the dryer to dry my hair and give it volume so my roots aren’t so flat. This thing also travels well- when your straighten out the dryer barrel, this was super easy for me to fit in my carry on bag and then I just threw the paddle brush attachment in my backpack. Easy peasy and I was able to use it to keep my hair looking full and lovely on a long weekend trip to the lake. Very happy with this purchase.Edit 2- 2 month update. I freaking love this thing. I actually don’t use the curling wands very often- I’ve been using both brush options to get volume and even curls in my hair. I’ve never been skilled (or patient) at doing my hair but this thing has been pretty much a game changer for me. Walked out of the house the other day looking like I had just gotten my hair professionally done, felt like a goddess."
"I have very thick hair and it typically takes me 45 minutes to an hour to style — with the Shark I did everything in less than 20 minutes! It dries it so fast and I love that you can control the air speed and the temperature. I’ve curled it and given myself a blow out and both results were amazing and it’s so easy to use. If you’ve been debating whether to treat yourself to one, take this as your sign to just do it!!!!"
My wife’s hair looks 20 again.
"Coming from a person who has used both the revlon round brush dryer & the cheap knock off dyson I say this is worth it, if you are wanting a Dyson but don’t want to shell out that amount of money.Pro- fast, powerful, has the same tech for making a blown out curl.Con- buttons could be closer together, needs a longer hair attachment or just 1 singular barrel for curling which can do both ways, & you have to hold the cold shot for a little longer to actually feel it.Never used a real Dyson, but used the knock off which I do not recommend gets too hot & after prolonged use it shorted out. Also using a revlon it’s a good thing for beginners to actually get the hang of trying to get a good blow out with a slight curl but it’s always hot no real temp control & if you are wanting a true cool down to set your curl you will need a standard hair dryer to actually set it. The shark has the power & the comfortability all in one."

Update 9/2/24I've used these clippers now about 8 times and STILL have 75% battery life AND no loss in cutting power. AMAZING! They cut REALLY good. The T - cutters aren't all that but you can use them on your beard or a general hairline shape up. Still worth every penny. I get compliments all the time - where so I go to get my hair cut etc lol. GET THESE!!Original post below:I had purchased cordless Trimmers before, about 3 years ago, and was NOT impressed whatsoever and send one back and threw the other away.  Because of my experience and the vendor, I wasn't going to purchase these.I have a pair of clippers now which are Andis Fade Masters and an economical Wahl that I've owned the or at least 15+ years and I love them. The Andis, while nice, had an aluminum case and they get very hot if you use them and the Wahls are decent, the guards are sloppy in their attachment to the clippers and slip off and not as much cutter power or,imo, a clean cutting clipper but served the purpose.I've been cutting my hair for well over 32 years and I am VERY good at it. I got tired of getting the Andis blade either sharpened or replaced a lot also - guards werent the great - it was how they attached - didn't stay on and poorly designed imo but a well cutting clipper with powerI hadn't cut my hair since 2013 and it was plenty long and thick. I always got my hair cornrow braided by excellent stylest but it became a chore. Pricing, finding a good one, the drive and constant increases in cost which started out around $55/$60 and now $95- $200  for 4 stitch braids and I get it done evaery 2 weeks.It took a long time to cut it down because the blades weren't that sharp and and one tall guard.I decided to order these because it had many features I liked, mainly 2 different clippers. The came in 5d at 100%. I oiled them and put them to use.I mentally questioned the battery life, and power of these clippers -  they were cheap. To my surprise they were powerful even as the battery power the down a bit, and the all the issues I had with the cordless, Wahl and Andis. To be fair, if you cut as much hair as I did over that long time period, buying new blades is good thing.Use them, LIKED them both and it came in a nice travel case, well arranged and all the goodies.I'm glad I purchased these. My hair came out GREAT and was faded effortessly.Buy the clipper oil  though it comes with some and if you are male, straight razors are a necessity.Loved using these and they are now my go-to clippers.  I hope they last more than 1 yr, and I def recommend these at this point.Great clippers for the price, detail, they look great and perform well.Glad I got these and you will be as well.Take the leap!"
"This kit does exactly what it‚Äôs supposed to do! I love the clean look, the cape that‚Äôs included and the different guards for the small trimmer. Easy to use and cordless (which is so helpful with my moving 3-year old)! It is sharp but not to the point of harming. More durable than other brands I‚Äôve tried!"

These are excellent. They are super easy to use, have plenty of guards to choose from, cut evenly, sharp and hold a good charge. My son got these to learn to start cutting hair and they were perfect for a beginner. The design is also super clean."
"These are a great purchase!! Not only do they come with the clippers, but they have a liner too?? You can‚Äôt beat that! They are heavy weight and don‚Äôt feel cheap at all! They fit great in the hand. I have been using these for around 2 weeks straight of cutting, and i‚Äôm just now having to charge them so the battery life is great! They cut really good as well. They also look amazing with the gold look!! Must get!!"
I can't stress enough how well made the clippers are. They are smooth and cut so well. The price is great and the charge last a long time.
"The package was a day late,  but no biggie. The trimmers worked really well. Overall great quality product! The set came with everything you would need, including a little extra, like a cape to keep hair off you. I would definitely recommend buying this set, it's worth the price."
"Cut my hair long really good, and the trimmers are sharp."
"Wow - what a find - For someone with thinning hair who has opted to self maintain for years, not getting a power cord caught on cabinet knobs, and having the freedom of wireless cutting is awesome. I was impressed with the engineering of this product, the precision tooling of the blade and construction consisting of metal parts, which are usually plastic on other trimmers. Yes, because of the battery it may be slightly heavier than other corded trimmers, but it is balanced and has a great feel to use. The bonus is it just looks cool, too! Highly recommend and would purchase again."
"I've been using this for a little less than 2 months. So far, so good. The blade is sharp and cuts evenly. Easy to clean using the included brush (this particular version is not meant to be submerged in water or used in the shower). I use it mainly for beard trimming (< 3 to 4 minutes of continual operation per trim), so the battery life is not an issue for me (still using the original charge after several weeks). There is a wide selection of trimmer guides included (1/2; 1; 1-1/2; 2; 3; 4), a USB cable for charging, a brush for cleaning the blade, and and a small plastic vial of oil for the blade. Also comes with a carrying/storage case made of soft rubber. Excellent value for the price and, so far, one of the best in class."
"This was an amazing deal for an awesome item. It‚Äôs exactly as advertised. Good solid and quiet trimmer. Both trimmer and clippers are fully rechargeable thru USB. Unfortunately, it does not come with a charging block, but any 5v USB charger will work. I bought this on sale, but definitely worth the full price. Super, super quiet, any very very sharp!"
"Nice set of many bracelets for a low price. I like the colors. Note that there are no reds, oranges, yellows if you're looking for something in that color family. This set includes black, white, purples, blues. They are a little snug but not bad."
"To be honest, I was expecting for a lower quality by considering its price, but nope. Very good for daily use. Good quality of material."

I think these are so much fun! Great price for a pack of 6! Size fit me perfectly, and they look high quality. Great gift idea to give as one set on its own, or the entire set of six."
It‚Äôs cute and served its purpose for the price
The bracelets are colorful but are to small for adult wrists.
These bracelets are so great for everyday wear! I get lots of compliments on them. There colors are so pretty!
"These are very nice looking.  I actually bought these for Toys for Tots gifts for the girls that are between 10-14 years old.  At that age they really aren't playing with dolls anymore.  So wanted to get something cute that young girls would like, and these are prefect.  I was even able to seperate them out to more than just 6 sets of gifts, and putting in little clear sealed baggies.  And they are nice enough for us older ladies as well!  I am buying some more today to make so more gifts baggies."
"The bracelets are separate pieces , so I am able to mix and match to get the desired color scheme. I am also able to take out any of the bands that are uncomfortable. I always receive many complements when I wear them."
Great colors and can be interchanged!
"Really pretty bracelets they match just about anything, very large variety too"
"Terrible, cheap!  I wore a set to a party and my wrist turned greenAnd the colour came off on the bracelets as well. All of the sets that are a gold colour or a shiny fake silver colour will turn your wrist green. You have to take them out and just wear the beaded ones. Most likely will end up in garbage. Waste of money"
"I bought this as a late birthday and celebration gift for myself. I had my son at 24 weeks and I really wanted the perfect piece of jewelry to wear daily with him in mind. I found this necklace and fell for it, I love the way his name looks and I love that it has our birthstone too. I've worn it everyday since receiving it and as someone who's usually very sensitive to metal I'm surprised to say this necklace has never bothered my skin and holds up well for everyday use even when I accidentally wear it in the shower. It also cleans up very well with just a little soap and water it shines beautifully. Thank you so much for making this wonderful most beautiful piece of jewelry for me, it's my very favorite necklace and jewelry piece in my collection.Update:I had a really good experience with the seller, the day I posted this review my necklace had broken out of nowhere and sort of just fell off my neck, I realized the clasp had broken so I messaged the seller to see if I could receive a replacement and they happily did so. My only complaint is that it's not quite as pretty as the first one the text isn't quite as big so it's harder to read and the peridot charm is a bit dull compared to the original but I'm still very grateful and I love my new necklace I'm still sad my old one broke but I'm so happy with the way the seller handled the issue. I'll continue to come back for pieces from this seller! (New necklace pictures are the ones with blue shirt)"
"Very nice, high quality necklace"
Love this! I bought three more! so cute and simple perfect gift for loved ones! Give time because it does take some time to get so don’t expect to have it in a day or two but so worth it!
I bought this personally engraved necklace for my 18 year old granddaughter's birthday and she loves it.  The necklace is dainty and well made.  Buy it!!!
"I love it, just purchased 5 more for friends. Shipped faster then expected. I know everyone will like theirs too. Very dainty and nice chain, I wasn't allergic to the chain."
I feel like this is something important to know prior to ordering because now my name looks like a thing or saying versus addressing a person
"This is a really pretty high polish necklace with lots of sparkle. March stone color is perfect (aquamarine). Presentation box is very nice with Mignon & Mignon engraving. As other reviewers have noted, the sizes of stone and coin are petite. While dimensions are accurately included on the listing, posted images vary in their depiction of the actual product. Some do not show true (petite) size. Buyers should rely on the quoted dimensions. Customer service was fantastic in responding to my issue with size and sent me a replacement. I compliment them for above-and-beyond service. Kudos to Mignon&Mignon for making customer satisfaction their #1 priority."
"This product is dirt cheap, and I was not expecting the quality to be this good. It gets worn in water without being dried off, it gets worn everyday, etc, and it is still holding up like its brand new. Super cute, cross is a little smaller than expected though. Extremely light, to the point where it feels like you aren't wearing anything. Super easy to put on and take off, and the gold colour compliments any outfit."
"I wear this necklace all day every day. I don‚Äôt take it off. I‚Äôve worn this necklace for 3 weeks straight now, and I am SO HAPPY that I found it. My old cross necklace broke, and for like 6 months I‚Äôve been searching the internet for a new one that won‚Äôt tarnish (since I wear mine 24/7). I randomly came across this necklace while clothes shopping on Amazon and it‚Äôs probably the best purchase I‚Äôve made on Amazon in a very very long time. The quality is amazing, the sparkle is great, the chain doesn‚Äôt get caught in my hair like other ones were doing, and the cherry on top is it does not tarnish. Also, it‚Äôs the perfect length. I have a slightly bigger neck than most and it still hangs to the perfect length. It‚Äôs still the beautiful color it was when I got it and my neck doesn‚Äôt turn black and blue from cheap gold. And the value for your money is insane. GET THIS NECKLACE!! You won‚Äôt regret it."
It is an awesome necklace it doesn‚Äôt fade and I wear it all the time I never take it off and all the diamonds are still in place and it comes in a cute little bag for storage I love it I definitely recommend purchasing this it is small but perfect it doesn‚Äôt dangle to low or get tangled and is very light weight and it is a lovely gold color I love itüòç
The cross is shiny but the chain is a bit too long for me but still really cute necklace
"I just got my PAVOI CZ cross necklace! It looks elegant. The cross is small but dainty, just the way I like it, any bigger will be showy. The adjustable clasp is OK to handle but will be easier if  made a little bigger.  Well, I got the VERMEIL version so hope it will last for quite a while."
It is so sparkly and cute. It is easy to put on and has the perfect length for me.
"It's cute and quality seems ok. It was a good value for the price and something my 13 year old is happy with. As of right now, it hasn't turned her skin green or tarnished. It has also held up. She seems pleased. It's sparkly...I think she wishes the chain was a tad longer."
This necklace is cute and perfect for my daughter. It has a nice sparkle to it and the chain seems like a perfect length.
"Really beautiful necklace, I never take it off it‚Äôs been 2 weeks and it hasn‚Äôt changed colour so far I keep it in the shower. For the price you can‚Äôt go wrong, and you can adjust the chain for any length. I love it"
"I broke my necklace and was looking for a temporary necklace until l got another one at Christmas. Received the necklace not expecting it to be good ,but to my delight  it is really beautiful, it looks much better than in the picture, looks expensive and the diamonds look real very sparkly,and is not flimsy ,the price was very resonable So l won't be replacing this necklace"
"very good quality, the chain feels expensive almost and the gem is very cute"
"I was going to upload a photo but it doesn‚Äôt show it‚Äôs shine and beauty, Pictures do no justice! Very beautiful necklace very satisfied with this purchase. Looks real and expensive. I just received it so I can‚Äôt say how long it‚Äôll last so I will update on that.Update: I did find the same necklace on SHEIN for $1.43"
"This is my favorite necklace, it is simple but very pretty. So far the metal has not tarnished at all? which I impressed by because of the cheap price."
The necklace is the perfect length and dainty. The only problem I had was the knot in the chain. I wore it anyways and it was fine. I'm hoping I can get the knot out. I thought the gemstone color and chain were pretty.
love this necklace. super cute and good quality so far
"I got this for my sister for her birthday gift and might I just say, I should have gotten myself one too üò≠. It is so pretty and I got it on a sale so now I really wish I had gotten one. It isn‚Äôt too long or short, and she loves her birth stone so much so I know she will probably never take it off! You won‚Äôt regret getting it for you or a loved one. Doesn‚Äôt look cheap or anything. Looks like it‚Äôs real gold 100%!"
"This is a beautiful necklace, and it is comfortable to wear. I have received many compliments.  I only wear the necklace when I am going out somewhere and then I take it off.  It still looks brand new.  I bought the necklace because it looked so good on my daughter, who wore her necklace everyday and didn't take it off, even in the shower.  After about two months, the necklace tarnished.  I predicted the necklace would tarnish, but she stated the reviews were good.  So be aware if you plan on wearing this necklace everyday, it will probably tarnish.  If you are only going to wear it and then take it off, you will be happy with your purchase."
"So cute and looks expensive, I wear it around the clock and doesn‚Äôt tarnish"
"Very pretty pearl necklace! Just the right size pearls, noticeable but not too large. Looks very pretty with a v-neck or open collar top. I’m a small boned older woman and this necklace was just the right amount of bling, very classy!"
Very cute necklace set(1 individual necklaces) for a a gift
They started to tarnish after just a few wears so bare that in mind when buying
"These two necklaces look so good. I already wore them several times and they don’t change color, very durable. Incredible value."
The necklace I ordered was nicer than I imagined  I love it. Will reorder more la necklaces soon
I was very disappointed in the quality. Looks and feels like Shein (cheap) products. Could have gotten it at Shein for $1. Won't make that mistake again.
