Extremely easy to use display is amazing . So much lighter than one using a cell phone.More controller options . What more can I say. Very happy with purchase. Would buy again.
"Works really well with my new NEO Drone, warms up pretty fast."
It great product for great drones. Hopefully hopefully the drone ban issue will be resolved as DJI makes the best drones and remotes for them.
So advanced and intuitive in every way.
"If you own a DJI Neo, you’ve got to get the RC2 or one of the other compatible DJI controllers. The little $200 drone is super charged by the capability of this thing. Highly recommend! 10/10"
"I bought this controller to replace the controller that came with my DJI mini 4 pro drone. My phone is in a case and it won't fit well in the controller unless I take my phone out of the case. This controller has the built in screen which solves that problem. The screen is bright enough to see on bright sunny days, although a shade makes it easier to see. I had no problem connecting it to my already paired drone."
My previous RC Controller is incompatible with my new Mavic Air 3S so I had to get the RC2 which works great.
Amazing quality for Neo Drone.
seems quite robust nice screen good feel to control sticks
Don't be fooled by other similar products on Amazon. They are priced about the same but aren't authentic DJI products. This one is. Make sure it's sold by Amazon. Expect ~25-35 minutes in real world conditions depending on how windy it is. They advertise 46 min max flight time but that is in perfect windless conditions without recording before dropping dead out of the sky 0 percent. Know what to expect so you won't be disappointed.
100% The real deal OEM DJI NIB AIR 3 Battery!
Liked everything except the batteries going low
"This is an OEM DJI battery for the Air 3. Of course it comes with the quality I expect from DJI products, however it is overpriced in my opinion. That said, the battery for any DJI drone isn't something you want to cheap out on.As far as battery life, I usually get about 30-40 minutes out of a single charge, though this can vary wildly depending on environmental conditions and what you're doing with the drone. DJI advertises 46 minutes for this battery but that's pretty much the best case scenario under optimal conditions. Most of the time you'll probably get around 30-35 minutes.Again, this is an OEM battery from DJI and I would definitely recommend this over any 3rd party battery. I'm giving this battery 4 stars, I only knocked one off due to the price."
"I'm very satisfied with this product, work perfectly right out of the box, unlike the mavic 3 pro battery. Highly recommended."
"First they shipped me a defective Air 3 battery. I returned it and asked for another one. Then they ship me a battery for a Mini 4 Pro.  I went to send that back, and they won't replace it and are telling me it will take up to 30 days for me to get my money back. It took like 3 seconds for them to take my money. Why does it take 30 days to get it back? I just want a freaking battery for my Air 3. How hard can it be?"
Exactly what you claimed it was thank you
"Whats the say? It's literally just a factory DJI battery, the same as all the others. Not different, better, or worse. Overpriced, though. These things are way more expensive than they should be, especially with how they last, both in duration and total life. With heavy use, they DO need replaced, and give about 30 to 35 min of flight time. Expect about 25-30 min, because you won't be running it to complete 0%. Most of the time you'll be ending the flight around 10-15% battery."
"Purchased this charging hub to charge the batteries on my Specta Air drone. Although the drone is not ""DJI"" and the batteries are not interchangeable between the DJI Air 3 and the Specta Air, this charging hub charges the batteries without any issues. I use an Amazon Basics 65w wall charger and USB-C cable and two batteries charger in about 2 hours (1 hour each)."
The charger works as stated and a MUST have
Don’t know why I didn’t get a power supply or power cord so it was perfectly useless
I had a little trouble getting it to work at first then got it figured out and it works great
"I’ve been using the DJI Air 3 Battery Charging Hub, and it has significantly improved my workflow by keeping my drone batteries charged and ready to go. This hub allows me to charge up to three batteries sequentially, which is incredibly convenient when I’m out for a full day of shooting. Here’s what I like and where I see room for improvement:Pros: 1. Sequential Charging Efficiency: The hub charges batteries one at a time, prioritizing the one with the most charge, so I can get back in the air as quickly as possible with a fresh battery. This feature really helps when time is of the essence. 2. Compact and Portable Design: The hub is lightweight and easy to carry, making it a breeze to pack with my drone gear. It doesn’t take up much space, which is ideal for travel. 3. LED Indicators: Each battery slot has an LED indicator to show charging status, so I always know which batteries are ready. This clear display makes it easy to track progress at a glance.Room for Improvement: 1. Simultaneous Charging Option: While sequential charging is efficient, an option to charge all batteries simultaneously would be helpful for situations where I have access to a power source for a limited time. 2. Longer Power Cable: The included power cable is a bit short, which can limit placement options. A slightly longer cable would provide more flexibility, especially when working in outdoor settings with limited outlets. 3. Improved Cooling: The hub tends to get warm during extended charging sessions. Enhanced ventilation or a small fan could improve heat dissipation and ensure a longer lifespan.Overall, the DJI Air 3 Battery Charging Hub is a reliable and effective tool for keeping my batteries ready and maximizing my flight time. With a few minor upgrades, this could easily be the best charging hub for DJI Air 3 owners. Highly recommended for frequent drone users who value convenience and efficiency!"
"I concur that DJI makes great drones at many price points, and for many skill levels. Every one of the dozens of articles I read before purchase had DJI at the top of the recommended list. My only problem was deciding which drone to buy as a novice. I didn’t want to buy a >$1K package and have the drone fly off into the sunset, never to be seen again, on my first flight.  So, I split the difference on risk vs. cost/performance.  I bought a DJI, but not the newest model.  The better, but still very similar, model 4 would have cost more than twice as much for a similar package as this model 2.I’m happy to report that this drone is a great choice for adult beginners. It does not have the collision avoidance or 4k camera of the newest model, but it is essentially the same for basic setup and flight control and its camera performance is adequate. It really is a very nice drone, and I’m very happy I bought the DJI. It is relatively easy to set up and very easy to learn to fly. I really like the Mini2 SE and I’m glad I bought it.One thing I didn’t know about drones before researching is that all drones above 250 grams must be registered with the FAA, and some drones must initialize a flight approval each time they are used. So, if you buy a drone that weighs over 250 grams, be sure you understand what you are buying. It’s one thing to have to pay $5 and register once online, it’s another to have to be within cellphone signal range to initialize flight.  With the latter type you could be miles into a hike and not be able to use your drone at all due to no cell signal for flight authorization. The DJI Mini 2 SE is not either of those.Two things you will need, which are not included in this kit, are a charger plug adapter and a mini SD type memory card. It’s absolutely ridiculous that a $500 package, that includes everything else, does not include the plug adapter. DJI’s >$1K packages don’t either.  You need an 18 Watt or greater plug, such as the newer Apple devices use. Yes, most of us already have one, but that’s not the point. DJI should just charge $5 more and include one in the kit!  The memory card isn’t technically necessary but the images and video will be much higher quality if you use one. The DJI Mini 2 SE supports up to a 256 gigabyte card. A high quality name brand card is only ~$25 and a 128 gigabyte is half that. If DJI had included the SD card and charger plug, they would have only had to increase the price of this package by less than $20, and the customer would not have to scramble around trying to source missing pieces of the appropriate parameters. Another issue is the formatting of the SD card… It needs to be formatted in the drone itself but I never found any mention of this in DJI’s instructions. Query YouTube for a quick tutorial, it’s less than a 30 second process once someone walks you through the appropriate menus on the controller app.In summary, I have no real complaints just suggestions, this is a great drone made by the leader in this market segment. It’s high quality, easy to fly and many of the parts are interchangeable with prior and current models. Its basic flight capability is very comparable to the more expensive DJI models, but it is edged out by them on camera resolution and advanced features like object avoidance, but it costs significantly less. If price is not a concern, I’d recommend the Mini 4 unconditionally, it is better. However, the Mini 2 is also an excellent choice and I’m glad I chose it for my first drone. I may upgrade at some point in a few years, once I have a lot more experience, but I’m completely satisfied with this drone and would recommend it or buy it again in the same circumstances."
"The DJI Neo Mini Drone is an impressive piece of tech, especially for its compact size and weight of just 135g. As someone who loves capturing high-quality video on the go, the 4K UHD camera really blew me away. The video is sharp and stabilized, making it great for both casual flying and professional-looking footage. Plus, the built-in propeller guards add a layer of safety, perfect for flying in tight spaces.What I love most about the DJI Neo is the AI subject tracking—it follows me seamlessly without the need for a controller. The palm takeoff feature is incredibly fun and convenient, and the drone is smart enough to handle most flying situations on its own. The QuickShots feature makes creating dynamic shots super easy, and the controller-free operation is a game-changer for those who want a streamlined, hands-free flying experience.If you’re looking for a lightweight drone that packs a punch with its features, this is the one. The DJI Neo is perfect for both beginners and experienced flyers who want to capture incredible shots without worrying about controlling every move. Highly recommend!"

I have one question—how on earth is this thing less than four hundred dollars?! This is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made on a drone. It’s perfectly steady, and the camera is stunning. The quality of the footage is so clear and crisp, it’s almost unbelievable. And the range? It can go so far away that I can’t even fathom the distance.After receiving a terrible drone order that was a complete waste of money, I truly understood just how incredible the DJI Mini 2 SE is. It felt necessary to leave this review despite the fact that not many people might see it because the difference is night and day. This drone is leagues above anything else I’ve tried.Despite a few crashes, this drone works flawlessly and feels like it should be worth at least $1,500. The return-to-home feature is incredibly precise—literally down to the inch—and the motion sensors are spot-on as well.It's also ridiculously easy to fly, which is perfect for anyone, whether you're a beginner or an experienced pilot. The best part? You don’t even need to register it because it’s so lightweight. Plus, it’s super easy to bring into other countries. I packed this drone into a suitcase full of heavy shoes and other items for a trip from Virginia to Turkey. The suitcase was handled roughly, and the boxes inside were damaged—including the drone's box—but when I unpacked everything, the drone was completely unscathed. The build quality is just that good!Here’s something insane to think about: imagine there’s an island on the Chesapeake Bay you want to fly over. It’s 7 km away, and this drone has a 10 km range without any signal extenders. But here’s the catch—your drone isn’t fully charged. You figure it’s fine and put the drone in sport mode to help it get there faster. But you completely underestimate how long the charge will last (which, by the way, is super long with this amazing piece of tech). When you’re 4 km out, the drone warns you that it doesn’t have enough charge to go much further and return safely. If you don’t listen, it’ll automatically turn back on its own. It’s like this drone is designed to be unbreakable and impossible to lose!Oh, and did I mention it can even handle CRAZY winds? This thing is a total beast. Last thing: I recommend buying an extra 2 chargers and charging station. Instead of getting 31 mins of flight time, you can get 1.5 hours of it with three batteries. It makes a big difference.Long story short, if you’re on the fence, don’t be. Just buy it—you won’t regret it."
"Already own a sub 250 gram drone with a 4K camera and 3-axis gimble so...Did extensive research prior to purchasing the DJI Neo by reading/watching lots of reviews. After a few days toying with it, I am 110% sold. Nope by no means is it perfect yet IMHO, the positive far outweigh the negatives.Build quality is first rate in my opinion so should stand up fairly well. Props are well protected, battery latches firmly into place, has a camera guard/cover, power and mode control buttons are top mounted, has voice prompts, available in a ""Fly More Combo"" kit, etc.Super small footprint yet packs a punch. Multifunction in that it can be flown w/o a phone or RC controller, with a mobile phone, and/or with the DJI RC-N3 remote controller. Has palm takeoff and landing, voice control, AI subject tracking and quickshots, etc. Compared to other drones equipped with a single axis gimble, DJI stabilization technology really does a great job in keeping the footage smooth. I've gotten between 11-13 minutes of battery runtime so we are OK with that.My only real complaint(s) would have to be the limited onboard (non-removable/upgradable) storage. Although 22GB seems fairly ample so far it is an odd choice for such a device... To download footage requires plugging the drone into a device, no battery/power-on needed."

Okay let me start out with the stuff I don’t like. There’s not much…I don’t like how it doesn’t have rear obstacle avoidance. I wish it went just a little faster/more power for better air control. I also wish it had an adjustable aperture. Wish the EXP’s for yaw were lower and more yaw range in the gimbal. Wish it had slightly more dynamic range too.Okay now what I do like!Coming from an Inspire 2 with X5s, the size is the biggest advantage overall. The fact it folds down so small is amazing. No longer needing to carry around a 50lb pelican case for my drone is quite convenient lol. The Air 2S is much more low key and quiet for “sketchy” quick flights or through tight obstacles. Plus, the Air 2S shoots higher resolution than the Inspire. Yes, given it’s not Cinema DNG RAW, but the D-Log and 10-Bit H.265 files from the Air 2S are very workable (Especially with the new Mac M1 processors). It has maybe 12.5-13 stops dynamic range from my eye and color grading tests in Resolve. As for color grading the footage, the shadow recovery is much better than highlight recovery so try and always expose your image for the highlights as they cannot be recovered nearly as much in post. The files are a good bitrate 5.4K 24fps 10-Bit, meaning you have the resolution to zoom in without loss and they have better color tonality. The colors can be a little strange especially blue midtone shadows. Fixable in post though.You just have to understand how amazing it is to have a camera that you can put virtually anywhere in the air with a detailed 5.4K video. With three batteries charging you can get a lot of flights in one day with this guy, maximizing your opportunities for creative shots in many different locations. The size of the drone is amazing. Like legit the size of a large camera lens. The controller also fits nicely as the thumb sticks come off and store in it making it more flat. Also, the controllers battery life is just simply amazing. It lasts forever. The bag the drone comes with is extremely nice and great if you are just doing a trip with it. Everything fits in there. The included ND filters are very nice and honestly required for most flights. No noticeable color shift on the filters and they balance on the gimbal perfectly. I did order myself some additional CPL filters that helped quite a bit when shooting water and such. You may need something darker than ND32 for mid day shooting FYI.Battery life is roughly 20 mins of spirited flying while still leaving plenty reserve and not letting them go below 20% to extend their life. Plenty for some fun hyperlapses, which is an awesome included feature. The master shots feature (will the drone will fly itself and get some base level shots) is good to just do as a base level and completes in a couple mins. Results are good for zero effort.Finally, the range on it is superb. 9/10 situations it will have no problems. Staying within line of sight keeps signal the best (and legal). Flying behind objects will sometimes lose the connection. Also in cities (areas with lots of wifi signals) it has less range. But I would say it has better signal than the Inspire 2. The Inspire 2 was more “nimble” and “smooth” given the better power envelope of the motors, 360 spin of the gimbal, and second operator all adding to smoother footage of hard to track items, but could not go nearly as far. With the Air 2S line of sight becomes a TINY speck on the horizon.For a single man band this drone is only beaten by the Mavic 3, which is several times the price ($5k for the good “cinema” version). In my 10+ years of videography I haven’t been this stoked on a new tool in a while and it will be used a lot when the bigger cinema drones cannot fly or are not practical.Okay let’s compare the drones I have flown/used: Mavic Air 2S ($1000) vs Mavic Air ($500) vs Phantom 4 Pro ($1600) vs Inspire 2 X5S ($10,000) vs Freefly Alta 8 RED Monstro Zeiss CP3 ($175,000)When I compared the top dogs like an Inspire and a flying cinema camera (Alta 8), the Air 2S surprisingly holds its strengths pretty well. They are different tools for different jobs and are not apples to apples AT ALL but the fact the Air 2S and everything in the bag is about the same size as the MoVI (Alta 8’s Gimbal) Controller is kind of funny.The image quality on the Air 2S is much better than the Mavic Air and the P4P both in resolution and dynamic range. The resolution is comparable to the X5S camera but the dynamic range of the Air 2S is noticeably worse than the X5S. Obviously, if you are shooting something with budget and need 8K with good lenses, the Alta is your best bet. But that is 2 huge 80lb boxes, has a 10 min flight time at 45lbs with massive batteries. Minimum of 2 operators. Whole different beast. Can’t really compare the Alta to the Air 2S.If you’re into travel vlogging, weddings, real estate, landscape this is the perfect drone if you can’t quite stretch to get the Mavic 3.Also to compare this to the “48mp” Mavic Air 2, the pictures are actually much sharper because of the 1 inch sensor and better lens. Plus the Air 2 is a 12MP camera with pixel shift it’s marketing talk. Megapixels are not everything and the true 20 MP of the Air 2S will be enough for most uses I think.Also note 4K 60 has a crop where 5.4K does not. Can be pretty useful actually IMO.Amazing where technology is going and excited to see when the Mavic line comes out with interchangeable lenses someday! Great product DJI!Included is a video I made along the California Coast with exclusively the Mavic Air 2S and the included ND filters. Enjoy!"
"*UPDATED BELOW*Bought the DJI Mavic Air 2, two weeks ago before I knew an update was coming so soon buttt.... I just ordered the Air 2S! The Air 2 has been fantastic but I did run into some range issues or losing connectivity around buildings and residential areas. Hoping the updated unit with 4 antennas vs 2 will fix that issue. Also looking forward to the updated hardware and 1 inch sensor! Will post back with comparison and if it was worth the extra buy.*UPDATE*So today I just got the beautifully upgraded 2S only  two weeks after purchasing the Air 2. What are my first look and flight opinions... 100% worth the upgrade! Now don’t get me wrong the Air 2 is still an amazing drone and will work great for anyone but for me as I had the money and interest in learning how to edit video footage this upgrade was well worth it. Just look at the difference in the cameras in my pictures...  Air2S - aluminum or metal material gimbal and has a beautiful 1” sensor vs Air2 - .5” plastic sensor and tbh the picture on the Air2S is just flat out better. However the Air 2 is still a fully capable drone and I will still use it as my everyday drone and for riskier shots.As for the OcuSync 3.0 or better know as O3 I didn’t see a huge improvement on my first flight and I live in a suburb area with no tall buildings. That doesn’t mean that the range won’t be better for some but in my impression I saw no improvement here. I do have out of ground power lines all over where I live so this could be causing the issue. It generally lost signal when I was about .25 miles away and was flying low but would regain signal going above 65 feet. Not a huge deal breaker for me and I know others have said they saw a big improvement so maybe it’s the specific area where I live.Lastly, MASTER SHOTS! This is one of the coolest things about the drone IMO. You select your target and the Air2S shoots a sequence of really cool dynamic shots and throws them into an edit for you. It literally does everything for you and it comes out really cool if you want to impress your friends or social media followers.All in all 100% BUY THIS DRONE if it fits your budget. I don’t think it is too far off the price of the Air2 so if you have the extra cash I would definitely spend a little extra and go with the Air2S. In my opinion - Always go with the Fly More Combo - I got it on both drones."
"This purchase completes my DJI family. The Mavic Air 2s was the only model that I didn't have. I spent months agonizing whether I should buy it. But, a few advantages to the newest 2s FMC (fly more combo) finally tipped the scale.With the improvements to the OAS, autonomous flight programs and enhanced image quality, I just could not say 'no' to the Air 2s. And, who buys just the drone basic package, just to struggle with getting the additional accessories one by one later on? I'd rather just get what I need now and get it over with, as the FMC. Then, pick up the few accessories that I know I will need to round out the set.The Air 2s is on par with the rest of the DJI aircraft for performance and reliability. It's very easy to fly. It interfaces with your smart phone very smoothly. The controls are straightforward and simple to understand and operate. It's larger than the Mini, smaller than the M2P and right in the middle, price wise.The complications of adhering to FAA regulations and licensing have been simplified with built in and available software. The most basic things to remember right now are that, as a recreational flyer, you need to register with the FAA and display your registration number on all of your aircraft. BTW, as a recreational flyer, you only need to register once, as a pilot, and YOUR number is what's displayed on the drone. Each aircraft does NOT need to be registered. That is with the pilots that want to fly for profit.Because the Air 2s is heavier that 250g, your number has to be applied to this drone, in an obvious place on the exterior of the drone. I recommend using a label maker to do the FAA number and your cell phone number.The Air 2s is a great aircraft and like all of my DJI aircraft, it gets 5 stars."
"I currently have a Phantom 3 Pro, an Air 2 and Air2S. Both the Air 2 and the Air2S are great drones to fly. I prefer the Air 2S due to the fact that it has a better camera. I am using this with the Smart Controller as the iphone screens are not bright enough for sunny days. Love the drone and love the controller!"
"The Dji Air 2s is a masterpiece of engineering. Keep in mind this is my first major drone purchase. I'm completely ametuer. These drones have laws and regulations surrounding them. Please find your local laws and regulations. I had to register mine through transport Canada and even pass a test to obtain a basic drone pilot's license. Enough about that shit. This drone out of box runs spectacular. I would recommend buying the blade guards, they add a little weight but give good protection. My first run with it was at my local campsite I own and the nearest lake. You can use this to take amazing videos as well. They are so many options and modes that its impossible to use the all. My first run with this drone was brief, I used it then put it away to read up on heights in the local area. I then used it at a local creek, I was flying far and over swampy lands. Well it lost connection. I thought I just lost my drone. But it will stop where connection was lost and attempt to require signal. It will then return to home. Amazing. The whole reason I wrote this post was because I literally just ran into the side of a pine tree. I was night flying and assumed the sensors would kick in but I guess they don't work at night. The drone then fell approx 10 ft into the ground. That was it I thought. I'm an idiot for night flying in and enclosed area. I walked over to the drone. Visually inspected it. The gimbal Camera was overloaded. But the drone itself was folded up. Apparently they told up when something like this happens. The drone was still in perfect condition. A quick restart fixed the overloaded gimbal . I would highly recommend this drone to anyone."
Greatest thing ever !!
"Very controllable in all 3 flight modes. Very steady and sensitive movements in Cine mode, Normal mode drone responds quicker and flies faster, Sport mode it really moves! I intentionally tested it on a windy day to see how it handled and it is impressive. The drone handled the winds very well for being a mini and took amazingly steady pictures without blurring in the wind. Both the drone and the controller are well made and modern looking. The controller paired easily and quickly to the drone and my Android phone. The app has many features also. The case is fantastic the way the top opens and all parts fit into a secure spot with much easier access than the usual shoulder bags they come with. The SE is a great drone for the money and it was delivered by Amazon very quickly also. Thanks Bewine for making a great product at a reasonable price!"

From the moment I opened the box, I knew I had purchased a quality product. The presentation was excellent, with a case that, for a budget drone, feels very well made and adds great value to the package. The compact fabric of the case is of high quality and its design, with a practical handle, allows the drone to be easily carried anywhere without fear of damaging it.Upon opening the case, I found a lightweight but well-built drone, with materials that, although simple, do not feel low quality. The battery also surprised me, as it reaches almost the flight time specified in the description, allowing for plenty of time in the air to capture photos and videos.As for the camera, for a starter drone, it produces good quality images and videos. Even on a windy day, I was able to control it without problems and take sharp photos. The sunlight affected the quality a little, but in my case this was due to the smoke in the environment, something specific. Despite that, the flight and photography experience has been incredible and different.I recommend this drone to those looking for an affordable option without compromising too much on quality. It's perfect if you want to experience it without investing in an expensive drone that would probably offer you similar performance. So far, I haven't found any drawbacks and will continue to update if anything comes up. Overall, it's an excellent purchase."
"This drone was advertised as a cheaper alternative to drones costing hundreds - the reality is it's still a fairly expensive drone that has limited battery life, limited operating range and some communications glitches. On the negative side:The battery life is only about 10 minutes per pack. - there is an approximately 25% capacity reserve which is basically unusable since the drone will only allow return-to-start flight when the battery shows 2 of four bars.The operating range is only approximately 150' before the unit starts glitching and the communication starts freezing for periods of time. If you exceed this range, the chances are good that the drone will become uncontrollable until you walk closer. Any obstructions to line-of-sight will result in signal loss (think about your home wifi).The camera is very high def, but there is no gimbal so the images are very shaky. You can control the angle of the camera on one axis but requires bringing up an on-screen toggle.The positives:The GPS system seems very good - it will return to an area within a few feet of take-off. It is easy to calibrate and it has an on-screen indicator of location relative to the base. The auto return works reasonably well.The camera is very crisp and clear.The drone is easy to learn to operate even for a beginner, and the stabilization software works OK for low-wind days (<5-10 mph).Overall this drone is a decent, low-cost system but the price is a little high for the features provided, in my opinion. Limited range is the biggest disappointment."

The customer service was top-notch, making the whole experience smooth and hassle-free. This remote controller works flawlessly with my Mavic 3 and Air 2S drones, enhancing my flying experience with its precision and ease of use. If you’re in the market for a reliable remote with excellent support and quick delivery, this one is definitely worth it. Highly recommended for anyone looking to elevate their drone experience!”"
"I wasn’t going to write a review however, I’m compelled to write something since I wasn’t expecting much as I upgraded from my Mavic 2 Pro / Smart Controller set up to the Mavic 3 / RC set up.  I honestly didn’t have many problems with the original controller and would have kept it if it were compatible with the Mavic 3.  The RC is an improvement in ways I didn’t think of and some of the “downgrades” from the original aren’t affecting me like I thought it would.**UPGRADES****Weight / Handling**This is the first thing that stood out to me.  I didn’t think the original was heavy at all however, compared to the RC, I’m noticing I’m not as fatigued after flying for around 2.5 hours.  Also, for it being lighter in weight, the grip feels MUCH better than the original. The RC also feels stronger and could survive an accidental drop a couple times.  The original felt like it would get destroyed from 1 accidental drop.**Speed**The RC is MUCH faster than the original in almost every aspect.  From turning on the controller, to booting up the app and connecting with my Drone.  Very impressed since this is an unexpected improvement over the original.  Touch operations are also as smooth as the original.**Price**The fact this controller is $309 at launch compared to $649 for the original at launch, it makes it that much harder to justify paying $1199 for the RC Pro.  I haven’t used the RC Pro however, until I get some clients that would help me justify that price, I’m totally happy with the RC.**Battery Life**Now that I’m writing this review, the one criticism I had of the original was the battery life.  Mine only lasted 2 hours and I’d have to connect it an external battery if I wanted to fly my Mavic 2 Pro and/or Air 2s for more than 3 batteries.  With the RC, I was able to fly for 2.5 hours with my Mavic 3 and still had 50% power left.  Also, when both the original and RC are connected to PD chargers, it seems the RC charges faster than the original.  I haven’t tested this extensively, but it’s something I’m noticing.**Signal Strength**I’m not noticing any difference between using the Mavic 2 Pro (or Air 2s) / w Smart Controller vs using the Mavic 3 with the DJI RC.  I didn’t have any problems with the original in this regard so, the RC is good to go for me.  This for me is impressive seeing the RC’s antennas are inside the controller vs the original had external antennas.  For me, I don’t have to worry as much about breaking the antennas with the RC in case of an accidental drop.**""DOWNGRADES""****Screen Brightness**To be honest, I’m not noticing much of a difference between the 700 nits of the RC compared to the 1000 nits of the original.  I was able to compare them side by side and only noticed the difference when looking at them directly.  One thing that somewhat annoyed me with the original was the fact I would still need to stand in the shade sometimes during the day.  The difference in nits doesn’t change this at all for my needs. For a summer in Utah, all I need to do is operate the controller in my own shadow and I’m good.  That’s also what I had to do when I lived in Texas while using the original smart controller.  I never thought I needed a sunshade with the original and at this time, I don’t need one with the RC.  Plus, the difference in brightness is NOT a game changer for me either way.**No Way to Install Custom Apps**I had a few custom apps on the original Smart Controller but ended up never using them.  This is not an issue for me with the RC and I still have my RC-N1 in case I need to use a tablet with other apps.  I also don’t care about the downgrade in screen recording quality.  I did like navigating thru the android OS in the original but, I’ll be fine without that option in the RC.**HDMI Out**This is the only downgrade that stings a bit with me.  I’ve used HDMI out a few times with the original and loved the fact my clients could see what I’m doing.  Since it’s been a while since I had a client with that need, plus with other financial obligations, I had a hard time justifying a $900 increase for the RC Pro at this time.  When I have a client with that need, I’ll have no problem getting the RC Pro, but I’ll keep the RC for everyday use.  Who knows, DJI might enable a USB-C to HDMI output option in the future for the RC.**Dual Operators**This is a feature I’d like to see added to the Mavic 3 in the future.  The Mavic 2 Pro had this feature and it would be nice to use the new RC controllers in this way.**Lack of Buttons Compared to Original**This was something I thought would bother me but, DJI has you covered.  The original has a 5D button I often used to control the exposure however, with the RC, I'm fine with using the touch screen.  You can also hold one of the C buttons behind the controller, then use one of the control wheels above the controller to adjust the exposure.  Something I can get used to, but nothing to complain about.**OVERVIEW**I was on the fence for a long time about upgrading my Mavic 2 Pro to the Mavic 3 due to how expensive the upgrade would be, especially with the early issues with the Mavic 3.  I also couldn’t afford the RC Pro.  When I crashed my Mavic 2 Pro, I was forced to move forward with the Mavic 3 and the RC-N1.  Once the RC became compatible with the Mavic 3, I felt like my Mavic 3 experience was complete, especially with the Mavic 3 issues being corrected in firmware.  Once you use any smart controller, It’s hard going back to using your smartphone / tablet when flying your drone and I’m very happy and relieved with the performance of the DJI RC.  I think DJI should bundle the RC with the Mavic 3 Fly More Combo by default, but I’m glad it’s finally compatible with the Air 2s."
"Great having the clear, bright built-in screen. Battery time is really good."
"> Setup is simple. Just follow the instructions and answer the questions.> Had to update the firmware on both my controller and my drone first, but it was all automatic.> My MINI 3 is less than 250g so no government registration was needed.> I am five miles from an air force base so I agreed to fly at altitudes under 400 feet. Not an issue.> The screen is clear and bright enough to see in sunlight.> Controls are very responsive in all directions.> Has more physical control knobs than the controller using my phone.> The battery in the controller lasts long enough that you can make multiple flights without recharging.> Cannot use third party apps like you can on your phone but I bought it to free my phone from flight duty.> Three flight modes to match video capture needs, normal flights, and full speed flights.> Highly recommended as a new drone pilot."
"This RC was an excellent purchase with wonderful functionality.  However, not even a year into ownership it started draining its batteries rapidly.  I could barely get through one flight of my Air2S before the batteries were almost exhausted.I upgraded to an RC Pro and sent the RC to DJI for repair.  They investigated and discovered that the board had an issue and it was out of warranty so they replaced the entire unit with a new one...and charged me $220.Obviously this was most likely an issue with this individual unit and not a reflection on all other DJI RC units and products which are of outstanding quality.  Im sharing this just in case anyone else has similar battery issues."
Necessary upgrade for flying a DJI drone. The screen quality is superb and so is the battery life. Have used this for volunteer search and rescue and more regular video uses while at home or traveling. The only downside is transferring files to the phone to share them when working and time is of the essence. I transfer the video/image from the controller to the phone to the laptop to a shared folder for review and syncing with maps and whatnot. There may be a faster way that I do not know. I still recommend this controller 100%. I only wish I could afford the even more superb controller and an even better drone from DJI.
"This one has stronger signal than control by cell phone, big screen has a clear view and easy to reach all function"
Very handy great screen. Much easier to use

First up - my drone flying experience was one failed flight on a cheap drone 3 years ago which put me off trying a more expensive one. Big mistake.Thankfully this DJI Mini 4K was on a Prime deal so I took a chance. 1 million percent happy I did. My passion is making videos of nature and local events. I use good quality equipment and wanted something that could enhance my videos but not look cheap. I watched some YouTube videos on the DJI Mini 2 (and 4K - basically the same drone) and took a chance.REVIEW:1. Ridiculously easy to fly. No crashes, no near misses and no chance it will fly away. All of which I had in the first day using the afore mentioned cheap drone. This DJI takes off and just hovers there - no moving, no drifting. You push up on the left stick and it goes up. You pull down on the left stick it comes down and lands. It's that easy. First flight I even landed it on my hand because the grass was a bit long. (I have bought a landing mat)2. Safe - following on from easy to fly is safety. The built in return to home features mean this drone is next to impossible to lose. Yes, you could fly it into a tree or building, but because you see what the camera see and you have accurate height information would mean it's your fault - not the drones. I have taken things slow and so far I have done some fairly long distance flights (400ft high and almost a mile away). If I lose sight of the drone, I use the map on the screen to line it up with me and fly it back. If I really get stuck I press the Return To Home and it flys itself back and lands.3. Video quality - beautiful. The image is incredibly stable (as you would expect from DJI), the picture quality is excellent and compliments my other equipment. This little drone is punching way above its weight. And again, because you have live video feedback in your hands getting reasonable composed shots in the first week is possible. See attached video. It's a learning curve for sure, but using any new video camera is. The skill is not having the $ to but the equipment, but learning to use it properly. The cheap drone I tried 3 years ago was unusable video - shaky, soft, washed out colors. This DJI is fantastic in auto mode, and in manual mode you have some control over the recording settings. And because it is so stable in flight, you can concentrate on making sure the video you are recording is good - you are not worrying that the drone will crash.4. Value - I paid $239 on Prime deal day. What a steal. The build quality is excellent. The IOS App is easy to use. No issues connecting, no stability issues, not bugs found. Flight time is about 20 - 25 minutes, which is more than enough for what I need.5. Extras - Technically everything you need, apart from a Micro SD card,  is in the basic package. You don't need to buy anything else. But some nice to have extras, that I have now bought are : More batteries - I bought the 2 batteries and charger (renewed) pack for $88. I also bought a protection case $20, a landing mat $18, a screen shield to help with bright sunlight viewing $20. I am also using Freewell ND filters, so far I have bought 4 of them $60. But technically all of these are not needed. But my advise would be to get the flymore pack if you have the budget - it makes a saving - but for me on the Prime day deal it was not an option, only the basic kit was reduced.Summary: I love this little drone. It has given me the confidence to get out there and fly. Its easy to fly, the video is great and the value its excellent. I was scarred by a cheap drone experience. The motto ""buy cheap, buy twice"" has never been more true. I could not recommend this product any higher. If you are a complete beginner then this is the place to start."
"As a newcomer to the world of drones, I could not decide between Holy Stone HS900 and the DJI Mini 4K. So I decided to do what any reasonable adult does that has expendable income, I bought both...lol. Here’s a detailed comparison based on my experiences with both models.Holy Stone HS900Pros:Ease of Use: The HS900 is incredibly user-friendly, making it a great choice for beginners. The controls are intuitive, and it is easy to get it up and flying right out of the box.Photography: The drone takes good quality pictures, which is impressive for its price range. The camera captures clear and sharp images that are suitable for casual photography.Cons:Range: One major downside I noticed is that the HS900 does not live up to its advertised range. The actual operational range is considerably shorter, which can be disappointing if you’re looking to explore or cover larger areas.Video Transmission: While the photos are good, the video transmission quality doesn’t match up to higher-end models. There is noticeable lag and occasional signal loss, which can be frustrating during flights.DJI Mini 4KPros:Range: The Mini 4K excels in this department. Its range is significantly better than the HS900, allowing for extended flights and greater exploration without worrying about losing connection.Video Transmission: The video quality on the Mini 4K is outstanding. It provides a clear and stable feed, making it ideal for capturing high-quality footage and ensuring smooth operation during flights.Overall Value: Considering the features and performance, the DJI Mini 4K offers exceptional value for its price. It stands out as the clear winner in terms of both range and video quality.ConclusionFor someone new to drones like myself, both the Holy Stone HS900 and the DJI Mini 4K have their merits. The HS900 is a good starter drone, particularly for photography and ease of use. However, if you’re looking for a drone that offers better range, superior video transmission, and overall higher performance, the DJI Mini 4K is the clear winner."
"After trying one of the Holy Stone drones thinking I would save a few bucks since I only need a drone for one specific purpose, but being disappointed with the video quality of it, I returned it and bought the DJI Mini 4K.  Let me tell you, this blew me out of the water.The remote comes pre-connected to the drone, and when you plug the remote into your phone, it automatically brings up the DJI Fly app and you're instantly ready to fly.  No calibration needed, no settings to change, just press the button and go.Video quality is amazing and on par with the $1000+ drones DJI makes.  Zero jitters, movement is super smooth and the gimbal does a great job stabilizing the shots.  The built-in ""quickshots"" are incredible and super easy to use.  This was a big problem I had with the Holy Stone drone I tried, the preset flight paths didn't work as expected.  With the Mini 4k, you press one button, tap on the part of the image you want it focus on on the screen, and off it goes circling, spiraling, or whatever else you tell it to do around the object you selected.  Only downside is it doesn't seem to be able to do a continuous circle - once it does 360 degrees, it stops recording.  There may be a fix for this but if so, I haven't found it yet.  But it's really a minor inconvenience.I got about 25 minutes of flight time on a single fully charged battery, and I have an extra battery and charger on the way.  I wish it included a case, but I bought one for $20 on Amazon so that solves that.I would recommend this drone to anyone who doesn't need ultra-advanced features that you'd find on the $1000 drones."
This is my third mini 2 I like them but one word of advice when buying used from anyone or from Amazon make sure to download app and view your profile in there make sure it is not bound to another persons email if so call DJI and they will help you out to fix it.The build is great and very durable except if you hit a tree  very fun and easy  I would recommend starting off on normal not sport  until you figure out how fast and how long it takes to stop and move  but it is really fun and can go very far
"This drone takes lovely 1080p video and ok 4k video.It lacks object tracking, apart from the quick shots features, so you have to aim the camera(and therefore the drone) manually.It doesn't have waypoints so you cannot set a path for the drone to follow.It is a good quality drone, easy to use and take nice images, but without the tracking feature, I am a little disappointed with it.The other drone companies include such features at this price point, so perhaps shop around?Good delivery times and tracking, thanks Amazon :)"
"I’m a beginner, the camera quality is amazing and it is easy to operate.Very steady in the air and definitely more than I expected for the price.The only downside is the battery life. I would definitely recommend getting additional batteries if you plan on flying for more than 20-30 minutes at a time."
Works with Drone as advertised
"First thing was started up here we go 30064 error code. It hooked up easy once I got my in pair mode . The distance from the controller is lot shorter,can’t go as far as my original controller."
Works great love it
This controller was nothing but aggravating for me. It wouldn't connect to internet and it wouldn't let me log in to my DJI account which really limits your flight to a baseballs throw distance away. You'd think that for this amount of money it would be flawless but I had to jump through so many hoops to try and get it to work that finally it wasn't worth it. So I returned it AND I had to pay for shipping for their bum product!
"As I have said before, I really wish DJI was an American Company. Their Products are far and above anything all of the US Drone makers (not many are there?) can match. Build quality, sturdiness and durability in all sorts of weather is unmatched.In the vast cosmos of drone technology, the DJI Mavic 3 Pro Cine Drone shines like a supernova, illuminating the path for aerial cinematography. From the moment I unboxed this aerial marvel, I knew I was in for an unparalleled flying experience.Stunning Image Quality: The Mavic 3 Pro Cine doesn't just capture moments; it immortalizes them in breathtaking clarity. The image quality is nothing short of spectacular, making every frame worthy of the big screen. Whether I'm capturing the serene beauty of a sunrise or the intricate patterns of a bustling city, the results are consistently awe-inspiring. It's like having a Hollywood-grade camera that soars!Impressive Specs: This drone is a testament to DJI's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology. With its advanced obstacle sensors, the Mavic 3 Pro Cine navigates the skies with the grace and precision of a ballet dancer. The Hasselblad camera, with its impeccable resolution and color accuracy, ensures that every shot is a masterpiece. And let's not forget the impressive transmission range, allowing for expansive exploration without compromise.Extended Flight Time: The Mavic 3 Pro Cine isn't just a sprinter; it's a marathon runner. The extended flight time means I can stay airborne longer, capturing extended sequences and exploring vast landscapes without the constant worry of battery drain. It's truly liberating to know that time is on my side as I navigate the skies.The DJI Mavic 3 Pro Cine Drone isn't just a purchase; it's an investment in unparalleled aerial cinematography. It's a fusion of cutting-edge technology and artistic prowess, all packed into a sleek, compact design. For those looking to elevate their filming game and soar to new cinematic heights, this drone is the ultimate co-pilot. Here's to many more flights filled with breathtaking visuals and boundless exploration!"
"I purchased this drone as an upgrade from my mini 4 pro. Wow what a difference!The zoom is incredible, today I took pictures 400ft up and zoomed in max and could make out items 25 miles away. It may not have been super high quality due to the time of day and the haze from out high humidity but it still blows my mind.The main camera is where the money is. The clarity and detail of it brings everything to a new detail. The higher resolution of my video allows me to still crop without needing to drop far below 4k.I have yet to see this quality. I still am a little nervous to test it's flying ability but I can see this being used as my main drone. Only using my mini for the low altitude following. I can not recommend this more."
"This is a great drone for existing drone flyers to move up to.  I moved up from my DJI Mini 3 Pro drone so I already knew the basics of flying and drone videos.  I would not recommend this for first time drone pilots.  The Hasselblad camera with three lenses is spectacular with both auto and pro (manual) settings.  The photo quality is incredible.  The controller is the top of the line with a crystal clear screen and various customization options. Best of all this is a professional  level aircraft with way too many options to list.  For me one of the highlights is the ability to pre-program flights so complicated maneuvers are handled by the software and are always perfect.  With the three intelligent batteries you have about two hours of flying time.  Charging is a bit slow so always start with the batteries fully charged.  I added a polarizing filter, a two level carrying case and a second, faster, battery charger so I'll have one at home and one in my carrying case at all times. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny."
"After roughly a month or less of purchasing a brand new DJI Mavic 3 Pro Cine, I now have been fighting back and forth for weeks for DJI to honor their POS equipment. As an extensive DJI Prosumer, this was not what I expected of not just the product, but even worse the support from DJI.On a clear day just a few weeks ago, I was flying this drone for a project of mine in Florida. Within the first 3 minutes of the flight, I had the RC Pro in my hand sitting on my palm with the right side gripped with zero hands or fingers on any buttons or joysticks, Mavic 3 hovering.I went to take a seat on the tailgate of my truck to better face the drone as I like to face the flight path and make sure I have total visual in my peripheral too. Well during the 7, maybe 9, or 10-second max it took to move from the front seat to the tailgate, I looked down to see my RC controller screen black, prompting no connection to the drone. Confused, I pressed Home to hopefully still have some sort of connection or control and I could get the drone back to me.It did nothing, and I'm now a little concerned because it's prompting a ton of alerts and I have no idea where it is, the drone was never to be seen or connected again. Confused and worried, I walked over to where I recall it last hovering, praying it was still there or just landed right where it was, I never located the drone, until 3 hours later after canvassing a 500ydx500yd grid of the area to find the drone just 130 ish yards from that location, completely destroyed.After opening a case on the drone and the incident that had occurred, DJI conveniently cannot and refuses to address or answer why and/or how it would propel itself forward while not being instructed to by the operator as I had zero body contact to the joysticks, continuing to avoid that, they keep stating it was a pilot error.Instead, they keep telling me that it's a pilot error and continuously keep routing me to a different person of contact, and they refuse to address why it did this.Sadly, my creative team uses a heavy amount of DJI products, and we will replace them with a brand that offers their prosumers more accurate support. I highly recommend you AVOID this organization and keep your money elsewhere."
Best quality and tech in a drone. This thing is amazing.
"Camera is great resolution. Easy to fly, fun to use. You must be cognisant of regulations where you can and cannot fly. Battery life is pretty good, but considering how much fun it is to use, spare batteries are a strong recommendation (and they are not inexpensive). If I somehow crash it and break it, I sure will try again!"
I bought this for the better camera and it doesn't disappoint. The zoom and picture quality is amazing especially compared to the mini series. Expensive but worth every penny
"I tried it and is awesome, unfortunately, I cant afford it for now, and lets say there are other reasons just to be safe. I wish I could buy this."
"easy to fly,gets better with time"
"I had flown FPV years ago when you had to build your own. Flying/racing got tiresome keeping it all working together and then rebuilding after a crash. The learning curve was very high. This drone makes it so ANYONE can fly FPV. Use the simulator or stay in 'beginner' mode at first and your family can fly with you. The drone is pretty tough but I really recommend the DJI Care Refresh. And as of this month (June 2024) the drones no longer sync to DJI, your data is your data. Just sayin"
It is as described and fit everything I have for my drone perfectly. Strong sturdy and holds shut. What else do I need.
Love the fit and protection for my DJI Air 2.  The only negative is that I wish it was cut out to leave the joysticks in the controller while storing.
"I choose this case for the quality, size and price.  From picture, it looks solid to me.  As i received it, it is a very well built case.  The size is just right, not too big, easy to carry around, although i hope a mesh pocket inside would be more helpful."
"I've had this case for about 2 months and took it on a road trip. Verdict: it's awesome!The exterior is very sturdy — enough to toss around without worry. But what I'm most impressed with is the foam inside. It's super dense and seems super high quality.The size of the container is perfect. It's big enough to store all your peripherals, yet small enough to take anywhere. I even threw the whole thing inside my backpack to take it hiking, without it feeling cumbersome.If you're looking for a high quality case for an affordable price, this is the one!"
Product is high quality and as advertised. Recommended
"I purchased this case hoping it would be a durable and waterproof option for my kayak adventures. The build quality is good — it's incredibly sturdy and feels like it could withstand quite a bit of wear and tear. The latches snap securely, and the materials feel durable enough for long-term use.One downside is that this case does not live up to its waterproof claims. After submerging it in water for a short period, I noticed water made its way inside. This was quite disappointing since I specifically wanted something that could handle full submersion. It seems to work fine for light rain or splashes, but if you're planning on taking it into water or trusting it in extreme wet conditions, I wouldn’t.  I returned it for another one, but it had the same problem.For most other uses, it's great. It’s ideal for keeping things safe from dirt, dust, and general outdoor conditions. For daily use or even travel where you don’t expect to fully submerge it, this case will do the job well. Since I wanted it purely for being waterproof.  I have returned them both and will be looking elsewhere."
