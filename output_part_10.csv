"Starting off with the Anker 7-in-1 USB C Hub, it's clear this little device is designed to offer a wide range of connectivity options in a sleek, compact design. With 4K HDMI output and 100W Power Delivery, this hub sets itself apart in a sea of adapters.The build quality is solid; it feels like it's made to last. I've purchased several of these hubs, mainly because they work great as Samsung DeX docks for my kids' phones, and they're handy to have in my bag for travel. One of the features I've found particularly useful is the SD Card slot ‚Äì it's a breeze transferring photos and videos between devices, be it my phone, camera, or laptop. I'm always on the go, and this hub simplifies that process immensely.However, there's one hiccup that I encountered. Although it boasts 100W Power Delivery, I've faced some challenges in finding a suitable power source to deliver that capacity to the hub, this was a problem with a MacBook Pro, HP Spectre 360 and a Dell XPS.  It's not a deal-breaker, but something to be mindful of if you're planning to use it more as a small ""dock"" instead of a portable travel hub.The Anker 7-in-1 USB C Hub offers fantastic value and versatility. It might have its quirks, but its positives certainly outweigh the negatives. I genuinely hope this review gives you some insights, and thanks for stopping by!"
This works perfectly and lasts. The hub has all the connections I need to connect devices and power simultaneously with my iPad.
"I love Anker so much. They provide the best quality and fast charging. The adapter feels a bit light, giving the impression it is a bit cheap. However, the quality is great. I needed to project what was on my MacBook to quite a large TV and I didn‚Äôt notice any screen quality difference. If you are using sound for playing a video, make sure you connect the sound to the TV as well so it sinks up.1. Go to system settings2. Click on Displays3. Select your TV or Projector4. Select Mirror Your Screen if you want to see everything on your MacBookNote, it doesn‚Äôt work the other way around, you can‚Äôt receive input on MacBook like using an Xbox, Nintendo, PS5, etc. All the ports are exactly what you will ever need period. Cord length is just right too. I hate it when they give you this huge cord and you don‚Äôt know what do to with it. This also connects to iPhones if you have usb-c. Typically iPhone 15 or newer. This adapter is really great and I really recommend. If this doesn‚Äôt work for you, I would look at other Anker adapters or go Ugreen. Ugree has really good adapters too."
"Bought this to use with my MacBook. It allows me to hook up a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It seems to work fine. No complaints at this point."

Build quality feels sturdy, and the sleek design complements any setup.Overall, the UGREEN USB C HUB is perfect if you‚Äôre looking for a reliable, all-in-one solution that performs flawlessly."
"Purchased this to replace my old anker hub that died, decided to try out UGreen because it was well reviewed and it certainly did not disappoint.Pass through power works great with my 65w charger, connects to my laptop, phone, and my legion go all perfectly fine. Does get warm but never too hot to touch.The ports are exactly what I needed, usb A, hdmi, and an sd reader. There is an option above this that has ethernet as well but I did not need this for my setup.Works great with no issues across my device, size is compact and easy to carry, speeds are great with usb and sd cards.Value is certainly there, comes at a great price."
Doesn't heat up as much as the other brand I bought in a store.  This gets a bit warm to the touch only. I feel better that this one can handle the transfers.

This is a great addition to increase functionality. My laptop has only one USB-A type port. I like to use a trackball mouse and full size keyboard. The printer cable needs someplace to insert too. This addition allows me to use all 3 because I used USB adaptors. At the price it is a bargain. I still have HDMI and card reader ports available.
The speed and ports are amazing. Only downside is drains batter little faster and heats up quickly.
"I have this for my macbook pro m1 and they work fantastically. Ironically, I ended up having to use this for the first time to try and retrieve dashcam footage after a crash (turns out I didn't have my dashcam pointing at the right place) but it works as intended, is just a little bulky. For the price, it's pretty hard to beat, and can plug your accessories and storage devices in as intended. Recommend as a buy, especially if it goes on sale for $16 or even less."
"Bought to use for transferring camera cards to SSD so I don't have to bring my laptop for travel jobs. I shoot 4K video on Lumix S5 and S1, and this is an absolute breeze to transfer files using the iPad as an intermediate device. I can connect my card reader, iPad, and USB-C charger to this hub all at the same time."
"The UGREEN USB C Hub 7-in-1 is a versatile and efficient addition to my tech setup. It provides 4K HDMI output, 100W power delivery, USB-C and two USB-A data ports, and SD/TF card readers, making it perfect for expanding connectivity on my MacBook Air and iPad Pro. The hub‚Äôs 5 Gbps data transfer speed is impressive, and the compact design ensures it‚Äôs easy to carry. It‚Äôs a reliable and multifunctional USB-C dongle for any device. Highly recommended for its comprehensive features and excellent performance!"

"I’m not the most tech savvy and wanted backup on an external drive for graphics heavy work and photos.  I remember the challenge of making my last external drive compatible and especially deleting old files, so I was a little anxious trying to find a solution.In case it helps someone else, I work primarily on an iPad Pro in a design program (Affinity) and needed a backup storage solution besides the Cloud.  I didn’t really want a second cloud solution to be backup and can’t use an external drive with the iPad.  I also have a MacBook, which has massive storage, but can’t be backed up to ICloud, while the ipad can backup to iCloud.  My workaround for immediate file saving is to create shared files which are stored on iCloud (I call them Desktop) on the ipad.  Desktop is stored on the hard drive of the MacBook and gets updated via ICloud device sharing even though I can’t initiate an iCloud backup from the MacBook.Inside Desktop I have labeled files as usual and a parent file for graphic design from the Ipad, broken down into 100+ named project files and sub files.  Whenever I save from the ipad, I save to Desktop (in iCloud) and then choose the appropriate file within Desktop to save.  This way I have the folders on the hard drive of the MacBook as interim backup, and am working around not having iCloud backup storage available when I’m on the MacBook.  The T7 comes in as secure and portable physical data storage.The T7 drive is the hard copy backup of the files shared between the iPad and MacBook, I think necessary in case of some dreadful software issue, fire, or other unanticipated loss of access.  I plan to have more than one as soon as I can afford it, to rotate.Again hopefully this may help someone like me who spent some solid hours figuring out a better way to secure my data and workaround the Mac user experience.Since I am wanted to do manual backups I needed the process to be easy so I wouldn’t avoid doing them, for obvious reasons.  Though we don’t need to get into it here I don’t want to use Time Machine on my Mac to back up the disk.  So I had to figure out something else.The T7 is great, easy to use, no time at all to install, self explanatory pretty much.  I dragged folders full of work from the desktop (yes I like to see them, don’t judge) to backup.  The initial backup was very quick and painless, most files were a few seconds.  The graphics heavy files perhaps took about 10 minutes?  These are massive, not a problem, and may have been quicker than this, I expected it to take more time.  (My last iCloud backup was over 13 hours of anxiety - I kid you not and have since deleted almost all the working files from the drawing app after saving them in Desktop so they happen more quickly now, but still, I thought this was a daylong project). I experimented with dragging an old file to the trash from the T7 disk pane, and it worked as expected.  I had to read online about how to go about copying my photos library (Mac) to disk, but it wasn’t hard.  I have over 40,000 images, and it took about 20 minutes as I recall, if longer probably max 25.  I tested the backup by remaining in the open pane and opening the photo files, which worked.  Amazingly all this data barely touches the capacity of the drive, maybe 10% or less of a TB?  Minuscule, anyway.  2 TB is overkill for me, especially since old files can easily be deleted.(This may be different for a user in Time Machine because it keeps multiple versions of your backups, and maybe more settings etc. which can take up a lot of space?-  not tech savvy, as I said, but I had trouble with my older system and Time Machine and being unable to delete backups which rendered my backup disk unusable, and I didn’t want to deal with this again even though it’s less convenient to do it manually).I think the T7 drive will fail before I need more space, which is a great problem to have.  I’m planning to get another disk (with less storage) and use it as a failsafe backup- ideally storing it in a safe or out of the house just in case, and keeping a rotation to protect against loss.On the critical end, I’d love it and think it would be much safer for data if the user pane of the T7 was visibly different from the one on my desktop.  It’s the same color, font, everything, as my desktop window (maybe that’s just how these things work?), which makes me triple check when I’m deleting or updating.  Don’t do this on a Friday night after an adult beverage….I’d also love it if there was a simple tutorial available when you opened the disk up, just for ease of first use, a how to  (experimented with a throwaway file deleting because it wasn’t obvious that dragging files to the trash would work) for most, and as a reminder for others.  I hesitate getting one for my parents because of this.  But I’m happy and will buy another, looking forward to the peace of mind it gives me."
"Great, quick upload and read speeds. Very small, comes with wires for both USB types, and tons of storage for a super cheap price."
"The Samsung T7 500GB Portable SSD in Grey is an absolute powerhouse, earning a solid five stars from me. Its lightning-fast speeds of up to 1050MB/s make transferring files a breeze, whether you're a student, professional, or avid gamer. Personally, I use it to store virtual machines, and let me tell you, it handles the task with ease. The sleek design and compact size make it highly portable, perfect for on-the-go use. Overall, if you're in need of speed, reliability, and ample storage capacity, this product is an excellent choice that won't disappoint."
"I got these to go into a couple of old, struggling laptops that I am using for Linux. I ended up using a USB SATA adapter to play around... and wow! They blew away my USB flash drives. I did put them in the laptops and they fit, work well and are faster than my old SATA SSDs. The 1TB is more than plenty for playing with Linux. The cost is very reasonable and they work well."
"Installed in an Acer Nitro 5 laptop as D drive for storage.  Excellent ssd, fast and easy install.  Highly recommended 👌"
Worked perfect. I used two to add as cache drives in a mirrored setup. Easy setup and they are fast enough for this purpose. My only complaint as with all of the drives on the market...would it kill them to include screws?? Either way I would buy again.
"I bought this drive to replace a very old HDD which had all of my music, photos and documents as a secondary drive on my computer.  I was going to get a Samsung, which is the brand I use for my primary drive, but it was significantly more expensive than this drive for the same size.  The comparable Samsung SSD is a bit faster, but for my secondary drive the difference in price made this a no-brainer for the large 2 Tb size.  Works just fine for my purpose and plenty fast enough compared to my old spinning hard drive."
Cost effective and from a trusted and reliable American brand. Micron is  a great company and though this is one of their lower end products I have no doubts it will last a long time.Performance is good but since this unit lacks DRAM it isn’t quite as fast as many of the higher end models but this is good basic drive
"Easy to clone old drive over to new SSD with free Acronis software you get online. Did have to get a SSD to usb cable to make the transfer happen.  Copying took about an hour to do. Once completed shut everything down opened up back of laptop. Mine had a removable panel over the hard drive and memory which made this pretty easy. Take out Two screws and gently pop the lid off. Old drive was right there.  Remove a couple of screws,  pulled old drive out. Had to remove the frame around old drive to install on new SSD.  Did this then mounted new SSD in frame put screws back for that then put the lid back on. This snaps in. You have to push pretty hard on some areas to get it to click in. Don’t forget the two screws that go with the lid.  My laptop was a Dell Inspiron with AMD 4 core processor and 8 gigs of memory.  Used to take forever to boot up and chrome felt like it would never open. Now this is not an issue anymore. Boots up fast and chrome almost pops right up when clicked on.  I think this is good investment to revive an old laptop to get more years out of it. Oh also upgraded OS to Win 11 although it was compatible. This seems to be working good as well. You can find videos on how to upgrade non compatible systems to windows 11 on you tube."
"This Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD is fantastic. I had a smaller Crucial external SSD that I used to store pictures and files, but I recently purchased a mini computer to travel with and wanted to increase the storage space and have 2 drives instead of just 1, so I purchased this product.  It was very easy to install (it just hooked right in once I removed the cover), and I was able to image my laptop easily using the EaseUS software and a SATA to USB cable adapter. It was the first time I ever tried doing anything like that and it worked perfectly. I have had had no issues with the new computer finding the drive, or moving things to or from it.  Everything that was copied onto it worked perfectly once I booted up the system. It doesn't get hot and the majority of the storage was available.  My other Crucial products have lasted for years so I'm hoping the same can be said for this.  If I encounter any issues later on I will update this review."
"A Timely Upgrade from Traditional Hard Drives:The Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA SSD is a stellar choice for those looking to upgrade from older SSDs or move away from traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). As a user who has experienced the disappointment of a HDD failure, the switch to this SSD was not just an upgrade, but a necessity.Rapid Performance and Vast Storage:One of the most noticeable improvements is the boot time. The BX500 SSD offers a significant boost in speed, reducing the time it takes for your system to start up. Additionally, the 1TB storage capacity is a substantial upgrade, especially for those transitioning from lower-capacity drives. This ample space is ideal for storing a large array of files, applications, and games without worrying about running out of room.The Benefits of SSD over HDD:It's important to highlight the advantages of SSDs over traditional HDDs. SSDs, like the Crucial BX500, offer faster data access speeds, which means quicker boot times, faster file transfers, and overall snappier system performance. They are also more reliable due to their lack of moving parts, reducing the risk of mechanical failures. The energy efficiency of SSDs is another plus, as they consume less power, which can be particularly beneficial for laptops by extending battery life.Durability and Longevity:SSDs are generally more durable and can withstand physical shocks better than HDDs. This makes them a safer option for mobile devices and for users who are on the move.Ideal for New Builds and Upgrades Alike:Whether you're assembling a new PC or upgrading an existing one, the Crucial BX500 1TB SSD is an excellent choice. It's suitable for a wide range of uses, from casual computing to more demanding tasks like gaming and content creation.Verdict:In conclusion, the Crucial BX500 1TB SSD is a highly recommended upgrade. Its combination of speed, storage capacity, and reliability, along with the inherent benefits of SSD technology, make it a wise investment for both new builds and upgrades. The peace of mind that comes from using a more reliable and efficient storage solution is invaluable, especially for those who have endured the frustration of HDD failures."
"The product arrived well packed and protected in its box.The installation was supposed to be quick, but since it comes with a built-in heatsink, I had to remove the one that comes by default with the Gigabyte Z790M AX ICE motherboard and I was missing the screw to secure it. So, you know, get one.I just installed it as the main operating system disk in the slot closest to the processor and it works very well. I recommend downloading the Samsung Magician program to control the LED light and monitor it.I also took the opportunity to do some reading and writing tests and I think they are within expectations.So far, this product is going very well for me. I recommend it."
"The Samsung 990 Pro with Heatsink is a game-changer. As a demanding PC user, I needed a drive that could keep up with my intense workloads, and this SSD delivers.Pros: * Lightning-Fast Speeds: The read and write speeds are absolutely insane. Boot times are nearly instantaneous, and large file transfers are a breeze. * Robust Performance: The included heatsink ensures optimal performance, even under heavy load. No more worrying about thermal throttling. * Sleek Design: The sleek design and RGB lighting add a touch of style to my build. * Reliable Storage: Samsung's reputation for quality and reliability is well-deserved. I have complete confidence in this drive.Cons: * Pricey: While it's a premium product, the performance justifies the cost for serious users.If you're looking for the best performance and reliability, the Samsung 990 Pro with Heatsink is the way to go. It's a worthy investment that will future-proof your PC."
"23 June 20241) SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD NVMe M.2 PCIe Gen4 MZ-V9P2T0B/AMSold by: Amazon.com Services, Inc $169.992) Thermalright HR09 2280 PROSold by: Thermalright Direct $8.993) Noctua NF-A6x25Sold by: Noctua Cooling Solutions $14.95TLDR: Good M.2I decided to go ahead and put a heatsink on this. Heat has been, is and shall always be the #1 enemy to electronics. Unfortunately, heat dissipation engineering is often underrated, overlooked and badly done, if done at all. With this setup, it never gets above 30c during Samsung Magician performance test. Base mobo temp is 29C.Before attaching the HR09 I removed the sticker form the M.2, the silicone pad from the HR09 and applied Prolimatech PK-3 to the HR09. The picture shows TF-7 but I found that stuff way too thick and didn’t spread well. I used Acetone and q-tips to get the sticker gum off the chip tops. The bottom of the HR09 is steel and really needs to be aluminum but the chips are on top of the M.2 so that is where the most heat can be dissipated. I then attached an NF-A6x25 to the HR09 using some nickel wire. I also needed to augment the foam pad between the M.2 and the mobo. Without doing these mods, it was as if the HR09 wasn't there.My tried and true method of applying heatsink paste that works perfect every single time, no fuss, no worry, and gives visible indication it worked and that the paste isn't old dried out beyond it's shelf life: Every heatsink is always a mm or two wider than the object it is sinking. Simply run tape down the sides a mm or two in from the sides and spread paste on with a single edged razor blade. The narrow thin tape on the edges act like runners for the razor blade to skate on. Hold blade at an angle, it isn't critical, between 10 and 60 degrees doesnt matter. Then peel the tape off. Apparently I didn't take a picture of the HR09 when I did that so I am including a picture of the CPU heatsink done in the exact same manner to give you the idea. They really should include some narrow, thin cellophane tape and a single sided razor blade instead of a uselss spatula.Great drive for a reasonable price. Very fast."
"I recently installed the SAMSUNG 990 PRO Heatsink SSD 4TB in my gaming machine, and I’m blown away by the performance. The installation was straightforward, and the heatsink is a nice touch – it keeps the drive cool during long gaming sessions. As for speed, this thing is insanely quick. Load times in games are almost non-existent, and transferring large files is a breeze.The 4TB storage is more than enough for all my games, videos, and other files. I noticed a big boost in overall system performance, from faster boot times to smoother gameplay. If you're looking for a high-performance SSD that’s built to handle gaming demands, the SAMSUNG 990 PRO is a great choice. Definitely worth the investment!"
Easy and fast to install and transfers data even faster.  Great quality and value for the money. Designed to fit into small spaces and no noise. Very good quality.
"For those of you that were wondering if you can use this with your XBOX Series X/S - YOU CAN!  I put this in a SABRENT Rocket RGB USB C 20Gbps M.2 SATA/NVMe SSD Enclosure (EC-RGBG).  Two things that you need to be aware of.  First, you need to use your computer/Laptop to allocate/initialize this hard drive (under Computer Management/Disk Management) and then you can format as NTFS.  Second, since my XBOX does not have a USB C input for external hard drives you cannot use the cable that comes with the Sabrent above (USB C to USB C), you will need to use a quality high speed USB A to USB C cable (3.1 Gen 2 capable of 7500Mbs or higher).  After doing all of this, you can then connect to your XBOX and it will recognize it as an external hard drive and prompt you to format it for XBOX.  One final thing is that if you are writing a lot of files to this, it will get hot which may cause the transfer rate to slow down.  Just don't forget to remove the plastic protective film over the built-in thermal padding for heat dissipation in your Sabrent enclosure before putting it back together.  Since this does get hot on the exterior with use, the aluminum body must be doing its job to dissipate the internal heat!"
Amazing and fast can't get any better and the software from samsung monitoring is easy and simple
These SSDs are fast and are always cheaper than the non-heatsink versions. I am happy with performance and qualityI have 1 TB 980 version and 2 TB 990 version. Very easy to install and set up

"SanDisk 2TB Portable SSDThis is a nice little external hard drive. Read and Write Speed is very fast, which is great for downloading my wildlife photos quickly.

This back up drive is reasonable fast. compact and easy to use.
My first external SSD.  It works great and thats it.
The SSD works great and has a massive storage capacity. The price was reasonable. I have been using it for a while now without any issues.
"The SP 512GB SSD A55 has been a fantastic upgrade to my system! With 3D NAND technology and SLC cache performance boost, this SSD has significantly improved my computer's boot times and overall responsiveness. Programs load quickly, and file transfers are super fast compared to my old hard drive.Installation was easy—thanks to the SATA III 2.5"" format, it fit perfectly into my laptop without any issues. The 7mm slim profile is a nice bonus for compatibility with thinner laptops. Plus, with 512GB of storage, there's plenty of space for my OS, applications, and a good chunk of games or media files.For the price, the performance is top-notch, making this SSD an excellent value. Whether you're upgrading an old system or looking for additional storage, I highly recommend the SP A55 SSD. It’s reliable, fast, and gives a noticeable boost in performance!"
1TB for under $50 is a fair price for such a decently spec’d SATA SSD. I used this drive in my user upgradable MacBook Pro with very solid results. It installed without a hiccup and formatted without issues. It is a noticeable improvement over the standard rotating storage included as standard. I don’t know how long this drive will last but I have purchased other SSD’s from the same brand and they are still going strong 4-years and 7-years later. That doesn’t always translate into like performance and/or longevity but based on my previous experiences with this brand and the price of the drive I wasn’t concerned. Fast with plenty of storage space available at a relative bargain.
Performance was as advertised.
"I bought this Silicon Power solid state hard drive to use in an old HP TouchSmart 600 all-in-one that I bought back in 2011. The short story is that I was able to get it work. However, it was not a straightforward as will other brands.As I mentioned, I bought this computer in 2011. It had Windows 7 on it. In 2021, the hard drive was about to die, so I replaced it with a modern solid state hard drive (Samsung brand). Because the newer drives are smaller than the one that came with the computer, I used a 2.5"" to 3.5"" caddy to hold it. I installed Windows 10. I just followed the install wizard and everything went smoothly.Last week, the power went out and my computer wouldn't boot up. Everything (including the hard drive) passed the checks, but it was super, super slow. I tried to run restores from USB and DVD. They would kind of run, but so so slow, I was unable to troubleshoot. I also tried to install Windows again, but it failed each time. I decided to buy the same Samsung HDD thinking it would be cheaper now (3 years later) but it was actually $10 more. There was a suggestion for the Silicon Power brand (same size and everything) and it was half the price. I have 5 or 6 USB sticks from Silicon Power and I like them, so I bought this one instead.It was just as easy to install into the computer, but the Windows installation did not work. The wizard would not allow me to choose any partition. They were all GPT (and needed to be MBR). I googled and read about some fixes and then watched a couple videos. Basically I had to pull up the command prompt (shift F10) then enter disk partition mode (diskpart), list, then select the disk, clean it, and then convert to mbr. Once this was done, then I refreshed the wizard and it allowed me to choose a partition. And then Windows 10 installed without an issue.I did not have to do any of this when installing Windows 10 on the Samsung hard drive (same computer) three years ago. The issue for this Silicon Power hard drive is that it came as GPT (not MBR) and it was already partitioned (4 partitions). I don't know if this is how all of them come. Maybe this was a used hard drive, returned, and then resold (without reformatting it). I am not sure. But it seems odd that it would come with 4 partitions.The drive is working fine. I am typing this on that computer right now. So  I would give the hard drive 5 stars, if not for the way it came (which required extra time to research and stuff). I believe that could be an issue for many people.note: I wrote this review a long time ago, but it appear I never clicked the submit button, so submitting it now."
Put these in two older laptops a Toshiba P775 and a DEll Inspiron 7720 both are going on 13yrs old they needed updated to Windows 10. Windows 7 and 8 are in the history books. No more support. Good laptops to do this upgrade with. These SSD drives are very good for this purpose to get more life out them. I did notice a couple of good things after install both laptops run much cooler over the older HDD drives. The overall performance of the laptops was a 100% better for both. I'm holding off for now on  getting new laptops that would well you know cost a lot more than two ssd drives. Will update if anything changes in the future. Also I want thank SP for the great product can't forget about that!!!
Worked as it should and the speed is also fine.
"These are not a well known brand, nor are they the most or least expensive. Many years ago I began testing different SSD's to find some balance between the high end expensive drives and the cheaper less well known products. I do custom builds, repairs and computer upgrades for friends, neighbors and people in my church, so cost and reliability are both factors. A few people don't have tight budgets, so I run with Crucial, Intel or Western Digital drives. But most of the people I do this for are very budget conscious and I needed something i could support and they could afford. Out of 8 different less expensive drives, the SP drive has provided the value, speed and most of all, the reliability I need. With the newer m2 drives I really love, there is still a use for these 2.5"" SP SSD's for older upgrades."
All is ok
Have had this for a few years now working very hard & is still working well would buy this again
"This mouse is replacing an older wired mouse that I really liked, but after two of those old ones failed within a year, I figured I'd pull the trigger on this one.  I was not disappointed.  It feels good in the hand, has a great DPI adjustment, and ALL the buttons are programmable (including the stock DPI settings button by the scroll wheel).  The included weight disk to put in the bottom is a nice feature, too.  I like a heavier mouse.I leave the ""bling"" (the RGB lights) turned off to extend battery life between charges, and it lasts me days without getting low doing it that way.  If you MUST have the RGB switched on, it will drain the battery faster, but it comes with a handy charger/dongle adapter which you could even use as a wired mouse if you really wanted to.  All in all, one of the better mice Logitech has made in recent years."
"I originally purchased a G305 Mouse.  It replaces the Microsoft 4000 mouse that I had been purchasing for years.  The G305 had a bad dongle, so I purchased the G703 as a replacement.The G703 is a great mouse.  I like where the charging port it and the guides it uses to secure the cable to the mouse.  So far I have been charging it once a week and have never run out of battery power.  If you download the G Hub app, it will let you know the battery level and charging progress.  It's pretty much required if you like a higher sensitivity for your mouse setting.The one beef....  Logitech... could you have a socket for the dongle to be placed in.  I travel a lot and take it with me.  I am always worried about loosing the dongle."
"UPDTAE: JAN 6, 2022. ive had this mouse for a month now and till now I have 0 double clicking issues. I use a double click detector on google site, everyday since I've got this mouse I test 200 clicks on left and right click. I get 0 double clicks error.Also the logitech software on PC has been updated and I have 0 issues with it as mentioned on some of the reviews on here. Also the range and disconnecting issue I have not encountered them ( PRO TIP: USE the cable extension that it came with as this acts as an antenna extender and place the USB dongle away from your PC, metal, or any electronics that can cause interference. Also make sure to separate from other wireless dongles IE: Logitech G915 Wreless).As for its size and ergonomics, it is very comfortable to use.  I have very small hands and it's comfortable for me. It's works great for palm gripper of ypu have small hands.Old review:I was very skeptical about purchasing this but It's been 3 weeks and NO double click issue that people are reporting on other reviews. Very light and premium build. It uses the same Hero sensor as the more expensive G pro  for a lot cheaper price. It's ergonomic and it's perfect for palm grip. Other grip style works well IF YOU HAVE BIG HANDS. For smaller hands palm grip works well. RGB is nice without over doing it. The material they use are premium and there is rubber pad grips on the sides to help slippage. The left/right and side button clicks are one of the best feeling in the market. The wheel scroll is also very good. Unfortunately there is no infinite scroll but it's NOT deal breaker what so ever. ONE of the best gaming mouse I've used and it's very sleek looking. Other gaming mouse looks over done with a transformer look to it, which I hate. Lots of good review on YT"
"This is a review for the Logitech G703 wireless mouse. I have had two in a three year time span.I am generally a fan of this mouse.I won't speak to the shape of it too much because that is very subjective per each individual. I will note, though this may be obvious, that the G703 is definitely designed to be a right-handed mouse. I personally find it ergonomic to use - I am right-handed, hand size is 10cm wide by 17cm long, and use this mouse mostly in a claw grip.The long-standing gripe with the G703 is that the scroll wheel tends to flake out, and my first purchase of the G703 was no exception to this. For me, the scroll wheel issues started to occur three years after purchase. The issue is that the scroll wheel would sort of chatter and spaz out on screen - the physical scroll wheel works fine mechanically, but the scroll wheel input is wildly inconsistent. For example, if you scroll down the same exact way three times, you may scroll down normally on the PC the first time, then the second time it actually scrolls up (even though you physically scrolled down) and the third time it will scroll down but at a very different rate than before.I worked with customer service to diagnose the issue and they could not find a mechanical problem. I eventually took the mouse apart and can confirm that there is no mechanically broken component or debris in the mouse to cause this at a mechanical level - there is likely something wrong with the actual electric or software components of the mouse.Other than that one big, glaring issue, I really like this mouse! I use it mostly for office work and internet browsing, though I have also used it for gaming. I am not a pro FPS player and cannot comment on the super fine details like latency and pixel/DPS accuracy, but I use this mostly on wireless and see 0 issues on my end."
"This is, in my opinion, the most ergonomic mouse that there is. I've used the full lineup of the g series mice and this one takes the cake. Only complaint is the bulkier side buttons, just like the 903. I would prefer them to be more like the g-pro or the 305. I don't mind the side buttons, I just know they could be better. Even with that minor setback, the way this mouse feels in my hand is nothing short of amazing. Buttons are all super satifying and responsive. I will absolutely be buying this product again. I would say this is my forever mouse."
"My favorite mouse by miles. Went from a Mamba Elite to this and will never go back! Great performance and battery life, comes with an extra weight too if you prefer a little heavier feel. All in all it's an incredible mouse and I love it!"
"I recently upgraded to the Logitech G502 X Plus Lightspeed Wireless Optical Mouse, after having the same $15.00 mouse for over 7 years. and I’m thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Its lightweight, has a long battery life, ability to change DPI on the fly, and simply looks clean.Performance:The LIGHTSPEED wireless technology is a game-changer. I’ve experienced zero lag or connectivity issues, which is crucial for any game, rather it be Stardew Valley, or high precision requirements such as CS2. The HERO 25K sensor is incredibly accurate, offering pinpoint precision that has noticeably improved my in-game performance. The adjustable DPI settings are a huge plus, allowing me to switch between high and low sensitivity effortlessly.Features:The mouse has 13 customizable controls for you to assign shortcuts/hotkeys too for MMORPG gaming, or MOBA gaming. Changing these hotkeys is simply one program away, downloadable on the Logitech Website. Use of this application also allows the user to change the RGB patterning that is displayed along the mouse. The G502X does also feature the ability to use PowerPlay and charge your mouse, wirelessly, with an additional purchase of course.Cons:With anything the cost can be pretty high for this peripheral, especially if you purchase the additional PowerPlay ability, this Mouse + Pad could be fairly expensive.Overall, after 1 month I am highly satisfied with my purchase, the mouse is just so comfortable to use for 8+ hours of desk work, or gaming activities."
"Easy to connect and use right away. The battery life is incredible, so you don't have to worry about running out unless you forget to charge it multiple nights in a row. Though its slightly heavy, the pads on the bottom are very nice, so it glides across mousepads easily, and feels agile. The buttons feel nice, and the RGB is good. The only issue is that the Logitech Hub app is somewhat unreliable, but otherwise the mouse is excellent."
"I've been a long time user of the G602 and G604, but both were heavy, and the 604 replaced the 602, and has since been discontinued and not replaced.  So after searching for mice with extra buttons near the thumb but also comfortable with a lot of the features I've loved in the 604.  While the G502 X didn't fill all those needs, it's been a great choice.Pros:- Ergonomic - It just fits my (rather large) hand well in a few different positions, and is so light I've found my wrist fatigue has been reduced significantly. Unlike the 604, I can press every button easily without looking for them, particularly the scroll wheel, DPI adjustments, and 3 easy to find thumb buttons is great. It also feels comfortable, which is hard to describe, but the material feel is what I want in a mouse.- Light - I mentioned this in the ergonomic part, but its super light.  Apparently it's around 105 grams, which can be heavy for an ultra-competitive mouse, but for most gamers or folks just looking for a light wireless mouse, it's great.- Great button feel - The older Logitech mice used to have a weird mushy click and my old 602 and 604 both had issues where the button would stop working well.  The new G502 X models have a new mechanical click that feels amazing. Very much like a mechanical keyboard as far as consistancy and feedback.  Not every button has the same feel, but they all feel very tactile and reliable.- Great battery life - I can get 3 weeks on a full charge at 1000 hz poling rate.  Don't bother with smaller polling rates, as when the mouse isn't being used it's not a power issue, and when it is in use, it's still not a huge power issue.  You might get a few extra days at best, but if 3 weeks isn't enough charge time for you, I'd be shocked.- USB-C charging - Sad that this is still a plus, but USB-C cables are so much better.  Glad we're finally starting to no longer see Micro-USB cables.- Works Wired  - Forgot to charge it?  You can use it wired, or use it while charging (Either works).- Great sensitivity - The mouse is so adjustable, I found I could turn it down from my usual DPI and get both great responsiveness and accuracy with a near default config.- Customizable - Logitech G software has flaws, but it does allow some pretty good versatile configurations. Every button can be remapped and remapping can be done on a per-app basis.- Logitech Support - I've had multiple issues with Logitech mice long into their service but under warranty, and Logitech has always been easy to work with to get a replacement or help.  This sounds like I'm saying Logitech has a quality issue, and I'm not, I know stuff happens, particularly with high use products, so it's good they stand by them.Cons:- Large - It's not a small mouse, so if you have small hands, it could be a little large for you.  It also means it's not easily portable, though honestly mice aren't that large in general, so portability isn't a major concern, and you can always get a mouse case if you travel a lot and want to protect it.- Logitech G Software sucks - I mean, it does OK, it can auto-sense games, you can copy profiles, but it has several general flaws, including if it detects a new game it generates that game's default setting that you CAN NOT CUSTOMIZE ahead of time.  If I have a known default mapping/DPI setting I know I like in most games, why can't I make that the default? Also, making button changes and navigation of the US is very unintuitive.  Like one of the worst UIs I've worked with on a major brand's software.  It also by default likes to spam notifications that is harder to turn off than I would have liked (Otherwise, every time the mouse gets touched, you get a windows notification or 3 about the mouse and DPI changes).  Their old software (pre 2015) was easy to use, and worked in the UI was nearly the exact opposite of this.  Fix your software Logitech!- No backup gliders - Not a deal breaker, as I know I've not had a mouse with glider issues in the past 10-15 years, but it would be nice, particularly on a gaming mouse where if the pads wear it could be noticeable for some. I don't need stickers Logitech, I'd rather have a replacement pad set.- No pinkie rest - Some mice have a nice pinkie rest that helps you relax your hand a bit.  This mouse does not. That's definitely a personal thing, and honestly most gaming mice have moved away from this due to weight, but with a large hand, I like mice with them.Overall, it's a great mouse with a lot going for it. I'm enjoying using it, have found my hand/arm feel better after a day of using it vs my old mouse, and love all the features it offers that I can look past any small shortcomings.Who do I recommend this mouse for?  Artists who need finite DPI control.  Office workers who want a bigger mouse (there are cheaper options, but it's a solid productivity mouse).  People who use their computer for a significant time.  Casual gamers. Competitive gamers who want an all in one mouse.  It's a good mouse for a lot of use cases, which is why I'm giving it a 5 star review.  It's not perfect, but very few products are, and it's strong where it needs to be."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



they get what you pay for scenario, and you get a lot for your money with this bad boy. It is feature packed I could go on forever talking about it, but you can find all those features listed elsewhere. Ergonomically is very comfortable to use for long periods of time and has excellent battery life in real world usage As well as being fully programmable/customizable.  I've had some pretty high-end mouses in my day from Razor and other companies and not much if anything can out compete this, if so it's by such a slim margin you would never notice. The coolness factor is off the charts as that's the first thing people notice in my entire set up full of the coolest gadgets like a Divoom Time Gate and stuff like that everywhere so much that my media room/man cave Is a tech gadget Wonderland of tasteful items and almost 20 sets of Almost everything Govee lighting has to offer to top it off.  just keep an eye out for sale as it's obviously not the most affordable mouse on the market, but nobody ever regrets purchasing the best quality product, you'll never sit there months later thinking, boy I wished I had a lower quality mouse, as you will forget about the price pretty quickly, but you will be stuck with whatever most you buy, So depending on the application get the right mouse for the job so you have no regrets.."
"Have been using Uhuru mice for almost 4 years now.  Typically have to replace them annually, and have had to utilize the warranty a few times.  Replacing the mouse by warranty, if defective, is not an issue.  Customer service is prompt and ships a new mouse out free of charge.  As for life span, most gaming mice I've trialed typically don't last more than a year, so that isn't an issue.  The mouse has multiple DPI settings that can be preprogrammed, is comfortable for hours of continued use, has sensitive click buttons, and is pleasant to look at.  As for cons, there is only one DPI button that has to be used to cycle through all settings, rather than the WM-07 that had a forward and backward button.  Also don't advise packing the mouse for travel frequently if you need something for the office and at home, as the components tend to be a bit fragile.  However, with the mouse being cost effective, it wouldn't be difficult to keep one at the office and one at home.  Overall, I have no desire to stray from the brand and plan to remain a Uhuru customer for the foreseeable future."
"I chose this mouse because of its unique appearance. I love that it changes colors and has a fun and sleek design. It's responsive, colorful and I really enjoy it so far."
"Update:So, after my first review, I was contacted by the seller and they offered to send me a new mouse because they determined the lagging could be due to a sensor issue. Their customer service was top-notch and surprising because no other seller has contacted me to give their product a second chance. This mouse also has a 12-month warranty which I didn't know about.I'm really glad that I gave this mouse another shot! There is no lagging issue like the last one had. The previous mouse started lagging on the first day but I have been testing this mouse out for a few days now and there has been no sign of it.The battery life has lasted me a little over 24 hours. The scrolling wheel is smoother than the last one I had and it doesn't feel as cheaply made, like I can crush it in my hand. It actually feels like I got a completely different mouse than the one I purchased.All in all, I'm liking it so far.Original Review:The UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse has several issues that make it a difficult product to recommend. First and foremost, it has serious lagging issues that make it frustrating to use. It can be unresponsive and sluggish, which can be a significant problem for gamers who need precision and quick reflexes.The build quality of the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse feels cheap and flimsy. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will hold up over time, and it could easily break if not handled delicately. The buttons and scroll wheel don't have a satisfying tactile feel, which further contributes to the impression of a low-quality product.The battery life of the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse is subpar, lasting only 3-4 hours on a single charge. This means that you'll need to keep it plugged in frequently, which can be inconvenient and frustrating.Despite these issues, it's worth noting that the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse does have one positive aspect: the changing colors are beautiful. If you prioritize aesthetics and want a mouse that looks good, then this mouse is for you.Overall, while the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse may look nice, it falls short in several important areas and may not be the best choice for most users. If you're in the market for a gaming mouse, there are better options available that provide better performance, build quality, and battery life."
"Mouse linked and worked well right away. Smooth, light and has some great button options on it especially for gaming. The battery doesn’t last real long but for a cheap rechargeable item that’s expected. Takes an old style charger that you don’t get a cord for, so hopefully you have one in the junk drawer or somewhere. Overall it’s great for the price."
"Third review:This is my third review of this mouse in six years. I am now on my fourth UHURU gaming mouse, with an order placed for a fifth as a backup. Like clockwork, these mice seem to last just over two years for me, with heavy every day use (12+ hours per day). This time, my third UHURU gaming mouse had one of the side buttons cave in, similar to my first one. I again could not be happier with my experience. For $20, you're getting an incredibly durable wireless mouse that has a very smooth feel, fits perfectly in the hand for someone with average or above average hand sizes, and looks amazing with that LED lighting and matte black casing.I can't give enough praise to UHURU for this mouse. Unless something drastically changes, I don't see myself ever using a different mouse at any point in the future. I don't think I've ever had this consistently positive of an experience with any other product on Amazon, this mouse is seriously incredible. I will be sure to come back in another two years with an update after I use my fourth UHURU gaming mouse to death.Second review:I reviewed this mouse two years ago, and had purchased it again to replace the original one I had because after two years of extensive use it finally had enough. Couldn’t have been happier with it. The replacement one I received also lasted two years for me, with extensive every day heavy gaming use. I literally use it actively for 12 hours a day or so, every day. Everything I do in life is from my computer, and this mouse has weathered that storm for two years on two separate occasions now. Last time one of the thumb buttons finally had caved in, this time it’s just slowly dying, randomly turning off while plugged in. Again, couldn’t be happier with how long it has lasted and how much it has endured. I cannot recommend this mouse enough for anyone out there, regardless of your situation. I have now ordered another one, and will update again in another two years!First review:This mouse is amazing, regardless of the price, but the price just makes it that much better. I purchased this mouse in January of 2018 and today, in April of 2020, it finally had its first problem. One of the side/thumb buttons caved in, basically, which is the result of heavy use over a long period of time. I have already placed an order for a new one, and my girlfriend is excited to use my old one since she doesn't use the side buttons and it still functions perfectly otherwise.It's hard for me to find wireless and comfortable gaming mice that have acceptable performance, but this one had it all. I can't tell the difference in delay between this wireless mouse and other wired mice. On top of it, it's very comfortable. I have a slightly above average hand size and with most mice it's hard for me to find a comfortable way to grip it and use it, but this mouse is the perfect size and I'm not having to stretch my fingers to reach any of the buttons, they're all in the perfect place. It's very responsive to movement, and unlike other wireless mice when it goes into power-save mode and you have to click to wake it up, it doesn't send a ""click"" command to the computer, so if it went into power-save mode while the cursor was over a button, it wouldn't click the button when I wake up the mouse, which brings me to its incredible battery life and charging speed. I thought for sure with the LED lights and low price the battery wouldn't last very long, but it lasts me multiple days on one charge before I need to recharge it. Then, when I need to charge it, I just plug it into my computer and it becomes a wired mouse for about 20 minutes and then it'll last me a couple more days with heavy use.The bottom line is that if you're looking for a great wireless gaming mouse at an affordable price, stop looking, you've found it. There's no reason not to get this mouse if you're a gamer. If you're not a gamer, there's probably cheaper mice out there that'll do what you need it to, but for gamers this is the perfect wireless mouse."
"It came with the mouse, a charger and a chip. The battery lasts about a couple hours (3-4). works well and clicky mouse. The cable is quite long and it takes about 30 minutes to charge from 0% battery to 100% battery. fits nicely on my hand and comfortable. I would recommend this mouse."
"Great price. Fast shipping. The product works as intended, only problem is the battery doesn't last long but it's rechargeable so it doesn't matter"
"I’m really happy with this webcam. I use it for Zoom work meetings, and it’s been fantastic. The picture quality is sharp and clear, and the microphone picks up my voice well, so I never have to worry about audio issues. Setup was a breeze—just plug it in, and you’re good to go. I also appreciate the added privacy cover. It’s a great value for a reliable webcam."
