It‚Äôs terrible that this product is being sold to the UAE market. Blew my fuses using it.
"Powerful machine. Small size, easy to assemble, easy to store. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Good value. Helps to reduce cooking time."
"nice small chopper, easy to operate, easy to clean, takes up little counter space great price"
"Streamlined design, Easy to assemble and use.Thorough at chopping and pureeing.Cleanup is easy  and quick.  Glad I bought it."
"Note: This is an initial product review after one week of limited and mild use only. I use the machine no more than 45 seconds overall during each use and use it 5 to 7 times a week. I use this product only to blend minced/chunck wet cat food into a patte consistency. This initial review was posted on 28 April 2024. I will follow up with a long-term review, if anything changes.PERFORMANCEPositives:- relatively quiet compared to my old Protor Silex mini food processor- safety feature is intuitive making it faster to start blending compared to my old Proctor Silex- does a good job of mincing and blending chunks of meat.- hand clean up is very easy. I quick rinse the blending compartment, the blade and the top/cover with hot sink water, spray everything with soap and then fill with hot sink water to the top, close the cover/lid & let it sit for a little while in the sink. When I have the time again, I empty the soapy water, rinse everything out and set aside to dry.Negatives- The gap between the low and the high blade is big enough so that anything under 4 oz will not mince or blend evenly. Even after stopping and pushing the food down, 3 different time in-between the blending, chunks of meat still remained unblended. The 5.5 oz can wet cat food blends perfectly in about 20 or so seconds.BUILD QUALITY- After using it in a limited and mild capacity for only a week, the initial impression is that the motor is strong, but overall the unit feels light, plasticky and on the cheaper side. The proctor silex unit felt a sturdier & better built than this. I hope though that this unit lasts longer than my proctor silex unit, which lasted only 8 months of mild use before it died. 30-45 second use, 1 time a day, 5 to 7 days a week."
"I bought this blender a while back and just now getting around to using it recently and I've gotta tell ya, this little blender is very powerful, quick and very easy to clean. Not bulky and a million parts to it. Very simple and I love it!! I almost want to purchase another one as a backup should something ever happen to the one I have now. Highly Recommend this product! You won't be disappointed"
"#####Original Review on August 28, 2024#####Simply WE LOVE IT!!!It works pretty good for small quantities and cleans up super easy!!! Be it chopping/dicing the vegetables into tiny bits or processing the food to a smooth consistency it can do it all either by pulsating or blending it. The blade is thin and super sharp too.We have been using it for several things since we got it a month or so ago and have made several dishes such as Guacamole, Sauces, diced veggies(onions, peppers, carrots), Indian chutneys with nuts and veggies aka Roti Pachadi etc.It's a simple setup of base motor, blade and a lid with a pulsating ON/OFF button; that's it. To clean it I just use a silicon spatula to get all the contents out, then you just need to rinse the blade and the container under tap, apply some warm soapy water and rinse it again....it's that simple. The container, blade and the lid are not dish washer safe as they are pretty light weight.Overall, a great value simple vegetable chopper and processor that works like a champ.########Update October 8th, 2024 ############This has become our go to blender/chopper for all our chopping needs unless we need it a certain way especially for onions, peppers, garlic, cilantro, mint etc. We even threw some chunks of chicken breast, salt, jalapenos, few garlic cloves, onions, cilantro, cumin and coriander powder and gave it a spin for few seconds and this beast was able to mince everything together perfectly without any problem to make some yummy chicken patties...way to go Hamilton Beach!!!"
This is just what I needed: a simple chopper/processor that is easy to use and clean and takes up very little space.
"Just the right size, and powerful enough to do anything I've asked it to do. But the best part is no sliding track to fit everything together. On the bottom, one side of the circle is flat so it's like a notch but a very big one that is so easy to put on the base. Then the cover just sits on top waiting for you to press it. It's hard to describe how easy it fits together and operates. It's that easy. Needless to say, I love it"
"This little machine has a very powerful motor. It doesn’t hold very much but is great for one or two people to chop one or two onions, celery, etc. the only difficulty I have is courser chopping. The motor is so powerful that you literally have to put it on for a second or two before everything is very small. It is extremely useful and time saving. I can normally chop an onion or celery very quickly, but I have a condition that makes my hands shake and are not as reliable as before my illness. I bought this chopper primarily to save my hands from a cut if I slip with the knife, which is entirely possible. A real timesaver in the kitchen, particularly if you cook from scratch all the time as I do. It also cleans very easily. Usually I can just rinse it out and it’s fine. There is no annoying interlock. You just put on the plastic top and push super easy. I highly recommend."
Good  product and proactive seller
"Great product, works well, easy to use and easy to clean"
"good item  easy to use, and easy to clean.. have used it many times and will continue to do so.. im happy with this purchase"
"Really nice product. Easy to use, ( my second Hamilton), just watch out for the slicer blade. I stuck it into a finger while washing. OUCH and lots of blood, but,,,, DOES IT SLICE"
"I LOVE this processor! Excellent build quality. This unit is comparable to a high end robot coupe. The safety lock feature is excellent. Would highly recommend! The blades are extremely durable they are not thin cheap blades. The only feature I have not used is the dough blade. I will review again at a later time, have only had it for two weeks. So far so good!!you"
"It isn‚Äôt the easiest to clean (the lip on the cover is difficult), it isn‚Äôt as powerful as expected either but for the price we are content. It‚Äôs fairly thin plastic which makes it a bit scary to use."
I love this food processor. I really needed something to help me cut/slice because of an accident that left me unable to do certain tasks. This has helped tremendously and it‚Äôs dishwasher safe.
"UPDATE Nov 2024: Its time for Thanksgiving prep, which i use a food processor to cut up the larger amounts of stuff there is, and guess what? I realized i never received the missing slicer shredder wheel I reported within a day of receiving this food processor. I have this life to live, see, so i forgot about it.  So not only did they give me a line about the fact that this was covered by my warranty so they would magnanimously cover for their quality error, but they never sent the replacement. Now I am angrily cutting up a mound of celery.  I went on their website and purchased the wheel for $8.99 + $11.95 for shipping so that i at least have the blasted wheel for future use. Let the record show that i will never ever do business with Hamilton Beach again. There are so many other options that no one has to put up with lousy customer service. OCT2024:I ordered this food processor because I liked the snap on pieces of the plastic cup parts, the size of the cup and that it came with all the pieces I needed for food processing. When it arrived in a box that looked like it had never been opened, the shredder/slicer wheel was missing. I wrote Hamilton Beach via the contact the seller Amazon feature, and the person responding dared to mention that this was definitely under warranty and they were going to wave the $6 fee to ship it that normally applies! Why did they even mention this when it was their packaging quality issue? It should have been ""we're sorry, it'll be there right away!"". Instead, it's been 14 days since I received this product and I still don't have the shredder wheel we need to process the horse radish in our garden.  I might change this to 2 or 3 stars once I finally get the part because the rest of the food processor is nice and works fine. But right now I'm too frustrated. We'll see how long it takes to finally get the wheel."
"It's size is big enough for my cooking, very easy to use. Will recommend to buy this product!"
I hate preping veggies especially  onions . This makes it so much easier. Sticks to the counter and won't start if all pieces are jot together correctly.  Makes slicing for my soups so much faster and more uniform veggies
This item is great value. Easy to use and clean. Everything about this food processor works for me. I am happy with this purchase.
My wife likes it so much. It is easy to use and clean up. It chops vegetables in a few seconds which saves me a lot of time and trouble.
"Excellent product. So easy to use and clean up is a breeze.  I absolutely love all the Hamilton beach products I own.The service I received ; from finding the item I wanted, ordering and getting my food processor in such a timely manner, was phenomenal.  Thank you very much for everything."

It goes together easily. The day I purchased it the price was excellent!!
"Bought it with coupon, very good price. However, it arrived missing in a damaged box and mixing a dough blade. Doesn’t appear to be a used product, so not sure what happened. Returning"
"Love this. I bought for the shredding option mainly. Makes shredding vegetables a breeze. Seems to be a very strong motor. Base is heavy, won’t shift while working with it. All plastic containers/parts feel strong and durable. Easy to clean and store. I shopped around quite a bit before choosing Cuisinart. Very happy with this food processor."
"Cuisinart 9-cup is the perfect mid-size food processor for smaller kitchens that lean towards medium sized recipes. This model (DLC-2009) has been around for many years and is significantly more powerful than 2024 Cuisinart models with similar capacity. It’s relatively quiet, too."
"I purchased a second Cuisinart to accommodate the larger batches of dog food I prepare. Once one learns the ease of use, food preparation is so quick and easy. The weight of the base is manageable but substantial. The containers in which food goes is easy to maneuver and wash. It fits in the top part of a dishwasher. It looks and feels like a quality piece of kitchen equipment. The  performance is excellent. Noise is controlled  by a button which allows the user to pulse the processor thereby giving the user noise control. Performance is consistently predictable. BTW  I believe this was a refurbished product. Thanks Amazon for the savings."
"Fabulous buy for the price. I am so happy with this purchase. The interior is huge. The bowl in the photo is a 3.5c size. Just to give you a baseline of the size. It‚Äôs so much larger than my Kenmore 1000wt that died after only 3.5 years. Not happy with that at all. But I purchased a used-like new that only had a serious bash on one corner that came no where near the unit itself. It‚Äôs in perfect shape and looks great on my shelf unit. I also saved about $100.00 with the sale price and the used price for sure. Very happy camper here. And if I ever get around to reading the manual again it has mute. But the sound is really mild and it goes off after 4 little beeps. Wonderful!!! The Kenmore kept beeping at me until I went and opened the door. An-noy-ing‚ÄºÔ∏èüòÇ  I really like this microwave. It‚Äôs plenty powerful as well. Try it out, you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"The size is exactly I want. Two people in the condo have the idea microwave. I trust the brand: reliable and no trouble at all. My mom had a Japanese clock. Its instruction said 10 year guarantee. Exactly on the 10th anniversary, it stopped. Nobody could fix it. My mom loved it and tried to keep it longer in vain."
After 3+ months of multiple daily use: zero negatives.Functions to love:1. Keypad silent option.2. Decent capacity for all my needs.3. I cook a mondo-size sweet potato every day to add to my dog's food (and mine) ‚Äî the average cook time is 17+- minutes ‚Äî long I know vs an air fryer (just don't have the counter space) ‚Äî I've had no heat-related malfunctions.Great microwave for small apartments and kitchens.
"I bought the microwave in February 2024 and it worked perfectly for 8 months. Then randomly it stopped heating. The light came on, the turntable turned, and it beeped -- the food would just not warm up. I get it though, there are defective products every now and then.The GOOD news is that Toshiba was very good with their customer service. I talked to a customer service person online, sent a few pictures of the model/serial number, and they issued a full refund through the warranty within a few hours."
"I had the big brother of this Toshiba, the 1.2 cu ft. It was great but it was MASSIVE and took a lot of space.  I got rid of it and got me a super compact Chefman  .7 cu ft. Used that microwave for a few months but then it developed a really unpleasant pee odor inside the microwave. Really weird. So i got rid of it and i did a lot of research and decided to get this higher wattage and bigger .9 cu ft size Toshiba.  I am super happy because this Toshiba is still very compact and it looks great too with a bit more power which gets really good reviews in the cooking performance department compared to other more expensive models. So far im super happy üëå"
"[UPDATE at end]  I've owned many microwaves, was the first person I know to buy one, in 1974.  People use to come over to try it, a modern marvel.  And wonder of wonders, this is the only other microwave since that original one (a Gaffers and Sattler) that explains in the manual how to make creative use of aluminum foil in the microwave!  I didn't know you could still do that.  The purchase was worth it for that knowledge alone (I was an old hand at using foil- on the wings of chickens, with rolls, bread, things that cook too quickly compared to other parts of the meal).  No scrimping on the packaging- it arrived in a heavy-weight box within a box and encased in styrofoam, so no chance of dents or damage, yet easy to unpack.Aesthetically I LOVE this.  I fancy it has a chunky retro mid-century look to it, like what a food replicator looked like on the original Enterprise.  I don't have the best eyesight and the buttons are big and clearly labeled- can see them without my glasses.  Ditto with the digital display, bright green; the light inside is bright too.  The handle is thick and solid in your hand, pleases me every time I use it (haven't had a microwave in years with an actual handle, SO much better, feels decisive, purposeful, kinesthetically pleasing).  The operation is intuitive (for the most part) and basic, well-thought-out, satisfying.  I'm coming from a fancy Panasonic unit with inverter technology that I was in love with, but as is apparently common with Panasonic microwaves it died after a few months.  It's a trade-off- I much prefer the look and operation of this (for example, the Panasonic had no number pad) but it takes slightly longer to cook, but that's okay.Being able to turn the sound off is a blessing.  I'm living in my vintage travel trailer at the moment and have two little finches that don't need to be awakened at all hours (they answer the beeps with chirps).  Relatedly the door makes a rather loud but not unpleasant thunk when closed normally, but it can also be closed gently, more quietly when desired- after a week it's already second nature to me.  The microwave when running is quieter than most.  Also wanted to say I nearly sent this back because the power level button didn't work.  What an idiot- when all else fails read the manual.  You change the power level AFTER you enter the cooking time.So far I love this thing, and like the many other Toshiba products I've owned over the years, hope it lasts a good long time.  (After my experience with the short-lived Panasonic I got the three-year warranty- a bargain at $6.)  But if it dies or malfunctions I'll update this review.  Thank-you Toshiba!UPDATE:  I had a senior moment and forgot to put the frozen lasagna in the microwave.  I manually set it for seven minutes and pressed start.  I was doing other things in the kitchen and about five minutes in the microwave went dead.  No display, no power, nothing.  It was HOT inside.  Oh great, I blew a fuse or WORSE, I thought.  I couldn't find the owner's manual.  I tried unplugging it, plugging it back in, nothing.  No re-set button on the back.  SO disgusted with myself.  Thought I was going to have to have it serviced or replaced.  About 15 minutes later it came back to life, after it cooled off, good as new.  Thank-you Toshiba!!"
"I've a small apartment with limited counter space. This microwave fits nicely, works well and is quiet."
I love this microwave.  The control panel is easy.  Size of the oven is perfect.  Price was super.  Highly recommend.
"I bought a different Microwave, My Dream Retro Red at a fair price but it was not to be, came damaged and it was the last one.Amazon customer Service blew me away, They had the issue resolved in hours, so I ordered from a Trusted name. Cost more , but it arrived 2 Days early , Loved that. Apparently I hadn't noticed my old micro wave was suffering ...I put a container of corn in one day in front of my Son at 3mins 33secs ..My son was horrified and I didn't understand why until This new one came . Same container of corn done in 1 minute...Smiles*I'm Happy , Can you tell ? ...lolEdit: Hate ruining my own happiness , but I ordered the 1.2 size and that's what I paid for. Got  the .9  and all the prices went up , when you check ...shakes head..Thought at least you could Trust A  Name like Toshiba , but seems even they must be watched like a hawk ..I am not returning  but I am feeling slighted ..The price difference at the time of purchase was very small ...So I'll eat this but watch out folks, pay attention."
"Unobtrusive. Small footprint.  Love that we can shut off the the sound and  the  stand by display (when you press the button to set the time, the display will come on again).  It was the right price.  Does it's job well. Didn't feel we would get our money's worth  getting a more expensive and flashy microwave.  Will buy again or recommend to a friend."
"As someone who values efficiency and style in every aspect of my kitchen, I recently had the pleasure of incorporating the TOSHIBA ML-EM25P(SS) Compact Microwave into my culinary space, and I must say, it has been a game-changer.From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by the sleek stainless steel design, which seamlessly complements the aesthetic of my kitchen. The compact size is perfect for my countertop, saving valuable space while still offering ample room inside for all of my heating and cooking needs.What sets this microwave apart is its intuitive functionality. The sound on/off option allows me to customize my cooking experience, whether I prefer a quiet kitchen ambiance or the reassuring beep of a finished meal. The easy-to-use control panel and digital display make it simple to navigate through the various cooking settings and presets, ensuring perfect results every time.I've found the 0.9 cubic feet capacity to be just right for my daily cooking needs, whether I'm reheating leftovers, popping popcorn for movie night, or defrosting ingredients for a last-minute meal. The rotating turntable ensures even heating throughout, while the powerful performance ensures quick and efficient cooking every time.Another feature that I appreciate is the energy-saving eco mode, which helps reduce energy consumption without sacrificing performance. This not only saves me money on my energy bills but also aligns with my commitment to sustainability in every aspect of my life.In conclusion, the TOSHIBA ML-EM25P(SS) Compact Microwave has exceeded my expectations in terms of both form and function. Its stylish design, intuitive controls, and efficient performance make it the perfect addition to any kitchen. I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and stylish microwave that delivers consistently excellent results."
"After many years of service, my GE SpaceMaker II microwave needed to be replaced. Unfortunately, the line has been discontinued by GE. They offer one model that's close to the dimensions, but the size would not work well for the space I have (built-in shelf). While there are lots of compact microwaves, the issue is the depth -- most are too deep to fit on a wall shelf.This has the proper depth for sitting on a shelf without issue provided that you use a flat pig-tail adapter so that the plug doesn't jut out and prevent the microwave from sitting close to the wall. The width is less than the nearly 24 inches of the SpaceMaker, but I filled the empty shelf space with a storage cannister that I found that matches the microwave.The microwave itself is a basic model that has few bells and whistles. I only use the microwave to reheat leftovers, and this does a fine job of that. Heating is even, and the 700W, while low powered compared with larger microwaves, gets the job done just fine. The controls are easy to use and are very similar to the SpaceMaker controls, which was a plus for me. The fit and finish are much better than other compact microwaves I looked at. It will fit a full-size dinner plate without issue.It's not a perfect replacement for the SpaceMaker, but it's a workable one. It provides good functionality as a basic compact microwave, looks much nicer than you would expect for the price point, and is easy to use. A very good value for the price, especially if you can catch it on a price dip. Five stars."
"The microwave ion our vacation/rental house died. We selected the GE unit, even though it cost a bit more than some competitors for several reasons. First, a longer warranty than most competitors, especially ""brand X"" products. Second, we have GE ""Profile"" appliances in our main home and they have been reliable. Third, it is stylish, with obviously better fit and finish than competitors. After having it awhile now, we have found it simple to use and very efficient."
Needed small microwave to fit on pantry shelf. This one works well -just have to get used to lower power than our built in one had.
Size and look right for tiny house kitchen
"Had to purchase a number of appliances back in 2021 when I moved into my first home ; various brands include Samsung, LG, Cuisinart, Frigidaire and GE.I always considered GE to be a pretty reputable brand. After a condenser in one of their $400 portable air conditioner units completely crapped out, I thought maybe it was just a poorly made unit and a one-off occurrence. However, after seeing the state of this microwave that I purchased in 2021 after a deep clean this week, I am beginning to think otherwise on GE! And now reading reviews with similar issues for the same microwave happening; the white paint chipping off and rust on the ceiling and corners. Pretty sure this is just overall poor manufacturing practices.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a compact microwave. We had to replace this unit immediately as we don't want rust/paint in our food and picked out one from a different brand. This one will not last and not taking chances again on any GE appliances!"
I didn‚Äôt realize this was such a small size microwave.  It is nice and works. But it‚Äôs very small and only 700 watts. This is probably best for a dorm or small apartment. My mistake in ordering this.  I will have to get a full size for the kitchen at some point.Fast shipping and easy set up were positives.
"This ia a small, compact microwave which is wonderful for a limited space.  It fits nicely on a shelf in my kitchen above the counter top.  I use it to warm a beverage,sandwich, or small dish.  This unit is well constructed and attractive."
"Nice and compact... taking up very little counter space. - Cooks and heats up food quickly & evenly.Would like it even more... if it had a 24-hour clock display (my personal preference.__CONS:1- It produces a LOT of condensation (water). - Most microwaves do... but this one is excessive.So much so that I have to go over the entire interior of the microwave three or four times (after squeezing the water out of the sponge).. to clear up ALL the accumulated water.2- The BIGGER issue IS... the lining of the microwave is beginning to ""bubble"" & separate from the base of the microwave. - And, this is a brand new microwave (3-months old).SEE... the attached photos."
"Approx. 2 months ago (LESS THAN 1 YEAR AFTER PURCHASE) the microwave started to develop a gash on the interior back wall. It progressively got worse with more use. It then started to emit a grey smokey substance which smells like the grinding of metal. It has rendered this unit un unusable. I am deeply saddened as GE products which I have bought & used in the past were among the best quality. I have had to purchase a new one. This unit at a cost of $240, did not last 1 year. The supplier refuses to refund my money because the 30 day return policy has expired and the 1 year warranty has also expired. This is unacceptable, as this product is truly dangerous!!!"
"I‚Äôm absolutely loving the Amazon Echo Pop! This little device is a powerhouse in a compact, stylish design. The sound quality is surprisingly rich and clear for its size, delivering great bass and crisp highs, perfect for filling a room with music or getting clear responses when asking questions. The voice recognition is spot-on, and Alexa responds quickly and accurately, whether I‚Äôm asking about the weather, setting reminders, or controlling my smart home devices.The design is sleek and modern, with vibrant color options that add a pop of personality to any space. It fits perfectly on a shelf, countertop, or desk without taking up too much space, and the sound projection is still impressive. The setup was a breeze, and I love the hands-free convenience it offers.For a budget-friendly, space-saving smart speaker, the Echo Pop is a fantastic choice. It delivers excellent value with great sound, smart features, and a stylish look. Highly recommend!"
"I like how small and easy this Echo Pop is to put out and set up. It will fit pretty much anywhere as it doesn't take up much space. And it was a breeze to get it going. First thing I did with it was use the Alexa app to play music from Pandora. It puts out really good, crisp sound for such a small device. Sure, it may not sound super amazing but considering its size I was impressed with the sound quality. Have not had any issues with it except that right after I first set it up, it lost its internet connection. But I just unplugged and replugged it in and that took care of it. I have been using it for a few weeks now and there have been no more issues since."
"Very decent smart speaker, small , cute but loud enough, most important hears me well and understand my accent ü§£I got it with smart bulb as bundle, now I can switch on off my light in room, can turn tv on off and heater as well, I combined this speaker with Tuya IR sensor to manipulate tv and heater by voice . The process of setting up is easy , I asked gpt chat about steps ü§£ works amazingly well. Highly recommend, most easiest experience with smart home I had in my life and I went through a lot ü§£"
"I recently picked up the new Amazon Echo Pop, and while it‚Äôs an impressive little smart speaker overall, there are a few things to consider before making your purchase. First, I love the sleek, compact design‚Äîit's modern and fits perfectly into any room, whether on a desk, kitchen counter, or nightstand. The vibrant color options also add a fun touch, so it can easily blend in or stand out depending on your style.The setup process was incredibly easy, and it integrates smoothly with my other Alexa devices. Voice recognition is spot-on, and I‚Äôm able to control music, smart home devices, and get the latest news or weather without any issues. The sound quality is clear and crisp for its size, making it great for casual listening and everyday tasks.While the Echo Pop delivers good sound for its compact size, it‚Äôs not very loud. This speaker is more suited for smaller spaces or personal use, where you don‚Äôt need booming sound but still want decent audio for podcasts, music, or voice commands.Overall, the Amazon Echo Pop is a solid option if you want a space-saving, stylish smart speaker with Alexa integration. Just keep in mind that the volume might not be ideal for louder, more dynamic audio needs. It‚Äôs perfect for casual listening, but if you're after powerful sound, you might want to explore a larger Echo model."
"The Amazon Echo has been an absolute game-changer in my home! Setting it up was incredibly easy, and it integrated seamlessly with my other smart devices. The sound quality is impressive, especially for such a compact device‚Äîit‚Äôs clear, rich, and fills the room beautifully.I use Alexa for everything: setting reminders, controlling my smart lights, playing music, and even managing my shopping list. The voice recognition is spot-on, even when there‚Äôs background noise. I also love how it continuously gets smarter with regular updates and new features.Overall, the Echo is a versatile, reliable, and fun addition to any home. Whether you‚Äôre a tech enthusiast or just looking for a little extra convenience, I highly recommend it!"
It was super easy to pair and use with my phone and also connects easily with all other Alexa items I have around the house. It's very knowledgeable and can answer questions in no time. Has a good speaker system aswell so if you want to play music in your room or whereever you have it it's a good go. The voice recognition is instantly aswell but also has a button on it if you want to turn off the mic you can. Overall a really good product and a really good entry product to the Amazon Echo series.
"This is my third Echo device and second kind of. First two, Echo Pops, were purchased for my daughter. Actually, after I got one for her, she loved it so much that I decided to get another one for stereo and better sound overall. So she is happy! But the thing is after playing with Alexa while setting up my daughters Pops, I kind of fell in love with this device myself lol. So I bought a 4th generation Echo (thank you for Amazon Prime day and better price lol) and I’m very happy now. So as you can see on one of my pics the Echo is definitely larger than Echo pop, therefore takes a bit of more room which might be Cons for someone, it’s more than twice expensive and still has a white power cord lol. Those were Cons. And other ten thousand reasons to buy it will be Pros. Well the first main advantage over the Pop for me is a noticeable sound quality improvement (which is understandable since the Echo is a way larger therefore a speaker itself is definitely larger). No, I’m not trying to say Pop isn’t good. It’s a great speaker for its size and price, I’m just talking about my preferences now. So for its size and price Echo is an amazing speaker, sound quality is more than just decent, has pretty nice bass, especially on lower volumes, excellent quality built, has a tripod thread (or wall mount or any standard mount screw hole I believe) and has different color choices. Alexa does its job exactly the same way as on Pops (no surprise lol). I’ve got the one you see on my pics (something like blue I believe) just in case, because I’m still dreaming about its larger brother/sister (whatever lol) - Echo Studio. So “just in case” means our kitchen cabinets color surprisingly matches my new Echo so I’m thinking to move this useful companion to our kitchen in the future. I still feel I’m a beginner in Alexa universe so she can’t stop surprising me with my smart devices. With my new Echo I also ordered a smart bulb to see how it works together and of course I’m pleasantly surprised - I don’t have to lift my lazy bottom out of bed anymore, my bedroom nightstand light is voice operated now. Alexa turns it on or off, Alexa dims it to my desired preferences,  Alexa turns it on in the mornings thanks to my routine group setting. Love the feature how easy to listen to my favorite music around our apartment now - I just asked Alexa to play music everywhere and my playlist started to sound on all 3 Echo devices we have (had to create an “everywhere” group before by the way). Just Amazing! I’m not talking about thousands of other features Alexa offers like weather, news, history, songs etc… etc… etc… After my little experience with both Pop and Echo and all the features Alexa offers my point of view about Echo devices changes, and not to Alexa or AI side, they are not perfect yet, but definitely improving, and Alexa works equally on both devices, so here is a matter of future software updates. It changes towards the Echo devices now. I can clearly hear the sound difference, both, in my opinion, perfect for its size as I mentioned above, and especially its price range. Sorry for comparison, but my $200+ Bose speaker sound exactly the same as my new Echo (and Bose doesn’t have Alexa living inside lol (or who knows maybe there is something I’m not aware of yet, but Bose still can’t beat the price). So after my first Echo Pop purchase, I’m impressed again, now with even better sound quality. Even now, during my finger gymnastics writing this review I’m thinking again to buy a next Echo for our bedroom and then Echo Studio for our living room. Oh, then garage, laundry………etc. So pleasant to have that amazing feeling of satisfaction of spending money the right way lol. Hope someone will find my review helpful."
"This was my first smart speaker purchase.  Initially, I only wanted a portable Bluetooth speaker to move between my office and garage.  I didn’t find anything with decent sound for under $100, so I started looking at smart speakers compatible with Amazon and Google.  Per the many reviews I read, both the Amazon Echo and the Google Nest have good sound, but the Echo has better sound than the Nest.  The Echo also has a 3.5mm jack while the Nest does not, so I chose the Echo.  I wanted that jack as a way to connect my Walkman and listen to my playlists instead of using Bluetooth and draining Walkman battery.My Echo arrived a few days ago and here is my review.  Other smart speaker brands like Sonos, Bose, and Sony were way too expensive for my application and many were not fully compatible with all of the Alexa and Google features.  That was a surprise.  Plus, they were still mono speakers like the Echo and Nest.Amazon immediately sent a link so I could start the setup process before receiving the Echo.  That also gave me time to download and take a good look at the Alexa app on my Android phone.  This initial setup process only took a few minutes.  When the Echo arrived, I read the documentation, then plugged it in and finished the setup process using the app.  There are a lot of possible settings, but many didn’t apply to me because I am not using any smart devices.  This process also was easy.I plugged my Walkman into the 3.5 mm jack and didn’t hear any audio.  Later, I figured out that the jack can be configured as an output to another speaker or as an input from devices like my Walkman and the default is as an output.  Problem solved.The buttons on top of the Echo are clearly marked and are raised, so they are easy to identify and operate.  The Echo has some weight to it that makes it stable when placed on my desk or workbench.  It is light enough to make it portable.  The Echo is not considered as a portable device because it must be plugged in, so I added a power supply ($15 on Amazon) in my garage and now I do consider it portable.  The ring at the bottom turns blue when Alexa is connected.  There is a button to turn the microphone off if desired.  The sound is pretty decent; not Hi-Fi but certainly good enough for my purposes and better than the portable Bluetooth speakers I initially looked at.  The Bluetooth connection between the Echo and my Walkman took less than a minute to create.  That’s great because my Walkman has had issues trying to connect to external speakers in the past.  The Echo also recognized a Bluetooth signal from other devices in my house, but I didn’t need to connect any of them.I had not planned to use the Echo as a smart device, but found it so easy and convenient that I am using it fairly often for weather forecasts, to find out what channel a game is on, for current news, and other things.  It’s fun and Alexa answers almost immediately.  Some reviewers complained that they have to repeat requests or speak loudly to get a response from their Echo.  I have not had any issues at all, even with Amazon Music playing and the volume up.The best thing is that Amazon was selling the Echo for half price when I purchased it.  I neglected to choose a color so my order defaulted to blue.  It’s a soft blue and I like it.  The only thing I don’t like, and other reviews have commented on this, is that regardless of the Echo color the power supply and cable are white.  They should be same color as the Echo.So far, I am thrilled with my purchase.  Easy to setup, easy to use, responsive, sounds good, portable, and looks good.  I can operate the Echo either directly through the speaker and buttons or through the Alexa app on my phone.  Both work well.  I started with my phone during setup, but now only use the speaker.Update:  Amazon replaced my Echo with a new one.  The hum problem is now resolved.  It is just as responsive and sounds just as good as the original echo that I returned had has no issues.  Now that I have spent some time with the Echo I am glad I chose it over the Google Nest."
"The Echo 4 is actually beyond my expectations. It is physically fairly heavy, the quality of manufacture and finish is good. There is a standard screw thread tripod socket on the bottom of the Echo 4 and the power cable is about 2 metres long. I have two Echo 4’s which I easily paired using the Alexa app on my iPhone into a stereo group with left and right channels. I was also able to choose several streaming programs, including Amazon Music (default) and Apple Music. You can also use TuneIn, Spotify and Deezer. The amount of bass is very impressive  and a bit heavy out of the box but you can adjust the bass, treble and midrange using the app or by asking Alexa. The communication ring light on the base of each unit is easily visible, it’s very ‘Gort’ in operation, especially in a darkened room. I had seen in some influencer reviews complaints about putting the ring on the bottom but it works well in this location. Alexa, hears my voice even over fairly loud music about 90% of the time and when the music is playing at low levels all of the time."
"Replaced my decade old alarm clock with this and couldn't be happier. She hears me from the hallway. She is like having a personal assistant, which is super helpful for me while recovering from a concussion I got a month ago. I can turn music on/off, volume up/down, set verbal reminders and alarms. With buying a smart plug I can turn my A/C on/off verbally or through the app. I can ask her questions, she's very responsive and hasn't gotten confused by my voice or wording yet. I dont know how I got through the last month without one. I think my Ma needs one for Christmas, dont know what youre missing til you have one."
"It kills me to only give 3 stars for this product because I love the entire Echo/Alexa series but this Echo 4 is just nothing special compared to the other ones and can never hear me when I call it. Sometimes I call it 7-9 times before giving up and asking Google Nest or another Echo device. The ring light on the bottom is a poor design choice as well. There's just nothing new or exciting (besides colour) about Generation 4. Yes she's a bit quicker but sometimes that's a negative because she closes out before you get a chance to say anything/finish your question. Too much hassle to send back but will be last Amazon smart device until they come up with something new/exciting.I can't even find any use or even mention of the zigbee hub. The one thing I love which is probably unimportant to most is the indoor temperature feature. Love knowing the temperature in my room by asking. This is extremely hard of hearing and never wakes up when I ask it to, yet wakes up when its dead quiet. Very strange experience this purchase. Hopefully Amazon can release a fix (OTA) for the hearing issue as its a major issue and walking to control the echo 4 defeats its purpose.Update- no firmware updates have fixed anything yet, I love my echoes but I wish I had of bought another one with a screen as I find those ones 1000 times more useful. A Red ball is cool looking but that’s about it. Having a screen has spoiled me."
"I love the design, the size and feel. The sound is adequate for my night music needs.The voice recognition is poor, making me repeat Alexa often. Whisper mode works well, so I don’t understand why it does not wake when I say Alexa normal voice often.It lost my Sengle smart light just after a month of working perfectly...also a mystery why. Now it will not recognize the light at all. I will have to talk to the nice amazon techies soon."
"There will be plenty of reviews for the Studio in stand alone, single speaker use. It does sound excellent that way. But if you pair two Studios and throw in the Echo Sub, that is an extraordinary composition! That is the way to do the Echo Studio! That is how I'll review it here.I decided I must pair two Studios since I had two Echo Plus's stereo paired with an Echo Sub and it sounded pretty darn good. So I had to try the Studio paired in stereo, and since I had the Sub, I threw that in too. What else am I going to do with it? The Sub added a lot to the two Plus's. I wondered would you even notice it with the two Studios? I'm here to say that you definitely notice it. You notice it's not there, I can tell you.The sound of this whole system (two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) is quite exceptional. I would have to say it's thrilling! Yes, it costs $530 but that is bound to come down and did I tell you that it sounds incredible? It commands a respect, it really does. There is such a depth to this. The bass is deliberate and authoritative. Very punchy. It has exceptional dynamic range (at high volumes this can be startling) and the stereo image is just stunning. An enormous stage. Those 6 midrange speakers sound sweet indeed. Be sure to turn everything up in the equalizer in Audio Settings of the device in the Alexa App. This thing likes loud! It can easily handle max volume for extensive listening.You crank this up to ten and it literally takes over the room. If you can listen at that volume for awhile with this system (you must live without neighbors) you will be found with a huge smile on your face.All of Amazon's music library is now available in lossless CD quality streaming or better, which shines on this. The new celebrated 3D formats also sound excellent, though I thought there'd be more to them (Abbey Road sounded great but I didn't think it was transformed). But anything you play on this will sound exceptional. I really can't believe Amazon has taken it this far from the original Echo. Bravo! I notice that the Apple Homepod is now down to $200 at Best Buy. Would two of them paired sound better than this setup? I truly doubt it. They'd need a subwoofer and none, as far as I know, are available for it.A few things. The circling Alexa lights are now on top of the speaker. You can no longer really see them from the side, which is unfortunate. I love those lights! And two, the Studio comes with this ""spatial"" setting set. I recommend turning it off. In the Alexa app, go to the device and then Audio Settings and below the equalizer is that on off button for the spatial effect. I don't find it adds anything even though it really changes the acoustics. But if you want to hear music as it was recorded, leave this off.Oh, and I have to say that Amazon still does not make it super easy to set this all up. You have to start with a new or deregistered speaker. Set up each separately and then pair them. But it's anything but obvious or close to foolproof. Come on, Amazon!And I feel I must tell you that you can't connect to the Studio by Bluetooth when stereo paired. It will only play through one Studio, the first one you set up. To use the Studios in stereo pair with the Echo Sub, you can only stream. And you can only stream if you pay.Finally, then, these things are big. Really quite large. And seemingly only available now in black, though there's a gray one in Amazon's web site ads. This is not a speaker that sits demurely upon a table. It's almost as big as the Echo Sub, if that helps visualize it. But you will definitely be challenged as to its home, because that is where this will stay, like forever. Especially if you go for the whole magilla. But I urge you to at least try it (the whole magilla!). But be prepared, I guarantee you won't send them back!UPDATE:  After a software update, the Spatial effect is now the preferred way, so leave it on. Turning it off now makes the music too flat. I think it may even turn off one of the mid range speakers. But something's missing!ADDENDUM:After two years, these still shine as brightly as ever. But the thing that must be emphasized is that this system of two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub is designed to take full advantage of Amazon Music’s HD streaming service, since these can work together only with streamed audio. Using that enables you to get at least CD quality audio recorded in lossless FLAC files (what Amazon calls HD, 16-bit/44.1kHz) for everything in the catalog, and Ultra HD (up to 24-bit/192kHz) available on an ever-growing list of recordings. In addition, it is also capable of playing Amazon’s (admittedly still in limited quantity) so called 3D Audio recordings (Amazon Music supports Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio spatial audio formats). If you don’t get the Amazon Music HD package ($12.99 monthly with Prime / $14.99 without), then you will be missing out on what these speakers are designed to deliver. Amazon’s Ultra HD music must be heard on a system that supports it to be appreciated. It truly is something else in audio quality, significantly better sounding than any CD or LP. And Amazon Music’s catalog is growing by leaps and bounds every month. It is currently quite vast, even its Classical Music selection which has exploded in the two years since the Echo Studio was introduced.Using the Amazon Echo Link ($140), you could get this same quality streaming audio (or even better depending on your amp and speakers) for an existing Hi-Fi setup (at least I think you can- there seems to be some confusion about whether it supports the full 24-bit/192kHz Ultra HD), although you could not get 3D Audio with the Link. You could also use the Echo Link to attach any other sub-woofer to your Echo Studio pair but that would also require an additional amplifier thrown in. However, if you don’t have that Hi-Fi system already, these (2 paired Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) are the way to go to take full advantage of Amazon Music HD at a very favorable price. Just compare their cost to that of a good Hi-Fi system consisting of amplifier, pre-amp, two speakers and a sub-woofer as well as the Echo Link you’d need. The Echo speakers here are a definite bargain for getting excellent audio with minimal wires or fuss!"
"The Echo Studio is a quantum leap from any other speaker that Amazon has produced to date. Everything else sounds like a transistor radio in comparison. The sound separation is fantastic and you can actually feel the bass at higher volume levels.There a couple of issues, however. The vaunted 3D sound is a waste on anything other than the songs that are specifically set up for it. DO NOT use it as a default setting. The music that is not 3D will sound muddy and the vocals will be lost in the mix. However, if you turn it off, the music will immediately brighten and the vocals will be clear and crisp. There are a lot of online reviews where they claim that the clarity of the vocals is lacking. That is because they were early reviews and took place before you could turn off the Spatial enhancement option. Second, if you combine the speaker in a group or as stereo pair, playing the amazon music app causes songs to stop playing at random and skip to the next song. I have read online where it stops playing altogether for some people. It does not happen when just playing though a single speaker. I have not experienced the problem, as yet, when playing through the alexa app. However the Alexa app navigation leaves something to be desired. Also the Alexa app doesn’t show the quality of the track that’s playing.Ok, issues out of the way, I have 2 of the Echo Studio paired for stereo and the sound is a revelation. Listening to the White Album in Ultra HD reveals melodies and instrumentation that I’ve never heard before. The clarity of the voices is amazing. It’s like listening to it for the first time. The 3D tracks sound great as well. There is a massive sound stage. The music really does envelop you. It’s not the same as surround sound. So those looking to relive the days of 5.1 SACD and DVD-HD will be disappointed. It’s impossible to get the same effect from one or two speakers. You won’t hear discrete sounds from behind you, but instead you get a full range from in front of you. It’s difference between sitting the front row for a concert (Echo Studio) and sitting on stage in the middle of the orchestra (5.1 surround). I haven’t tried out the pair for fireTV as yet. The current options for Dolby Atmos are limited and I’ve already watched the new season of Jack Ryan, but I may try this at some point in the future.The amazon credit for turning in an old Echo, sealed the deal on getting the second Studio. The wait for a second one was too long from Amazon, so I got it at Best Buy. They also participate in the Echo buy back program. So, I turned in an old echo dot and got 25% off the new studio (the discount is the same regardless of which echo you turn in), along with a $5 credit. So instead of $219 (with tax), I got the second studio for $155 (with tax). Great deal and with the discount it’s about the same price as an Echo Plus.The size may be an issue to some, but it wasn’t with me. In order to accommodate 5 speakers, there is no way for it fit into the same space as the Plus. The space is really need to fit the subwoofer and it certainly makes a difference.So my final thoughts: It’s a fantastic speaker. Much better than anything else you can get from Amazon. The price is right, especially if you turn in old echo dot (any echo really, but the dot is the cheapest of the bunch and you get the same discount). Don’t use the Stereo Spatial Enhancement. The songs in 3D will play that way regardless of the setting and it makes everything else sound worse (in my opinion). There may be point when Amazon releases an update to fix this, but at this point it’s worthless.  I have never had a Bose or a Sonos, so I can’t compare, but I doubt anything in this price range can compete with what the Studio has to offer. If sound quality is important to you and you subscribe the Amazon HD music service (the studio is the only device Amazon offers that can play the Ultra HD music in full 24/196 quality), I would say run don’t walk to get one (or two) of these. You won’t regret it.UPDATE: I did try out the Dolby Atmos feature last night. I watched some of Jack Ryan and Carnival Row. The effect was just as outstanding as the music. Wide sound stage and clear, crisp dialogue. I do think that for watching movies the subwoofer might be a good addition. The bass was definitely present, but I think that the subwoofer would add some welcome bottom to the sound field (Perhaps that will be a Black Friday/Christmas purchase). The setup was fairly simple after restarting the 4K firestick. Initially the firestick was greyed out in the Alexa app, but after a restart it showed up. Set up involved just following the instructions after that.As stated before, there are very few options to watch Dolby atmos enabled content on Amazon. It does not allow it from Netflix, and as of yet, does not have the option for the Disney+. Hopefully that will change at some point in the near future (although I’m not holding my breath). However, since my main reason for buying the Studio in the first place was for music playback, I see the Atmos option as an added bonus.Update 2: they have fixed spatial enhancement mode! It sounds fantastic. If you toggle between the two modes, you can actually hear the sound field shrink. It's now very worthwhile. Also I added a sub to the mix and it does wonders for the sound. If you are using the studio in the kitchen or a home office, one will work spectacularly. If you are using it in a living room or large space then 2 with a sub is the way to go. The sub adds so much depth when you are listening in a larger space. Currently playing through the app is a problem but voice commands still work fine."
This is the second Echo and it works great. The first Echo the screen would go totally off and she was hard to wake up at that point. I let Amazon know and this one arrived the next day. I still have the old one but do not trust it. Excellent Customer Service.
"The Amazon Echo Show 5 is a fantastic little device that packs a surprising punch for its size. The sound quality has noticeably improved from earlier versions, with deeper bass and clearer audio that works well for music, videos, and even alarms. The 5-inch display is sharp and bright, perfect for quick glances at weather updates, recipes, or video calls without taking up much space.The Alexa integration is seamless, as always, and I’ve been using it for everything from setting timers to controlling smart home devices. The camera shutter for privacy is a thoughtful touch, and the device is easy to set up and customize.If I had to nitpick, the screen size might feel limiting if you’re looking for a larger display for streaming or detailed visuals. Also, the speaker is great for its size but not quite room-filling if you’re expecting full stereo quality.Overall, it’s an excellent choice for someone looking for a compact, versatile smart display. Whether it’s for your nightstand, kitchen counter, or office desk, this Echo Show delivers great features and sound in a sleek, affordable package."
"This is my first foray into this technology.  I appreciate the interactive screen [always clear and readable], it has good sound for such a small unit, and was user friendly to setup. I really enjoy the 'hands-off' control of systems in and around the house. A lot neat 'accessories' to control items that I would never thought [but they know I need them]."
"Update to below original review:  Amazon tech support reached out to me to help fix this problem.  So, I have increased from 2 stars to 4 stars.  Still not 5 stars because there is a device problem somewhere.  In addition, I believe the Echo Dot (no screen) is a better device - it ""hears"" better and has better sound.  If you run into the Echo Show going into zombie mode (where it appears to be rebooting, powering off, and repeating a doom loop over and over), try the following:- Put it into factory default mode by holding Mute and Volume Down for 30 seconds until you see three dots appear on the screen.  It should enter setup at this point and if it works after setting it up, good.- If you get through the setup process and parts of it repeat over and over, cycle power for one minute and try again.  This second step was necessary for me but it works now.Thanks, Amazon support!Original review: It never did pick up voice commands a well as our other Alexa devices.  Sound is so-so; the dot is far better.  In less than a year, it recently failed.  It tries to boot up, shuts off, and the cycle continues.  Not what I was hoping for."
It won't respond to my commands sometimesI want it play George Jones and it just stays silent.
"I've been using the Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. The Echo Show 5 has always been a reliable smart display, but this latest version truly steps up the game, especially in terms of sound quality.**Sound Quality:**One of the standout features of this Echo Show is its upgraded sound system. With 2x the bass and clearer sound than its predecessors, the audio quality is surprisingly robust for such a compact device. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. It's perfect for smaller rooms, like the kitchen or bedroom, where you want good audio without the need for a larger speaker.**Display and Design:**The 5.5-inch screen is sharp and vibrant, making it great for watching short clips, checking the weather, or making video calls. The compact design fits easily on any shelf or counter, and the Charcoal color gives it a sleek, modern look that blends well with any decor. The screen's adaptive brightness is a nice touch, adjusting automatically based on the room's lighting.**Smart Features and Alexa Integration:**As expected from an Echo device, the Alexa integration is seamless. Voice commands are picked up easily, even from across the room, and the responses are quick and accurate. I use it to control my smart home devices, set reminders, and even follow along with recipes. The new smart display features also make it easier to see and control multiple smart home devices at once, which is a huge plus for someone like me who has a lot of them.**Privacy and Security:**Amazon has included a physical shutter for the camera, which provides peace of mind for those who are concerned about privacy. There's also a mic/camera off button, which is easy to use and effectively disables both the microphone and camera.**Overall Performance:**The Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. It offers a great balance of audio quality, smart features, and privacy controls. Whether you're new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, this device is definitely worth considering. It's small but mighty, and I find myself using it more than I expected for everything from checking my calendar to watching cooking videos."
